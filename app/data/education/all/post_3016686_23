I didn't even know that one of my favorite artists was releasing a record today!   How can that be, pray tell?   urlLink Maura O'Connell's  new CD is called "Don't I Know."  I loves me some Maura, though her last CD was such a dud for me that I listened to it fully only once.  Back with her good producer, Jerry Douglas, the songs on this one are  much  better, though I still have an issue (which surfaced on the crappy CD) with how her voice is recorded and mized. I think the idea is to have her sound intimate, as if she is whispering in her ear, but the end result is that she's mixed a little low and a little "flat." She needs a smidge of reverb, like she has in the live shows. If you don't know Maura at all, every one who loves country, folk and alt pop should purchase " urlLink Blue Is The Colour of Hope " (start with "The Blue Train") or " urlLink Stories " (start with "Half Moon Bay") and be mesmerized by a) the great songs written for her and b) her beautiful thick honey voice.
