For once, I think the DepEd is doing something good.  The  urlLink  Inquirer  publishes a story about adding Muslim education to the elementary curricula.  It plans to  introduce "functional" Muslim knowledge into the elementary curricula to encourage Muslim Filipino children outside Mindanao to attend school.  Functional would mean  historical accounts of the country's 15th century links to Islamic culture.   The plan will not only mean to educate Muslims but non-Muslims as well if it will be included in the curriculum.  While we Christians in Luzon and the Visayas have a general understanding of the Muslims, we take it for granted and believe that this minority group is far from us, hence, their problems do not affect us that much.  But they do. We are primarily responsible for any living being that belongs to our territory, shares our patrimony, history and culture.
