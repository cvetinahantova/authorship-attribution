So as I was walking along the many aisles covered with school supplies, I realized how shit it was going to be going back to school.... Got a lot less than what I expected to get this year, but that's good. :sigh: ONE MORE YEAR AND THEN I'M OUT BITCH! yeaaaaahhhhhhhh...                                                           Bring it on.
