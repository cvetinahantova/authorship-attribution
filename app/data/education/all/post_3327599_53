i went to morris yesterday to celebrate Nate winning custody of Kali.. and Chris told me he wanted to see me when i went down there.. so i borrowed Nicks truck (i love it.. baby blue ford ranger. i look better in it then he does..) to go down to his house. well when i got there i parked behind a white suv and had no idea who's it was.. so i walked over to Chris's truck where he was standing with... MEGAN! the crazy ex gf. i was.. thrilled to see her. Christopher took off and ran into the house and left us out there alone. she just sat there giving me dirty looks and i just smiled because i knew if i didn't i would strangle her. so she got on her cell and i went in the house where Chris was hiding. ya know that look a dog gets when you beat it for pissin' on the floor.. that's what he looked like and ALL he had to say was "kinda uncomfortable huh?". now remember when i said we broke up for reasons i couldn't talk about? this Megan bitch told him she was pregnant which is a bunch of bull shit (i shoulda rubbed her belly and been like "ooo feel that kick? it's gonna be a soccer playa!" too bad i was too mad to do that..) so anyway he's seeing her again i guess, i was soo pissed off. he said they aren't dating but whatever.. maybe they are just fuck buddies. i told him to come get his shit this week and he acted all sad and sounded like he was really upset and said he wasn't in a hurry to come and get it because he wants to be my friend and wants to try again later. i don't really want to beleive him but it's that damn crap with me and trusting and not wanting to hurt ppl that wants to believe him.. damn it i'm gettin' mad all over again. oh well.. i don't care anymore. he can be an asshole. it's guys like him that make me want to be a lesbian. grr.. oh well i'm done with him. all i can do is move on and just hope the next one doesn't screw me over.
