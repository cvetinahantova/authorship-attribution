it works. i'm here.  thoughts on ray?  last album out in august says rolling stone.  duet style ala j. cash.  i'm in. if hawaii was a hot dog would you eat it?  i would.  they're delisous. whittier is hotter than satan's crack right now.  its because the tree is gone.  i told jesse that i'm no longer referring to this dwelling by it's previous name.  to me it is the place-formerly-known-as-the-bayou.  i sat in the hammock (which i have relocated to the only shade spot in the 90601 vicinty) and thought that with this cursed heat the falling of the tree was the christening of a new era (well, that along with many other personal [public and private] struggles that those of our order have dealt with)  any suggestions for a new name.  i thought {@} had a nice ring to it.
