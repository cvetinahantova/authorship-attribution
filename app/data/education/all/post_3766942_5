Ah now, the Irish Laddie... He's been around for a month now, not a record because there is The Nasty Neighbor.... We can get to him later, or early (inside joke).  The Irish Laddie has a perfectly Irish name, and is attractive (almost cute).  Ah but now the man isn't one of your usual men she dates.  This one is without children.  And has never been married you know.  Although the two usually go together, sometimes they are seperated - see JC.  The Irish Laddie is a mighty fine catch.  We're a few dates in, but the calls are slowing down.  I've decided to play Princess Hard To Get with this one... He seems to think the women all fall for him, which I'm sure they do, but c'mon now - he ain't perfect!    I think I'll give him a call tomorrow, and if he mentions going out, getting together, dinner, drinks, something - then it's a go.  If he wants me just as a gal pal he can phone for chat - it's gonna be a dead issue.  I just don't have time for that.
