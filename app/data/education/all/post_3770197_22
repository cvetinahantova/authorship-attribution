First off...  Napoleon Dynamite was absolutely hilarious. I'd say that was definitely the best comedic film of all comedic films I've watched my entire life. This one definitely tops the charts. Aside from all that, I had a pretty good day with Albert. We went to Valley Fair because he wanted to get some decent black slacks for work and some grub to eat at the food court. We headed towards Downtown to watch of course,  Napoleon Dynamite @ 9:30. Man... I think Napoleon Dynamite would be like the most awesome kid at our school if he went to PHHS. With dance moves like that, I, for sure could run for class president and win the elections. His brother, Kip and Uncle Rico are such jackasses dude. I mean seriously. It's fucking hilarious when Kip hooks up with his internet lover, Lafawnduh though. Haha! We went to Denny's after that for some late night dinner. I really enjoyed being in the company of Albert, we always have something to talk about. It's funny though, most of the conversations revolve around Ryan and his lack of "pimp" skills because he's so damn passive. *shrug* Eh well, what can you do right? A few interesting things (and these are some pretty good traits) about Albert is that he's very passionate about what he talks about, and he's always straight-forward and direct with what he says and he goes by what he says as well. Why can't all guys be like that? Anyway, he's a really cool guy-- not too shabby for a second cousin. But what's sad to say is that he's more of a brother to me than my own biological brother. Not only because of distance, but I mean.. Albert calls and talks to more so often than my own brother. Well, I think I'm about spent. I'm going to go watch Requiem for a Dream now.
