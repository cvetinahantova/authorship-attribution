I can barely keep my eyes open (written while trying NOT to read into the extreme fatigue I've been experiencing as a pg symptom...) but I just had to write a little before I hit the hay, especially since I feel like my earlier entry sounded like a bit of a downer...but as I referenced there, like New England weather, if you don't like my mood, just wait a few minutes and it's certain to change!  At any rate, at my grandmother's birthday party today, I held my 3-month old nephew (my first, born two weeks before my first edd) and I didn't feel sad or broken!! I loved holding him and told my brother that I was going to take him home. I was so happy to hold him close, and I didn't want to let him go. It felt so good, since the last time I saw him I couldn't hold him because it just hurt too much...  I am rambling (I do that even more when I'm tired) but just wanted to document an "up" moment. Maybe, just maybe, my heart is beginning to heal...now if I can just get to the day when I hold my own little one, I think my heart will heal, someday.   Patience and faith, patience and faith...
