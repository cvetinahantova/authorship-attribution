It's a book sitting by my computer, and as I can't think of a proper title, I'm using that one! It's a book about a Vet I think, who has lots of animals in his house, including different chickens. Yeah, alright, I  am  just reading the blurb, as I haven't, and not planning to, read it. MSN Plus is so amazingly crap. It makes my Internet windows crash, so I have to shut down my computer and start again.
