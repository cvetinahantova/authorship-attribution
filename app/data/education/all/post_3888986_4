So I ate my granola bar for breakfast - along with my caffeine filled Diet Dr. Pepper.  But then - that's when it went wrong - I ate 4 chips ahoy cookies.  Why?  I was not hungry - I just wanted them.  They are wrong - and chips are wrong - and dog gone it - ahoy is wrong in some way too.  I need to do better - or my "big" pants that now are large due to dieting will fill up with "ahoy" and I will no longer be on the path of dieting.  Ahoy fat - ahoy....
