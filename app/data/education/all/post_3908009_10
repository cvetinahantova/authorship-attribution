Since the moment I spotted you Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes My stomach's filled with the butterflies...(oo)and it's alright Bouncin round from cloud to cloud I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lied  Pre-Chorus Everytime I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied Turns out that everything I say to you Comes out wrong and never comes out right  Chorus So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever Heads we will and tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven Cause without you they're never going to let me in  When's this fever gonna break? I think I've handled more than any man can take I'm like a love-sick puppy chasin you around (oo)And it's alright Bouncin round from cloud to cloud I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lied  Pre-Chorus Everytime I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied Turns out that everything I say to you Comes out wrong and never comes out right  Chorus So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever Heads we will and tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven Cause without you they're never going to let me in  ( Only second time through) And slowly I begin to realize this is never gonna end Right about the same time you walk by And I say 'Oh here we go again' oh  Pre-Chorus Everytime I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied Turns out that everything I say to you Comes out wrong and never comes out right  Chorus So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever Heads we will and tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven Cause without you they're never going to let me in  So I'll say 'why don't you and I get together and take on the world and be together forever Heads we will and tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other and fly to the moon and straight on to heaven Cause without you they're never going to let me in   ---Santana feat.
