November air, sharp and cool and still     Here I lie. Engulfed within a field of swaying dreams;     As they stare- The pin-pricked sparks on eternal light-     Can you hear them whisper?   An opal moon yawns a great white light That washes the world in a lucid illusion.   My mind is lulled by the silence of a million stars     Back into dark woods     With milky blades piercing the sky;     And the carpet of pine     Softens my step.   The air was warm then and I was young;     Imaginations played their games     And fireflies light the heart     While embers of eternity      Soften the passage of time.
