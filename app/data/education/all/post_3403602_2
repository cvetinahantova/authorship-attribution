Hello Today is such a better day. Well I mean the whole day was a big bore. Something soo funny happen. During 5th period me and my friend Lucy were talking about some friends of ours. Then all of a sudden I heard the word "Fight". So I turn around and I see two guys fighting and beating the shit of of each other like if there was no tommorrow. Then I tell Lucy "Look!" She goes "......Oh shit their fighting." And man for two seconds the teacher goes "Hey! Stop!" Then she jumps in to sperate them and they almost swing at her. And man oh man the teacher pushed them to the floor and kick them out of her class room. WHich they were still fighting. Lol. But yeah. I finally said soory to one of my friends mom, Allie. I got her mom's boyfriend mad. Long story anyways. Thats all I got to say. Bye!!XoxO
