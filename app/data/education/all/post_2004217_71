Hola! Life is still unbelievably good, I just don't understand it... The sun is shining, I'm going to Leeds, I'm getting good marks, JYF is approaching fast and according to Debbs, Chris actually likes me... of course, at this point in the conversation I climbed into my jumper and hid under the table, but still, it's a nice feeling, isn't it? :o) I texted him today, just to say hey and (*gasp*) ask him if he wanted to meet up sometime... I suppose I should write something naughty about the thrill of the chase, but... ahhh. :o)  The unfortunate thing about being happy, of course, is that you have nothing to write about; nothing to over-analyse, nobody to rant about. Just sunny, happy feelings. How annoying!   DAY COUNT  Results Day: 2 JYF: 3 Hundred Reasons: 5 Maroon 5: 6  Ceff x   Kiss me, beneath the milky twilight, lead me out on the moonlit floor...
