Well, lots of things happening, a very very tirering week. But I'm not writing all that has happened because is long. It's good though. Anyways, here's a poem I wrote about a month ago.      Sorry, i decided to take the poem out because i'm planing on a groupng some of my best poems to see if i can get published (just for the fun of it. ) :D
