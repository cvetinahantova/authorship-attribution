New Hampshire . . . or Chicago?   The story of the NH GOP primary continues.  I went to the NH Secretary of State's website.  On the page where they breakdown the  urlLink votes by candidate , the total votes ads up to 67,833.  But, on the page where they give the  urlLink votes cast in each primary , the votes total up to 69,379.  That's a difference of approximately 1,500 votes.  Where did they go?
