Well, I've been to a GYM two whole days in a row!  And I feel GREAT!  Do you think this is just a flash in the pan or will I stick with it?  We shall see.  I certainly hope to keep going every night that I can.  I'm not watching TV at night anymore so it's replacing that ~ takes care of the "I don't have time" excuse.  I have gained and lost a lot of weight and muscle tone over the years.  If I could just harness all the motivation and adrenalin and endorphins that made it work before, and tap into it every day, I'll be fine.  Next week I'll be on vacation and I intend to give up caffeine.  I'll have time and be in a place where I can sleep and bitch and moan and relax and just work through it.  Kind of like a detoxification retreat.  I'm also going to work on writing and taking some pictures.  I've been really wanting to take photos of barns.  I know, sounds nutty, but there are some really neat barns out there and I want to capture them.  Maybe do a poster you know, like Barns of Michigan or something.  I'll have to keep track of where I take them.  I don't think my camera is quality enough to make it real professional though.  I'm still moving along nicely with D.  We are going out Friday night and I can't wait.  The tension is building and I don't know how long I'll be able to hold off.  It's been a loooooooooooooong time.  Ciao.
