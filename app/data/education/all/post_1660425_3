I guess this article is about the future of librarian interaction.  Instant messaging has become a standard in the Internet community.  It is fascinating that IM has created its own language for communicating.  This new form of communication has obviously created a new outlet for expression.  Here, a library patron happens across a librarian.  He asks a question for curiosity and a discussion begins.  The discussion continues until the patron has a book set aside for him at the library.  Just like asking questions in person, just of the Internet.  I do see a problem with IM for schools.  That is the ability to communicate with friends via text messaging or IM.  We already have to watch cell phones VERY closely so that students will not text message each other.  If they are caught with their cell phone out or in the "on" position, it is taken away and has to be retrieved from the office.  As technology grows and changes, schools will continue to adapt to those changes.  BC
