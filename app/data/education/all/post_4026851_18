Friday the 13th at-the-bar observations:  --The three "house" specialty drinks are named the  Mongolian Motherfucker , the  Dirty Jamaican , and the  Jamaican Monkey .  Welcome to West Virginia.  Prejudiced, much?  --My best friend and I were sent to the principal's office (first time ever) in the fourth grade for picking on a fat and ugly classmate on the schoolbus.  She was at the bar celebrating her 24th birthday.  She is still fat and ugly.  --One crazy lookin' dude was sporting a ratty-ass striped sweater-- alternating wide red/olive green stripes.  Freddy Krueger-chic.  That was creepy enough... but imagine my surprise when I enter the bathroom later, and there he is taking a piss at the urinal-- bracing himself against the wall with a blade-gloved hand (plastic prop, but still).  I guess his hockey mask was in the wash.
