There is no possible way I can describe to you the beauty and wonder of my trip to Québec. It was a once in a lifetime trip and I will never forget it. I saw beauty beyond compare, intrigue beyond reasoning, and I had the most enjoyable time I've ever had. I will miss the city of Québec and the Québecois, especially Maxime, our tour guide. I will miss all of it. In fact, the only bad part about my trip was crossing the border, knowing that I was back in America and knowing that I was back in a place where all I can hear is terrible news.  So, after spending a whole weekend without television and without interruption from terrible news breaks and whatnot, I have resolved to refrain from watching as much news channels as I used to and watch less television entirely. I am completely sick of the disease of fear spreading throughout America and I just want to bring back as much peace from Québec as I possibly can.   "I'll miss you... Miss you so bad. I can't forget you, Oh, it's so sad. I hope you can hear me: I'll remember it clearly. The day you drifted away, Was the day I found it won't be the same!"   I somehow learned that life is only what you make of it. Your president can control you country, and your news channels can bias you as far as fear and terror go, but the excitement you feel and the wonders you see only come when you want to see it and when you are willing to be captivated by the extremity of the world around you.  Does that make sense?
