I would like to know why I come into the office everyday and do nothing. I totally understand that I am getting paid to be here, yadayada, but damn, it is the most boring thing I have ever experienced.  I don't think that I am alone. The teachers here, running, organizing, filing, yelling 'Hai' when appropriate...they don't have that much to do either. In their minds, they are as bored as me but they don't pull out a trashy novel to read because their mind is unsettled. They talk, they act busy, they answer the phone in an exasperated 'irrashaimasuka.' All of these ploys to trick the foreigner into thinking that they have important business to take care of. Then again, maybe I am wrong.  Unfortunately, such contemplation does not make me any less bored or less willing to read my trashy novel. Luckily, Abra and Jo have introduced me to blogging and now I might be addicted. Why didn't i start this earlier? It is very therapeutic.  Besides the facts that every sweat pore in my body is working overtime, I am also wishing I could lay down in the 'secret' sleep room in the back of the school.  Don't get me wrong...I enjoyed my time here but sometimes you can cut the boredom with a knife.  I have one question left to be pondered by my other blogsters. I saw it on my walk to school this morning. Why do Japanese people where white gloves when driving (and during other activities?)
