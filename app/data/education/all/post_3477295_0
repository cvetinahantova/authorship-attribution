Only a few have seen this new blog. Daniel, me, uhh... and who ever is looking at it right now!  My birthday is coming up! Only a few more days! 14 years on this planet.... How did my parents survive that long without ending my little life?  My mom and dad got my birthday off. I was invited to go to the lake with Bri and I kinda want to go. I'm not sure yet. I hope I can go to church on Sunday though. See DJ right before my birthday! Say "At this time tomorrow I will be 14." (Of course church ends at 10:30 a.m.)  My mom doesn't really like the parking there....  Oh! Just over an hour ago I got a birthday kiss. I feel so special!  Yeah.... I'm random no doubt.  Lysie
