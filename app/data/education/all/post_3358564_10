Love and war are the same thing, and stratagems and policy are as allowable in the one as in the other.  —Miguel  De Cervantes        Don Quixote  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel; For well thou know’st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel...   —William Shakespeare   Sonnet 131    C. Guests .  To prevent emotional turbulence, it is best that  all visitors, welcomed and uninvited , obtain proper clearance. Whether a best friend, classmate, or sociology professor arrives at your lunch table, he or she must adhere to the following protocol:    1. Video tapes will not be permitted in or around the eating area.   Should your sociology professor appear rather excitedly, but uninvited, and produce a video called, “Mama Coca” about the cocaine trade in Colombia, and explain rather loudly while pulling up a chair next to you, “I got it just for you; we are going to watch it in class today,” you might want to shun eye contact with your host while taking the video in hand and expressing your deepest thanks.     If you happen to glance towards your host, do disregard the tempered look, and slight flush to his cheeks.   He hasn’t been feeling well lately, and when the two of you are alone once more he will explain rather pungently, “there’s probably something wrong with my body today...”   But your host’s illness is no cause for alarm, for soon he will be the perfect picture of health when he arrives at the very next luncheon with a former classmate.  After handing her a tray in the gourmet food line, he will turn to you while you are gathering your own tray and inquire like a true host, “So, is Dr. Sociology going to be joining us today?”  You will simply say, “I don’t know.  I didn’t invite him, but he keeps showing up.” To which he will reply: “Well, you are so popular...”     2. All clothing matching personality is prohibited.   When wearing a dress covered in violets, or stylish overalls with flowers printed about, do not discuss poetry, Latin America, or your astronomy class in the presence of your host or uninvited Sociology professor.  Even if the astronomy exam is making you feel somewhat apprehensive, refrain from verbally expressing your anxiety.    Your host may conclude that he would love to see you write an essay in astronomy such as, “If the stars were French...”  Your sociology professor will then concede, “Yeah, look at her clothes—Flower POWER!”  And once more your sociology professor who both you and your host call in secret, “Dr. Sociology,” will state at the top of his lungs, while waving his fist in the air “FLOWER POWER!”  At this point, you may find it somewhat comforting to look at your host’s eyes, for indeed, although he is the catalyst of the embarrassment, he does now seem to regret instigating the said banter.  He will project his, “Ok, so this guy is a little over the top” look, head turned slightly to the left, blue eyes open wide and bulging.       3.  Any direct reference to, or discussion of that word—-LOVE is inadmissible.    When your Sociology professor arrives at your table, once more uninvited, and pulls up a char next to you, proclaiming,“I’m in love,” you want to try and transfer the conversation to a more acceptable subject matter.   Should the conversation go awry; do explain gracefully that you are familiar with the notion of being in love, although you find it somewhat difficult at times.     If your sociology professor identifies the kind of love you are defining as, “A kind of selfish love, where the two of you are not thinking about consequences, but rather lost in your passions,” it is best to keep your head in an upright position.  Do remember to blink and to breathe normally when he continues: “Secret love is hard; any love where you can’t express your feelings is hard; you want the other person, but you just can’t tell them.” Also, you might want to consider implementing  the critical contingency plan: cease and desist from any gazing, glancing, or peeking at your host —-bleeding revelations can be fatal. And for the love of God, think twice before you utter, “Well, I think love like that sucks!”     4. Flirting with either your host or hostess is strictly prohibited . For security reasons,  a zero tolerance policy  is in effect for all flirtatious activity—except between the host and hostess, of course.  In order to prevent the following conversation which could occur the day after you’ve asked your uninvited sociology professor to tell you about his trip to Cuba via Mexico,  the ban on guest flirting will be strictly enforced :    Hostess: (enthusiastically) Hi, how are you today!  Host: You were nice to Dr. Sociology yesterday.    Hostess: Yes, I was.    Host: You’re cruel!   Hostess: No, I’m not. I’m nice; I’m always nice.    Host: No, you’re cruel.   Hostess: I’M NICE    Host: No you’re cruel!    Hostess: I am nice!    Host: Keep saying it; you’ll believe it!   Hostess: Why then, am I cruel?    Host: Because, you’re just a mean, mean, cruel person!   Hostess: Maybe I should sit by myself today; I feel like I’m bothering you...  Host: No, you’re not bothering me—yet!    It is important to note that even before you could sit down and properly greet your host, the first words out of his mouth seem indicative of a severe breech in security.  Likewise, you too might find yourself in a threatening scenario come the end of a luncheon:   Former classmate: I just love your little voice. Don’t you (to host) just love her little voice? (large smile)  Hostess: Thank you. I liked reading your short story.   Former classmate: (insincere) Why, thank you for letting the two of us sit with you for lunch.   Hostess: No problem.  Host: (to hostess) So, are you ready to scram?  Former classmate: (to host) So, what is the name of that Mexican liquor made from cactus? You really are so funny with all your great stories to tell...  Hostess: (ignoring former classmate) Yeah, but I’m a little slow at packing up today...  Former classmate: That’s ok, we’ll leave without you!    Therefore: Any guests attempting to flatter, lick/lock lips, gaze, flip hair, or invoke excessive,infectious cheer/beckon the undivided attention of either the host or hostess shall be immediately removed from the cafeteria premises.    For extra protection, you should eschew the following discussion which is likely to occur a day or two after you’ve eaten with the former classmate and your uninvited sociology professor:     Host: Well, where is Dr. Sociology today?   Hostess: I’m not sure; I have his class last. I was wondering about Ms. Former Classmate...   Have you seen her today?   Host:  I don’t know where she is.  Hostess: What time is it?  Host: I’m sure Dr. Sociology will show; he’s always right on time!   Finally, as an added security precaution and thereby avoiding any future allegation of “Death eyes,” all luncheons here after will be held at the back table of the secluded  STAFF ONLY  patio—-rain or shine: for all your lunching pleasure, the patio is conveniently and remotely located behind the retractable wall on the cafeteria’s west side.    Remember : The patio Luncheon begins at noon, and relax, don't be shy if you aren't exactly staff; after all, as your host has sugested,"it ought to keep you away from Dr. Sociology..."     Next--Etiquette: the art of flirting
