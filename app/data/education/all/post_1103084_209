words of the day. ............................  he had convinced himself that his increasing  urlLink embonpoint  would be welcomed by the committee when they met again next year.  That they would find such news startling, yes, perhaps, but also heartening.    We must all needs become more substantial at some time or another, musn't we?   We shan't be able to truly make any impact anywhere if we're light enough for a breeze to blow us away.    Speed is one thing.  That is true.  Speed is a virtue that should not be poo-poo-ed by anyone. But ultimately? Really?  It can't be a core virtue.  Can it?  Nor can  change  for that matter.  Right?  Nor  innovation ?  and of course not  revolution ... They're all dependent upon the status quo.  Status quo is the thing.  And what is status quo if its not GIRTH?  If its not substance?  if its not presence?    He looked at himself in the mirror from the side.  Gravitas.  Significance.

None of these could have been possible back when he was his old self.   The self the committee had chosen initially was good for them and good for him then.  When speed was what they needed.  But now they needed something else.  He had convinced himself.  (he nodded in the mirror to affirm that it was all true.  it is all true isn't it?)
