I feel like the world is no more smiling  Back to me….  I hear no birds is singing in the mornings  The sun is hiding from me…  And the stars don’t want to shine again at nights...   I am so heart broken….  Like a glass smashed…shattered into pieces….  I am so heart broken…  Feel like dying and waiting for death to come..  I am so heart broken…  My heart beats so fast like roller coaster…   There’s no inside, inside my broken heart…  There’s only despair, confusion, and tears…..  .
