Changing moods here...I'm a little upset that I just found out before seventh hour that I have to be at Gayle's house at 7 AM to drop off these books to the less fortunate children. Now I'm not blaming anyone at this point, but whomever is responsible for telling us less than 24 hrs. before the event that we have to been there that early in the morning, is going to get a mouthful from me.
