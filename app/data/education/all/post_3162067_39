Another hot sticky day. I seem to spend my whole life in the shower these days. Still, at least the skies are nice and blue. Work was all right today. Nice and contented. What really makes me happy though is that my Doctor has finally referred me to an osteopath to get my back treated, free on the NHS. Oh, and my lovely rotary watch has broken, so I must get that fixed. Quite annoyed about that actually.
