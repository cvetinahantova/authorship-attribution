urlLink Travis Stanley  blogs today about the meaning of (pro)life.  I read the article in  urlLink Sojourners  that he cited a couple of weeks back and it really challenged me to think about my own pro-life stance more deeply especially as it relates to political affiliations.  The Republican Party  does  oppose abortion, but that opposition often comes across as rather shallow; in other words, Republicans don't seem to care about the baby once it leaves the womb.  Furthermore, they seem intent on prosecuting wars all around the world that take the lives of innocents in untold numbers.  The Democrats seem to have the opposite problem: they oppose war but wholeheartedly support abortion.  All this without even mentioning other life-and-death issues (euthanasia, the death penalty, etc.).  At any rate, it looks as though there are now resources for a more comprehensive pro-life ethic.
