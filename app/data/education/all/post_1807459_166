I've managed to make to Vietnam without a snag so that's always a good start.  I arrived yesterday and signed up for two day river/bus tour that will land me in HCMC tomorrow.  Ok where to start.  First of all I already like Vietnam better then Cambodia.  At least this part of Vietnam.  It's not overrun with tourism so people are always trying to take your money and hassel you which is such a big relief.  Yesterday I stayed in a rather small town (can't remember how to spell the name) and had a pretty good time.  I think I ended up sleeping in a     hotel though.  Seemed nice enough at first.  But once I was in the room it occured to me the place was really dirty and run down.  I was only playing $3 so I guess I can't complain too much.  I didn't have to check in or give my name or anything.  I figured this out later too.  There were also a ton of       s in a case in the lobby.  Lucky for me I didn't hear any wierd noises.   On a really cool and interesting note, as I was walking around the city yesterday I walked past a basketball court where some Vietnamese kids were playing some ball.  And sure enough they saw the tall white guy walking by and asked me to join.  And join I did.  It was a ton of fun and my team ended up winning both games I played.  They about ran me to      .  I didn't do as much as I would have liked though.  B/c they were all pretty short there really wasn't much of an inside game going on b/c they had all learned to shoot so well.  On defense after blocking a few shots they all stayed the hell away.  Anyway it was really awesome and a great start to my excursion in Vietnam.   Today I went to my first Mosque.  We visited a minority village on the Me Kong river where they are all Muslim.  I ended up having a pretty full day of boat rides, bus rides, temples, floating villages, and all that jazz.  I'm pretty darn tired but the internet here is only 20 cents a minute so I'll hang out a bit longer.
