With the happenings of summertime fun back in the cowtown I've rather enjoyed the freedom of staying out late,  not having to pay rent & seeing my family more than I did these last few months.  People kept on telling me you'll go crazy being back home because you've grown.  But actually I learned to adapt to my surroundings better since I made the big move to Rancho Cordova (No its not as ghetto as people say).  The only reason I say I am having a moment is because I realize with all the bad stuff that has happened in my world because things have gone the way it has I consider myself to be a very lucky human being.  I never go hungry, I have shelter, clothed most of the time (hehe) and people love me.
