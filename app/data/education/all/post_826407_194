I've been enjoying the new CMS site  urlLink Blah  online.  Its intended to be a community point that is driven by mission.    One of the first articles there was  urlLink A Complex Christ for an Emerging Urban World . by Kester Brewin.  Here's a little quote...   "This is what we celebrate when we break the bread and share the wine: Christï¿½s body, centralised, located physically in one place, is broken and distributed amongst the gathering of believers who then disperse. The elements are internalised, made invisible. The distributed body is thus taken out to infect the community. Unseen. Not controlled by a temple, not dictated by a hierarchy. The network of the Spirit is spreading like yeast through dough. It cannot be pared from the community it lives among, it cannot be singled out and destroyed, branded sacred or secular."      Don't just read my quote though, go look at the whole article!!!   And then maybe buy his book -  urlLink The Complex Christ , it out this month.  Its going on my wish list.
