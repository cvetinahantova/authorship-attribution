So it's summer time.  If I remember correctly, during the school year I was DYING for summer time.  Well I realize now that there is no structure in the summer and all I want is to be in my new classroom setting up things or teaching my new kiddos.    I completed my Exit interview with Carroll ISD, which consisted of me filling out one sheet of paper about where I want my last paychecks sent and when.  It was "thrilling"... and Dr. Citty asked me, "Is there anything else you'd like to say?"  I thought for a second and said, "No."  I realized later that it was true.  There was nothing I wanted to say to the district that cut me due to financial shortfalls and Robin Hood.  All I know is that I did my best and what did that get me?  "Let go."  It's a hash reality to this wacko world.    Needless to say I'm happy about my new job and really wanting to get started.
