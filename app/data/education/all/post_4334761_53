hi daddy. schools started, and as far as i can tell, its going to be a very interesting year. i have to ride two buses (transfer) and it takes like an hour. ive changed alot over the summer and im a very different person than who i used to be. i take walks late @ night because i cant sleep and i love the rain. i listen to mostly rock, and as always, i save jacob from shelby.   love, ellie
