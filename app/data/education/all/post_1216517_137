WHERE HAVE YOU GONE...?  How ashamed I feel for not updating my blog.  It's a travesty, of course.  I've been a busy man though.  I recently finished a screenplay with my good friend Jesse Gloyd.  It's 93 pages, not a small feat, my friend.  We plan to pitch it to director  urlLink Dennis Dugan .  He's our only real Hollywood connection, one of those: 'my friend's roomates' dad is good friends with him' kind of things.  We taylor-wrote it for him.   The script is called "Of Mascots and Men,"  Though that will probably be changed.  I'll elaborate more on the script once we get it registered with the Screenwriters' Guild.  Word.  But things are lining up for this next year.  Next writing project will be for an independant piece that Trevor will direct up in Seattle.  We want to make our way ourselves.  None of us feel up for grad school.  Anyway, the consensus seems to be that if you take your money and invest it in a indie film rather than grad school, it goes to better use.  Trevor's a good director.  I have confidence that we can get the film shown in a few festivals.  I'll try my hand at producing the film (with the other guys).  It's an exciting opportunity.  Met with the  urlLink i.tv  people again.  Trevor had an interview.  They seem to like me, I'm just waiting to see what comes of it.  They way they talk. it's hard not to have delusions of grandeur.  I must say that this has been one of the best end of the year that I've ever had.  Got a car, a job, an apartment.  Trevor came down from Seattle and we hung out.  Drew got married.  I went to 4 parties at the end/begining of the year.  Halfway House Affirmation Night (Tradition among my group of friends where we hike up Tarantula Hill with some Bud and affirm one another), New Year's Eve, Drew's last night in the Bayou (House in Whittier) Party, and Drew's wedding reception.  All these parties were stellar, top-notch.
