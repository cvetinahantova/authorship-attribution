According to an article in today's  urlLink Washington Post , the Bush administration worries that Americans just aren't as scared as they should be.   These people constantly talk about protection and "homeland" security, but when it comes right down to it, this man's re-election is based upon fear, upon convincing people that we need him to protect us from our worst nightmares.    I'm thankful that God calls his children to be "peacemakers" (Matthew 5.9) and to "live in love" (Ephesians 5.2).  One of the NT writers said that "perfect love casts out fear" (1 John 4.18).   I'll take that path; Mssrs. Bush and Cheney can take theirs.
