Austria is wicked! The landscape is so strange, and the way things work over here is slightly wack too! This is where I am sitting at the moment typing the basics of the trip in to my blog and wishing I could remember right now every little detail of the trip.  The current city that I am in is nice but again boring without the history, so I think that if you were yo visit these places, you should probbably go on a contiki, especially because they give you the main reason for the current state of affairs owing to the thick and rich history of each place you go to.
