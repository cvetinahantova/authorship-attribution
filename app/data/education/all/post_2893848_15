Dear Blog Team,  On behalf of all of you, I would like to offer myself a very warm welcome to the blog team!  I have joined the blog team for a variety of reasons which, mostly, are personal and not for you to know.  However at this time, I would like to explain the much debated meaning of the moniker, 'The Granimal.'  I did not choose this name.  This name was chosen for me and recently bestowed upon me by the wisest of the seven-foot Coco's.  That he was able to see into my soul and celebrate my connection to all of creation was really quite astounding.  I had thought my inner animal was well hidden from the rest of you.  In any case, please do not be afraid by the implied hostility in the name 'The Granimal.'  Hostility is a human term and has little meaning for the modern part-man, part-animal.  At this point I would like to thank you all for welcoming me to the blog team and provide you with my most febrile assurances that I will work with harmony and self-control to ensure that the honour of the blog team is at all times reflected in all of my future posts.
