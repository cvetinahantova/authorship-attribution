In case you don't know this about me already, I love movies! Even more so I love going to the movies.  I have gone to 10 movies so far this summer with 6 more on my must see list.  I often go alone and to honest prefer going alone.  It is my escape. I can go into this big, dark room and shut out the rest of the world.  I will see anything because I get lost in movies like people get lost in books.  Every realistic and documentaries are an escape for me.  A movie can help me express emotions that I suppress because of the fear I have of burdening the world with me and my complex bag.   I have been in a funk the last few days, well honestly the last few months. I find it harder and harder to keep the cheery and often optimistic attitude that has become my calling card.  I honestly can sometimes feel myself slipping so I use the movies as a way to run away from my own harsh realities and live in someone else's world for a few hours. There I can be the dashingly handsome man who fights for love without rolling over and surrendering.  The man who dares to live out his wildest dreams. I can be in action packed movie or unrealistic movie where issues of our day to day life do not exist.  In movies, the poor man can succeed, love conquers all and evil is always overpowered by good.
