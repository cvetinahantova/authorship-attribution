You Are a Peppermint Cappuccino  You're fun, outgoing, and you love to try anything new. However, you tend to have strong opinions on what you like. You are a total girly girly at heart - and prefer your coffee with good conversation. You're the type that seems complex to outsiders, but in reality, you are easy to please.   urlLink  What Kind Of Coffee Are You?          Joke of the Day (from Cable Channel 16):  Don't forget that daylight savings time is coming up. If you're at Harding, don't forget to set your clock back 40 years.  Had a panic attack on Saturday, which sucked. I feel like I'm doing a bit much-- three shows, full-time classwork, and the usual housework. But I also feel like I have to do it, because I've got to prove that I can. To myself, to everyone. Whatever.  I need a nap again. I know I say that a lot, but I'm really not sleeping enough. My body is the type that requires about 10 hours to function properly, and I'm barely getting 7 on most nights. I'm so tired it's making me nauseous.  Anyway, things aren't all bad. Financially, we're pretty stable again. We're about to have to blow our state tax refund on new tires though. Plus, the brakes are starting to get squeaky, and Andy swears it's not his fault, but he's the only one who drives the dang thing! :)
