Friday at work   I forgot to mention several things that happened:  1) I skipped class and went straight to work. That ain't a bad thing though, it's not like I missed anything. 2) I installed Debian Linux on one of the new servers. The problem is that the kernel that Debian comes with does not include support for our network cards, so I have to compile and install a new kernel.  3) The other folks from the SAD project group came over and I gave them a quick n' dirty tutorial about basic system administration 4) Philip Tilton came and went on working on the Cisco router (I hate that thing... we put ~$500 into it, and it doesn't work. For that price, it should make me coffee and fetch donuts). Well, Philip got it kind of working... the DNS tables are still f*cked up.
