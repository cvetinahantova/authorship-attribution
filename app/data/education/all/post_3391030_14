Ya today is the 5th as you all know cuz i'm sure it says so! lol but anywayz that means 2 days! 2 more days until i turn 16! 2 more days until i go take my test! 2 more days until i find out if i'll pass or not! wow 2 days can take forever when you really want it to come sooner! argh! anywayz..... ya i asked mom if she could take me out driving today but of course....."i wanna swim!" errrr and she didn't call to see if i needed to bring anything on monday so i dunno what to do... guess i'll just have to call around and see if anyone knows! Summer has being goin along just fine... the time that i went to the lake with my family turned out to be so much more fun than i thought it would be... my aunt kathy brought her bf Ernie! hehe and he is so awesome! he let me drive him up to the store and was kewl about it! but ya he kept me laughin pretty much the whole time cuz i'd pick on him then he'd pick on me... so ya... And my grandpa has really mellowed out alot lol! cuz he was laughin along with me and my sis and let me tell you when i was casey's age (8) he didn't do that with me, but it's ok! i still love him anywayz.... ughhh and if anyone reads this that i handed an invy to plzplzplz tell me if you are comin or not! thanks! anywayz prob should help mom clean or something because then maybe i could talk her into takin me driving! love you all!
