What does that tell you?  Savannah's ammonia is down and she is doing good, so the doc may let her come home this afternoon.   Thanks for all the prayers.  We have lots to do today for the benefit for Savannah tomorrow, cleaning, setting up, chopping, you name it, we get to do it today.  I am praying we will have a fantastic turn out.  Renee and stan really need the money to help with all the bills and stuff.   Its wierd, when something like this comes up, the stress makes the mind blow things out of proportion, makes you hear things that people don't really say, and keeps you really on edge.  I have been praying every day for God to keep me steady for Renee.  I know that right now she needs support, not to deal with other people's problems.  So I am trying to be as supportive as possible.  I have no clue if I am doing a good job or not, all I know is I am trying to be the best friend I can be for her.   She is under unimaginable stress.  I mean her daughter is getting ready to have a liver transplant.  She is trying her best to raise money so they can actually live and pay their bills while having to stay away from home, eating take out for all meals, stan missing so many days unpaid at work, I know she is bound to be all tied up in side.   Not to mention trying to keep Savannah away from al the nasty germs to keep her as healthy as possible for the transplant.  And now, she is in the hospital because her MMR shot reacted on her.   I mean things like this, you can't plan for, you can only roll with the flow, and still try to stay sane.  Try to keep composed, and do what is best for your family.   Then you bring up the fact that it is time for school to start, reenrolling EJ in public school, adn having to get him settled, in the right classes, and helping him readjust to life in public school.  How much can a mom take?  I wish I could take some of the pressure off her, but I can't.  She has got to be the strongest person I know.
