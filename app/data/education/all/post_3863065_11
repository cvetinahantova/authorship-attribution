So this is what my boss said - An English teacher...AND Owner of the English School!  Can you figure out what he is trying to say?!!   So today's events included waking up at 8:00AM so I could be at my 1 hour class of the day at 10AM... which of course since it is not the regular time my Student's FORGOT, that ended up being a 30minute class.  Went looking for a place to visit on the weekend and got lost!  Finally about after 15minutes made it back out to the main road and then proceeded to GUESS which way it might be!!  Well I guessed right cause I finally found it!  Beautiful drive too!  Will definitely have to take my camera this weekend when I go!   Am teaching 2:30-5:00 tomorrow!  New class for me, just this once.  Since one of the other teachers has already started HIS vacation, I have to have that class.  I actually teach these kids on Tuesday Morning for the kindergarten classes, but not individually, so I am hoping they are the good kids, not the bad ones!!  :)   Answer to 'Extra Special Hot'  IS  ' Especially Hot This Summer'!!   :-D
