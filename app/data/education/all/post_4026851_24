aka "Cook prep instructions,  urlLink Escher-style "  My lunch today was the new "Lasagna with Meat Sauce" entree from the masters of the frozen dinner--  urlLink Boston Market . The people that write the packaging lit these days have their asses covered to the tenth power.   Microwave Oven:   The following cook preparation was developed using a 1000 watt microwave oven. Due to variations in all ovens, adjustment to cooking time may be required.   1. Remove tray from outer carton; pull back corner of film to vent.   2. Cook on HIGH for 6 minutes.   3. Let stand in microwave for 1-2 minutes. Enjoy.     Imagine the phone calls...  Disgruntled customer: "Hello? Customer service? I am very disappointed with your new Boston Market lasagna meal." Customer service: "Did you follow the instructions carefully?" DC: "Uh... yeah." CS: "Are you sure?" DC: "Positive. The lasagna sucked balls." CS: "Sir, step three clearly states that you are to 'enjoy.' If I am correctly assuming that "sucking balls" means that you did not, in fact, 'enjoy' your dining experience, then you have failed to follow the preparation instructions carefully." DC: "So... If I'm understanding you here... it's my own damn fault that your lasagna sucks balls." CS: "Precisely. Thank you and have a nice day." DC: "Fuck!"
