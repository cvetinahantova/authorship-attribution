urlLink UTS_Library - Australian Information Literacy Standards  These are a few years old now but here are the information literacy standards being used by Australian librarians.  From the Site:   Australian Information Literacy Standards   In October 2000, the Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) adopted seven standards for Information Literacy in Australia.  Complete Australian Information Literacy Standards documentation is available from CAUL.  According to these standards, the information literate person:  recognises the need for information and determines the nature and extent of the information needed  accesses needed information effectively and efficiently  evaluates information and its sources critically and incorporates selected information into their knowledge base and value system  classifies, stores, manipulates and redrafts information collected or generated  expands, reframes or creates new knowledge by integrating prior knowledge and new understandings individually or as a member of a group  understands cultural, economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses and uses information ethically, legally and respectfully  recognises that lifelong learning and participative citizenship requires information literacy  These Australian Information Literacy Standards are derived from the United States Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, which were approved by the Association of College and Research Libraries in January 2000.
