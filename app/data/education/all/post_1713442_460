urlLink Setting the Agenda: American Indian and Alaska Native Education Research Priorities. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Strang, William, von Glatz, Adrienne, and Hammer, Patricia Cahape.  It postulates ideas for what research should be done in Indian education.  From the ERIC Digest:  This Digest briefly reviews the events that led to the development of the "American Indian and Alaska Native Education Research Agenda" (2001), the basic assumptions and premises underlying it, and the priority research topics it ultimately included, organized within six topic areas. Begun in 1998 under the Clinton administration, the Research Agenda was approved and released during the first year of the Bush administration. Currently it provides a touchstone, guiding a national effort to produce high-quality research focused on effective education practices and ways to implement them in schools and programs serving American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students.
