Anyone.  Did anyone make the transition to my new blog?  I miss my readers.  *sigh*  I can share a story about a mean evil mother, her sweet innocent daughter and the fight that occurred between them.  Seriously, I actually have a physical wound from her.  My first ever.  It pissed me off to no end.  I swear sometimes.......  I better not finish that sentence.  Anyway, Tonight is also the second installment of my current favorite show, the  urlLink Amazing Race 5 .  So pathetically into that show that I actually get excited when I talk about it.  I really think that I need to get a new form of life, but really, WHY?  This one is so simple and predictable, yet full of excitement at times (I   did   say that my mom caused me a physical wound after all).  Apparently, today at 12:30 pt/3:30 et you can "Chat Live with Host Phil Keoghan"  Special.  I might be into the show, but certainly not that much.......yet.  Anyway, to my current readers. Thank you for remaining.  I hope to build a new following soon.  Hah! I'm so full of ... something.
