Still.  I am  still  alive. I  still  want to continue wanting.  Still. 'Be  still  and know that I am God'.   Still ness knocks your breath out  from your frail lungs Suffocates your brains Tears the oxygen from your eyeballs Enters into the dark corners of your heart And gnaws away endlessly Till you cringe in invisible pain Your nails cutting into your cold damp palms Tainted with puddles of salted tears  It is not enough.  Still. 'Be  still  and know that I am God'.
