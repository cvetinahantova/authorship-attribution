oops, said the entire message in the title. anywhoozles. will finish earlier entry later       for now:  I'm passed out on the overpass  Sunday best and broken glass  Broken down from the bikes and bars  Suspended like spirits over speeding cars  You and me were kings over the parkway tonight  And tonight will go on forever while we  Walk around this town like we own the streets  And stay awake through summer like we own the heat  We're singing   Everybody wake up  (Wake up)  It's time to get down.  (Everybody Everybody wake up, it's time to get down)  And when I pass the bottle back to Pete  on the overpass tonight, I bet we laugh   I'm gonna stay eighteen forever  (Cut me open)  So we can stay like this forever  (Sun poisoned)  And we'll never miss a party  'Cause we keep them going constantly  (This offer stands forever)  And we'll never have to listen  (New haircut)  To anyone about anything  (New bracelet)  'Cause it's all been done and it's all been said  (Eyeliner)  We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get  (Wait forever)   The hell out of this town  And find some conversation  The low fuel lights been on for days  It doesn't mean anyhting  I've got another 500  'nother 500 miles  Before we shut this engine down  (We shut it down)   I'm gonna stay eighteen forever  (Cut me open)  So we can stay like this forever  (Sun poisoned)  And we'll never miss a party  'Cause we keep them going constantly  (This offer stands forever)  And we'll never have to listen  (New haircut)  To anyone about anything  (New bracelet)  'Cause it's all been done and it's all been said  (Eyeliner)  We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get  (Wait forever)   (You're just jealous cause we're young and in love)  Eighteen forever  (Your stomachs filled up but you're starved for conversation)  So we can stay like this forever  (You're spending all your nights growing old in your bed)  And we'll never miss a party  (And your tearin up your photos 'cause you wanna forget... it's over)  'Cause we keep them going constantly   (You're just jealous cause we're young and in love)  And we'll never have to listen  (Your stomachs filled up but you're starved for conversation)  To anyone about anything  'Cause it's all been done  (You're spending all your nights growing old in your bed)  And it's all been said  (And your tearin' up your photos cause you wanna forget... it's over)  And we're the coolest kids and we take what we can get  Just jealous cause we're young and in love  Just jealous cause we're young and in love  Just jealous cause we're young and in love  Just jealous cause we're young and in love  Just jealous cause we're young and (turntable scratch)        the rest of my life is a long time to pretend ya, so goodbye to all of that stuff      sorry.
