hello,  well another day at school.  this one has been extremely slow, but the good news is that i got my new schedule this week.  i'll be teaching many more classes from now on,but since i'm just splitting other people's classes i don't have to do much of the paper work.  yeah!  i'll also be tutoring during part of lunch break, but apparently it is optional for the students and most teachers who have done it before say they usually don't show up.   anyway... i guess i'll just have to see.  nothing else to tell really.  i substituted for 1st grade this morning.  they were so cute but hard to understand because they only speek basic english.  i've got to learn to slow down when i talk to them.  other than that it went great.  some of the kids are extremely shy, but if you make it fun they will participate more.  i've almost got my work wardrobe complete.  i just need one more skirt and another shirt.  hasn't beeen as hard as it seemed at first.  love ya, jane  ps i'm joining a faculty basketball team next week.  yeah!!!  i'm excited to be on the court again.
