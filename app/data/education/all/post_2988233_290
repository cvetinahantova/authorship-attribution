I told you I would be better today.  I am keeping Savannah and EJ today.    Savannah is the punkiest I have seen her in a long time.  We have already had a tea party, played outside, watch Wiggles, Barney, part of Dora and part of Blues clues.  She is played with Noah and drove him nuts.  ALready managed to make TJ mad.  And its not even noon yet.  She is a wild child on a roll.  I love it when she is like this.  Drives the boys crazy, I just sit back and laugh.
