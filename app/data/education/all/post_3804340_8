TVB has launched a new paid TV channel. The promotion staff knocked the door. Here was the situation:     Outside the gate: The promoters blah blah blah  The other side of the gate: Karina in pajamas+ dinner was ready+ my dad was murmuring       I then told them to come back in 30 mins as I have to discuss with my family. They really did come back. After I have told them we were not interested, she told me that I could make the decision if I really wanted to join. Though I am not interested either, the whole stuff puts me into a deeper thought.      Well, it maybe too much to use the word 'boss'. Why should I waste the time to tell them that 'We have to discuss it first before we decide'? I am the one who paid the bill literally and I know they don't want to join, why didn't I turn them down at the very beginning? Don't know how to say no? That's the very first thought.     After I have thought about the whole stuff while I was watching  urlLink 'Queer eyes for the straight guy' , I asked myself 'Was I that coward to turn them down?' Maybe at the very first moment, Yes. Then I realized it's my usual practice. Whenever wherever whatever (Pick one) it comes to my family, I don't/dare not/can't/am not allowed (just pick one again) to decide by my own will. It was OK when I was a kid; it sounds weird when I began to grow up. I don't wanna mention the long story of what I have been through. It did create some bad influences to my character. I am so used to give excuses or say no, whenever stuff touches the borderline of 'family'.     That's really something I have to work on.
