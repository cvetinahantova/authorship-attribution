so only 4 of us showed up for algebra today... given it's our earliest class (9:50) so it's a stretch for people to be up then, and given the prof. doesn't give the most coherent lectures so people seem to take turns skipping class, but this was definitely a record low... usual attendance is around 10 people even though it's a class of 15 or so... 4 was just plain miserable.  we went over our evil midterms from a couple weeks ago... it makes low grades look so much nicer when they're only out of 4 points instead of out of 100.... all grades were basically 2.5, 2.75, or 3 out of 4... not the best, but all pretty close too.... he decided to go over related problems to the test the whole time... at one point he asked a question and said my name in particular... i had no idea so i gave him a blank stare until he moved on and answered it himself... i'm such a bad student. =P  no graph theory today... prof. kahn is off doing who knows what... subway when eric gets out of number theory, then homework forever, as usual.  later dudes.
