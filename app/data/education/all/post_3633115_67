I have such an awesome spouse.  He let me watch TV  urlLink (the Amazing Race 5) , while he did the dishes, got Shorty ready for bed, and did some laundry. He really is awesome!  I just have to comment about how great he his and how much I appreciate him.  Don't worry, I told him how much I appreciate him and how awesomely fabulous he is already.  But just in case he needs it in writing.......  S, you are the most awesomely fantastic man in the world. I love you.  Awwww...professions of love that make others want to vomit.  Is there anything more special?
