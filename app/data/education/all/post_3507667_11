8 months ago, I bought a Black Lab puppy, and the girls named her Winter. I know, Black Lab and the first name that pops into their strange little minds is the season of white. This puppy is the most gentle, timid, and playful dog I've ever had the pleasure of owning. She has rapidly become a welcomed part of our family.  Now being the good owner that I am I enjoy taking my puppy out for walks on the nature trail, I let her go and she tears around the woods and sometimes even jumps into the river for a swim. She listens well for a hyper-active dog and very gentle when strangers approach to pet her or introduce there own dogs to her.      Soooo. Yesterday night after getting home from work and very tired I took  Winter out for our walk. We were halfway down the trail when a little chipmunk darted onto the trail. Being the brave doggy that she is, she tore off after it into the woods. Thinking poor chipmunk probably scared half to death I started to call the dog back, when I hear something running like hell through the woods towards me. Winter comes bursting out of the woods with this tiny chipmunk close on her heels. She looked at me as she streaked past with pleading eyes as if to say, "Oh crap, it's the bionic chipmunk", and then she was off again. It took a good 5 minutes before she came back onto the trail, out of breath and full of branches and leaves. I know that she's upset with me now because I laughed at her for a goodly period of time before being able to continue our little walk. I can't wait to take her back out later tonight to see if that possessed chipmunk is waiting for her.
