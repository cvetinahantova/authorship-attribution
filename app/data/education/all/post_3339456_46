Here is an  urlLink excellent article  by former CIA analyst Ray McGovern.  He empathizes with an anonymous former CIA analyst, "Mike," who has gone public with his criticisms of the Bush gang.  Here is an excerpt:   "It's not hatred of us as a society, it's hatred of our policies," Mike insisted.Â  He gave pride of place to the neuralgic issue of Israel.Â  With candor not often heard on American television, he emphasized "It's very hard in this country to debate policy regarding Israel," adding that bin Laden's "genius" is his ability to exploit those U.S. policies most offensive to Muslims – "Our support for Israel, our presence on the Arabian peninsula, in Afghanistan and Iraq, our support for governments that Muslims believe oppress Muslims."   Furthermore,    Here is where Mike's understated outrage shows through most clearly.Â  The undercurrent in both interviews is that his analysis was offered well before the war but, as he told NBC, "senior bureaucrats in the intelligence community (were unwilling) to take the full truth, an unvarnished truth to the president...Whatever danger was posed by Saddam...was almost irrelevant...the boost that (the war) would give to Al Qaeda was easily seen."
