I haven't been sleeping well again. Yesterday I tried to tire myself out by doing the Richard Curtis RomCom Walk of Whimsy (patent pending) along Bankside then wandering around the Tate Modern for several hours, but come nightfall I was still wound up and angsty  and suffering from substandard spinal support.*  The result of this is that I slept until about 1.30pm today and have achieved nothing. Ah well.  I have two days of induction at New Job starting tomorrow. Oh no. I don't mind the meetings and tours and so on, but I find the sinister two hours of 'personal planning time' on the timetable somewhat alarming. I suspect this will require me to hang about in the art department getting under everyone's feet and feeling stupid. Is there anything more cringe-inducing than starting a new job?   In other news, I was trying to find a link to the Barclay's ad when I found out that Gary Oldman is from New Cross. I don't know what to do with this information, but I feel it could be Important in some cosmic way.  We are having baked potatoes for tea.  * I genuinely think my head is too heavy for conventional pillows. The boy regularly buys me new and exotic varieties of pillow but within a fortnight they're flat as pancakes again. Does anyone else have a really heavy head? Just me then.
