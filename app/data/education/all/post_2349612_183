i've decided that if dr. woodward feels no obligation to present his lectures clearly (several times per class he stops and gets confused and finds errors and re-does everything), i have no obligation to turn in clearly written homework.  i wrote up 6 sheets (front and back) of half solutions to homework for him that's due tomorrow and i don't care anymore... it's done.  tomorrow's a new day... to start on non- lie groups homework... joy.  (fun) reading, then to sleep.
