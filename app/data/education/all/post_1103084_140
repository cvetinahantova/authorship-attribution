......... oops. .........  i've got a three post running cycle of one word title postings.   remember how i liked the idea that i was frozen in a kind of long-term ugh....  while i was driving (far from connectibility) and opening presents and hanging with the fam -- I decided that I *didn't* like being frozen in a long term "ouch".  I still love _Blankets_ and i still feel scarred by fundamentalism -- but the idea of being in a position of "genuine" emotional pain for however-many-days-that-post-has-topped-my-blog seems embarrassing to me.   like i'm a guy who's just constantly "put upon by the the world, and nobody 'gets' him..." to quote a favorite movie (_the good girl_) from this year...  and again my meta-analytical thinking is about the nature of speech in different mediums.  The way that writing / text / archives FREEZE the different inflections and gestures and poses that together compose our wholeness...feels a bit dangerous.  Because if the wrong inflection gets frozen for too long, then it becomes the definitive one.   But aren't we always doing that as we think about our relationships with people?  They become more and less of this or that as we think about them more in terms of their THIS and less in terms of their THAT.  Anyone else exhausted by holiday cheer? spreading Christmas across days and miles and families takes so much intention...  tonight should be fun -- we're following family tradition -- for the third year in a row -- traipsing off to see Return of the King -- I'm excited...haven't been this excited for a movie since the anticipation of schoolhouse rock (love R. Linklater + love M. White= will overlook J. Black).  I'm officially disappointed by the movie (upon consideration, Ryan & Josh, if you're reading)....tho' I think its a fine rental for anyone who wants an entertaining movie....Just not what I'd expect from a collaboration between Linklater and White....  peace~
