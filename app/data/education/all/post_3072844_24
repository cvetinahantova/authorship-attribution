I Wish   I wish i was a crocodile Keeping everyone on their toes, I wish i was an elephant With a HUMUNGUS nose, I wish i had some bright red shoes That could fly me to the moon, I wish that i could, with my mind, Bend a metal spoon, I wish i had a magic wand To summon what i need, I wish i had a frying pan To get rid of that Lee Creed, I wish my bed was really soft Like fluffy cotton wool, I wish my glass of lemonade Was always always full, I wish i was a cheetah And could beat Tim in a race, I wish i could make card castles And NOT put in the ace, I wish my roof was made of glass So i could see the stars, I wish they'd hurry and find a way So we could move to Mars, I wish that all our money Was made of chocolate wrapped in foil, I wish i was a snake And i could wind into a coil, But MOST OF ALL I wish that i, Before the end of today, Could get all of my work done, As it's THEN that i can play!  by Charlie Fothergill (me!)     ...little flash of inspiration there!
