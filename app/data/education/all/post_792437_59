Isn't there such a thing as THINK before you speak???    Â  MMmm...I'm mad! Why the heck do people say stuff, and then regret saying it. HECK, why don't you use your HEAD????????? I hate it! I mean, if you wanna say something and you are wondering about it, don't just say it cause you think you'll be "COOL", and then realize 2 months later..oops I shouldn't have said that..let me go back and ERASE that from the past.....WEIRD!
