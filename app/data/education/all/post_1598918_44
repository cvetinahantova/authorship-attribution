The Robot We Need   Now this is a robot I think I could use.  Its completely useless--just friendly, funny, agile and inexpensive. Check out this news article from the New Zealand Herald.   urlLink New Zealand News - Technology - Serious fun with wobbling friend : "The Robosapien is very friendly, in an international, non-communicative kind of way. With no obvious branding, and no language skills to speak of, it belches and whistles, chatters away and bumbles along. "     The article says $180 but I think that's New Zealand dollars.  I found it for just under $95.   urlLink MegaMacs.com - Your source for Mega Mac Deals : "At 14 inches high, Robosapien is a rambunctious, realistic, recreational robot who is easily programmed and mastered with a remote control.
