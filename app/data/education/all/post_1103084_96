i haven't traditionally been all about posting links up here -- but i ran across this one this morning -- and it uses different language and theory than i'm used to, but it gets at a whole group of issues i've been thinking about -- and in a way that is appealing to me.    urlLink "policemen & shepherds"  deals with questions like "who is the church?" -- "who isn't the church?" -- and -- "what should the church's role in deciding who's in / who's out be?"  lynn and i are in a sunday school class going through the heidelberg  catechism and this week we did sacraments --   the whole idea that the church -- any church -- should be about policing the sacraments -- deciding who does and doesn't partake, who can and can't, who should and shouldn't -- in general, seems abhorent to me....  did you see  urlLink daniels' send up  of my most recent posting?  its funny.
