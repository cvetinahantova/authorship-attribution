Omg, my sergury is tomorrow! I really wasn't that scared until last night when my mom told me that i needed someone to come and sit with me on Friday while she went to work for two hours. Then i'm like, "Well, i think i will be okay" and then she said, "Well just incase if your sick or something, which you probably will be, you should have someone here with you" So, yea whatever I am SCARED!!!    Oh and kellie is coming home today!
