hey all,  well it's official.  i'm a fruit.  i can't believe how wonderful all of the fruit is over here.  i like everything i've tried.  i'm on to durian next.  i'm not sure if that is how you spell it, but anyway... it's stinky.  hey i'll try anything once.  i think the only thing i've eaten here that i did not like was a tamarind (again spelling ?)  it tastes similar to a raisin.  well not much to say today.  i went to brunch at kuppa's in sukhumvit.  which is only yards from molly's place.  it was nice to be in that area again.  we bummed around at an art gallery for a while and then went shopping.  i'm slowly collecting a wardrobe.  things are cheap here but i have to force myself to think in baht instead of dollars since that's what i'm being paid in.  ohhh!!!! payday is soon.  i'm going to open a bank account here so it will be easier to put myself on a budget.  well gotta run.  i hope everyone is doing fine.  jane
