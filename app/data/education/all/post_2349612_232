lara = happiest proud new didgeridoo owner in the world  recall eric has a didgeridoo i like to play with that a friend of his made... after much discussion (eric talks to me, then eric talks to his friend) over the past 8 months, a month ago i sent a check to cover postage and give the guy some money for handmaking the thing, and it (my new handcarved by eric's MN friend didgeridoo) came in the mail today -- i'm ecstatic! =)
