Jeez, only a week left on AWARE. I really don't get that. . . how can the game end before the bomb is set to go off? Well, I guess I'll just have to wait and see.  The silver lining to that is that it will end before I'll have to go back to school.  Speaking of . . . I got my schedule a little while ago. I got all the classes I asked for, which is good. I still have to finish my math packet. . . darn it.  And I thought I would have my book done by the end of the summer. I don't think I've written anything in two weeks. I think I need to just write it down and get it down before I start fixing  anything . What I plan on doing is writing the last chapter now, I have some really good words in my head for it. One problem I'm having is trying to make is as far away from Alias as  possible . I've already gotten enought ideas from them, I think it's time I got my own.  Well, I'm off to do that now.
