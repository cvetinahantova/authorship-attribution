You have a twisted soul! Twisted Souls are never bad, and actually, are a rarity amongst souls. These souls are a little combination of everything, with always a little of their own chaos to add. Twisted Souls are kind, loving, weird, zany, temperamental, and very talented. They have their own firm opinion, and can at one time be very outspoken and passionate, and the other time shy and feeling insignificant. Twisted Souls have good senses of Humor and other times can be a bore. You can act quite intelligent at one time, and grasp concepts easily, while other times they can find it difficult to understand. Twisted Souls are always very fun and Kind, and can be party animals. But, if you love someone, you're serious about it, intense, and forever loyal. Congratulations-- the world should have more like you.   urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

Monday was rough-- comprehensive finals in Shakespeare and Contemporary Drama, and a big final in Christian Home. Thankfully, my grades are high enough this semester that I can bomb the finals and still pass. Good thing, because in that Chriatian Home final, I could only remember enough to answer 86 out of 100 questions. Not bad, but not great. Oh, the dangers of cramming all night for three tests.  Today was easier. We had a 38-question test for Vocal Performance, which I finished in 20 minutes. I came into class and presented Miller with a disk containing a Power Point presentation on the Bernoulli Effect, since he took forever to explain it to us, including his cheesy drawings. :)  Tomorrow, we meet at Midnight Oil (the coffee house just off-campus) to present our production binders, then I have Thursday off. Friday, we meet again at Midnight Oil, we all get coffee, then we go take the Theatre History test at 9.  Then three weeks off, then school again! The fun never stops.
