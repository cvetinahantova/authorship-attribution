Went to look at some of the ART Sheffield festival a while back, it was a citywide festival of contemporary art.  There was some really good stuff displayed in different venues around the city.  One piece I found particularly gripping.  It was called �Black Thread� and (I think) looked at the impact of violence.  It was displayed in a large post-industrial warehouse.  The room was dark and we were immediately disorientated coming from a bright sunny day into a pitch-black cavern.  A continuous thumping noise added to the feeling of confusion and suspense.  The combination of the dark and this ominous noise was very powerful and played on fears of unknown terror and violence very well.  Eventually we plucked up courage and walked into the hanger.  As our eyes adjusted to the (lack of) light we saw on a video screen in the middle of the room a round wrapped object being smacked again and again.  The whole thing was very unsettling but prompted an almost cathartic response.  Powerful.  This was the weekend that Fridge was up to stay.  It was great to spend time with you,  Hope you enjoyed it.
