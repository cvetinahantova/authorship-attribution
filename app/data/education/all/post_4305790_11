I read an article in Strait Times a few days ago, it was about Hong Kong being hit by smog from southern China. The situation was tremendeously bad, forcing the pedestrians to wear masks or to held their hands over their noses in futile attempts to stop breathing in particulates. This is just another issue of air pollution striking the globe once again. How bad could pollutions be? Obviously, polluted air creates discomfort to the communnity and it basically ruins the fresh air we as people have the right to breathe upon. This is basic knowledge. However, as my reading of the article progresses, I begin to understand how the issue of pollution is not just nesting around discomfortness, there is more to it.  Extreme pollution, especially caused by smog and wind, leads to haze...and worse comes to worse, due to this "invisibility" occuring in HK, a catamaran carrying more than 120 passengers collided with an oil barge. The air pollution index ranges from 70-134, where a scale of 100 was considered high already. Hong Kong's pollution is lying on the extreme end. A number of factors contribute to this bad air phenomenon. Across the border, the number of factories and power plants are increasing each year. Car ownership is intensifying, although liquified petroleum gas has been encouraged. In Hong Kong itself, the territory's largest power supplier, CLP Power, is generating energy for sale to the power-starved mainland. At the same time, it is shifting towards greater use of coal.  Pollution is a social distress, yet people all over the world can't stop its expansion and massive destruction. I want to highlight that pollution is a very serious issue, putting the entire mass of the globe at stake.
