For those of you who may be wondering, yes thats right there has been a distinct lack of sex recently. No mention of it, means that I haven't had any thoughts or actions in that area.  Why?  Well it may seem like a strange concept to those looking in on the life of a married man, but Angela has been on holiday and any previous thoughts or needs I have had to just get my end away with the woman lying next to me have gone.  Don't ask me why, it all seems to be subconcious. I could say the reason I think it's happening like this, but the mention of the word or words would be unfair and sometimes is just plain scary. I also want to be really sure of myself.
