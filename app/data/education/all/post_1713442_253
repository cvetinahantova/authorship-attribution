urlLink Delivering Course Materials to Distance Learners over the World Wide Web: Statistical Data Summary    This full-text article is from the Journal of Library Services for Distance Education. (Vol. 1 Issue 2, June 1998).  It summarizes the data collected from a year-long library study, conducted at the University at Buffalo, on developing and implementing a web-based support service for distance learning.  From the introduction:  In 1996, the State University of New York (SUNY) Office of Educational Technology (OET) awarded the libraries at SUNY Buffalo, Binghamton, and Plattsburgh an $85,000 grant to conduct a year-long study of the feasibility of delivering library and other resources over the Internet to students in distance education programs. One of the goals of the project, addressed in this article, was to determine the technical requirements for developing and operating a Web-based distance learning support service. A variety of project data was collected to determine such matters as the optimal scanning equipment for this type of work and the optimal file formats, in terms of both efficiency and accessibility. This article summarizes the data that was collected over the course of two semesters at the University at Buffalo (UB). Another goal of the project was to determine if the Internet was the most effective means of delivering instructional materials to students for the purpose of distance learning.
