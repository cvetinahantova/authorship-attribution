Some days you wake up and just know that things are going to get better, but it starts with a concerted effort.  Mine started with a bit of reading and as I opened the book The Path by J. Donald Walters the chapter I left off on started with a discussion of what failure means.  Failure is merely stepping stones on the path to success.  I found this passage deeply inspirational and was glad that I made the effort to open that book this morning.  I will take the time today to thank God for giving me gifts of inspiration and joy.  I will commit myself again to immersion in the light of the eternal.  I wll employ all the means necessary to live in the light, freeing myself with every step from the darkness that can so easily surround me.  Nothing on earth can hold me / Rise oh my sould in freedom / Nothing to fear anymore...so long as I place my trust fully in the love of God asking that all the great Masters, Saints and Sages of all the ages direct me in my course.  This I have done today and will do tomorrow and so long as I follow this path I can truly find freedom.
