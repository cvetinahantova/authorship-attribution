I had been thinking about it for some while, but the  urlLink recent article  on bOING bOING pretty much set my mind to it. There is something missing in bayesian filters, and that is a way to tag certain words as filter-unworthy. For example, if a mailing list gets spammed, certain words, such as the mailing list name and address, should not be trusted... but that doesn't mean that any other e-mail on that list should be tagged as spam, when the proportion is perhaps one in 5000. So there would be two ways to solve this - to put more weight on all the spam-related words, or to reduce the weight on the unreliable words. Hmm... perhaps that would warrant a little project.
