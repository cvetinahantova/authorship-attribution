Today was a good day.  Okay, it was a great day.  I took today off and it felt so good to sleep in, catch up on things around the apartment, get a clean review from the dentist, make some good food, and just lay low.  Its back to the office tomorrow though. I'm gonna bust my tail and hope I can get enough done to have this coming weekend off.    I've been on this weird AM radio kick lately.  It just seems like there are no good call in shows anymore on FM, and that local talk radio is dying for the most part.  I was listening to a show where people would call in with the best life lessons they have. One of the least profound was that some guy called up and said his was "Always keep your beer cold".    I did go to the track today!  Tony wants me to do a bit at a time to build strength and test my tendon to see how it feels.  Track, watch out!  You are going down!
