EXTRA EFFORT By DARREN HARBAUGH Valley Press Staff Writer LANCASTER ��Kyle Nichols� bloop single in the bottom of the 12th inning gave the JetHawks an 11-10 victory over the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes on Thursday at the Hangar. The JetHawks blew an 8-1 lead in a game that was wild from the start.  In the first inning, Dan Uggla slammed a 400-foot solo home run to left center. It was his 21st of the season to tie teammate Kyle Nichols for the Cal League lead. In the third, Jones dropped a single into right field. Then, not to be outdone by Uggla, Kyle Nichols lined a shot down the right-field line that barely cleared the top of the fence to reclaim the Cal League home run lead. Jay Garthwaite doubled, Edgar Varela singled and Danny Richar�s squeeze bunt scored Garthwaite. Mike DiRosa plunked a single into left to score Varela and make it 5-0. In the fourth, Rancho Cucamonga cleanup hitter and Anaheim Angels prospect Dallas McPherson lined a double to center field driving in Jeff Mathis making it 5-1.  The heavy hitters provided power early, but the most impressive JetHawk display came from an unlikely source. In the fifth inning, Mike DiRosa smashed a 420-foot, three-run blast over the centerfield fence. It was only his third home run of the season and first since April. It gave the JetHawks a seemingly solid 8-1 lead entering the sixth inning. In the sixth, McPherson, who is hitting .530 (26-49) with 11 homers in his last 17 games, launched a massive shot over the the right-field scoreboard. The two-run shot brought the Quakes within 8-4. Jaime Jones got into the act by knocking a solo home run, his 12th, in the bottom of the sixth to increase the lead to 9-4. After getting two quick outs in the seventh, JetHawks pitcher Reuben Kerbs walked four consecutive batters. His walk of McPherson scored a run, making it 9-5. Reliever Billy Biggs was brought in to face Nick Gorneault. Gorneault has feasted on JetHawk pitching this series, crushing three home runs and driving in 14 runs. Biggs� first pitch to Nick Gorneault was sent sailing over Garthwaite�s leap in left field for a grand slam. It was Gorneault�s 14th home run of the season and it tied the game at 9-9. JetHawks reliever Pete Sikaras tamed the heart of the Quakes� batting order in the top of the ninth, striking out Mathis, McPherson, and Gorneault. In the 10th, Sikaras kept overwhelming batters, striking out two more Quakes. Unfortunately for the JetHawks, Sikaras couldn�t pitch forever. Cliff McMachen was brought in for the 11th. And with two outs, Jason Aspito knocked a home run to right- center field to give the Quakes a 10-9 lead. In the bottom of the 11th, JetHawks got a leadoff double from Jamie Jones. Rancho got two quick outs. Then Edgar Varela got a hit to right field. Jones sprinted home. Right fielder Aspito fired the ball to catcher Jeff Mathis. But the throw was off line and Jones scored on a collison with Mathis at the plate, tying the game at 10. Next up, Jason Gorman singled and Varela advanced to third. But Danny Richar flied out to the shortstop to end the JetHawks threat. In the bottom of the 12th, DiRosa wild throw. Then Marland Williams laid down a bunt. Both men were safe. With runners on first and second, Uggla laid down a sacrifice bunt and moved the runners over. The Quakes intentionally walked Jones to load the bases for a try at a double play. But Nichols stepped to the plate and blooped a pitch into shallow left center for a JetHawk victory.
