I am working on my research paper....In carrying out this task, time management plays a great role.I really need time to read... In searching of answers to a research question, I must read critically, meaning I have to process the information as well as assessing what I read.          With research questions in my mind, I seek the truth...How am I to seek the truth ?   Questioning poet's expertise?  Looking for possible flaws in the poet's reasoning?  Weighing the evidence?          Sometimes, I facing problems with the internet sources.Is all clues that are provided in the articles are worth tracking down?. Some of them provide abstracts or brief summaries which I need to question myself in tracking down a source.Some of the questions are; How relevant are they to my research?  How long is the source? A very short article may be too general to be helpful...   How valid are they?          Right now, I Have tracked down some sources, now is the time to make a preview....  How hectic it is.....
