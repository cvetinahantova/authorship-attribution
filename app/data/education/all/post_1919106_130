Musical discoveries   Well for starters I found a pretty decent  urlLink radio station . They play a lot of the music I like, and a lot of the bands I know. And some that I don't, but are great nevertheless, like  Missa Mercuria  and  urlLink The Gathering . I predict that I'm really going to like this station.
