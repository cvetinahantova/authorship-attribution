Hey mom.. you inspire me so much. I know I get mad at you a lot and I'm hard to deal with but I think this whole thing you have put together with the help of those other ladies is really really great. Suprisingly I had a fun time running out there although it was scorching hot... yay I ran the farthest I've ever ran in my life..!! I would have never been able to do it though if you werent there behind me encouraging me acknowledging me for taking this on. Yes I've had to make lot of sacrafices to do this but I think it will all be worth it in the end. I LOVE YOU! I think im the only person my age who runs in there spare time. BUT I WILL BE DIFFERENT!! I wrote this on here because i know it would mean more to you if im not embarrased to shout it out loud! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously..  thankyou so much for all that you have given me. the support, the advice, you are all that I could wish for in a mother and more. You truly are my inspiration and role model. See you soon.      Your daughter  Tara         p.s. just look at this when we are in a fight okay? And then you wont get as mad cause you will know that I care about you even though I want to stay as far away from you as possible at the time.
