Despite their propensity for cleanliness, pigs, Ilya decided, were just plain nasty.  It never failed that her turn for cleaning the pens came during the hottest parts of the summer.  The sodden muck of the pens stuck to her boots, the pigs, greatful for company, rubbed against her legs which were usually clad in a pair of one of her older brother's cast-off breeches (her mother hated seeing her in boy's clothing, but had given up trying to prevent it), and the flies buzzed and bit unmercifully through the damp tangle of hair at her neck and ears.      Summer in __________ was usually a very pleasant time.  The fields ripened and turned green and golden under a bright azure sky.  Children played in the fields, swam in the streams and ponds, and climbed trees in the forest.  Wives tended kitchen gardens, looked after the little ones, and chatted across hedgerows.  Husbands tilled fields, looked after animals, mended equipment, and stopped for a mug of frothy cool ale at The Hen and Jackal.
