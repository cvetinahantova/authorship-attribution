Excerpted from How Children Fail, Revised edition, John Holt:   "[it is] true of school subjects that teaching -- 'I know something you should know and I'm going to make you learn it' -- is above all else what  prevents  learning." (emphasis in original) p.161   "The inventors of clever teaching ideas tend to think that if one good teaching idea helps to make some learning happen, a hundred good ideas will make a hundred times as much learning happen.  Not so.  A hundred good ideas may stop the learning altogether." p. 162
