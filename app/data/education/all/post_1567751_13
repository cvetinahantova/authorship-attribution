"It's all pretty obvious, so obvious that it would take an idiot not to see it! We all know that Mister God made man in HIs own image and images are found in mirrors. Mirrors turned you back to front or left to right. Images were 'take-away' things. So putting it all together, Mister God was and Mister God is on one side of the mirror, Mister God was on the 'add' side. We were on the other side of the mirror so we were on the 'take-away' side. We ought to have known that. When Mum puts the toddler down and backs off a few paces she does so in order to encourage the toddler to walk to her. So did Mister God. Mister God puts you down on the 'take-away' side of the mirror and then asks you to find your way to the 'add' side of the mirror. You see He wants you to be like Him.  ...  On our side of the looking-glass the whole place was littered with holes of various depths of people living at the bottom. On Mister God's side were appropriate piles of whatever, ready to fill up the holes if only we'd got the sense to ask for them. The piles also had names like 'Generosity', 'Kindness' and 'Truth'. The more you filled up your hole the nearer to Mister God's side of the mirror you got. If you managed to fill up your hole and still have something left over, why then you were well and truly on the 'add' side. Mister God's side. You'll understand of course that Mister God looks into His mirror and sees us all, but we can't see Mister God. I mean, after all, a mirror-image can't see what's looking at it. As Anna said, 'Your face reflection can't see you, can it?' Occasionally Mister God sees fit to do something about somebody's hole, He - well - He sort of fills it up for them. It was what we called a 'mirror-cle'!   ~"Mister God, this is Anna" by Fynn
