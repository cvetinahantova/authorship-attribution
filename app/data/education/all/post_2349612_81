just kidding.  dude, so i was up later than necessary last night.  one class today and i've spent a whole afternoon since.  after class, eric and me got lunch (at subway... this is why thursday is "subway day"), went to lowe's to try to buy a little metal rod to replace one that goes in the leg of my telescope tripod that we lost, were unsuccessful... drove out to where we go stargazing to search the ground for the missing piece, were still unsuccessful, went by starbucks and went home... talked quite a bit during the whole 3 hour extravaganza:  comment 1: "i think that you have a very different way of interacting with the world and with people than like... everyone"  comment 2: "have you ever been tested for ADD/ADHD?  like not that you have it or whatever, but like you do have some common behaviors with people who actually have it that i know... but then again i wonder, how do we decide that a behavior is wrong and needs changing just because it's different per se?"  i've been jokingly told i have ADD or ADHD before and i'm in denial...  jokingly ... not concerned really, just got me thinking about why it is i act the way i usually do... why i almost always need to be "active" in my interaction with other people and why i get fidgety if there's not enough background noise/colors/interaction going on around me... who knows, maybe i am... but you know what... i don't care =P  ironically enough, i had decided this afternoon would be a "mental health day"... sooo much work and sooo little sleep this week that i need it... reading/lounging, and watching friends and the apprentice later... should be a party... do dah =)  the end.
