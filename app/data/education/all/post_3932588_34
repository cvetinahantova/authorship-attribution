Thank you Mary Kay, Debra, Wendy and Bonnie for mapping out our runs in some of the most beautiful spots of San Diego. Part of the excitement, in our Sunday run, is anticipating where the trail will lead us. Even though we had to run up HILLS, I have enjoyed the trails and the scenery. I loved running through the seemingly country roads of Rose Canyon, looking over and up the cliffs of Encinitas and La Jolla and checking out the homes in La Jolla.  Thanks again for your time and effort. It really is appreciated.
