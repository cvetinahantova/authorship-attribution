I have been informed that there are some interesting posts going on in my comment section.  I can neither see them nor do anything about it.  But whatever I don't care, I'll eventually find a computer that will let me read them.  So have fun until then.  Shit I was going to blog but got caught up talking online.  I'll blog later tonight I think.  I have to talk about The Matrix and stuff.
