When I was a kid I had a  Henry's Cat  mug with the above motto on it which I hold true to this day. The motto, I mean. I'm not sure what is more disturbing; that I take advice from a piece of cheap-ass ceramic emblazoned with a long-defunct cartoon character, or the fact that I choose to boast about it.  The upshot of this is that I came straight home from school at 3.30pm and went directly to bed. Fully clothed. Which part of the day would you like me to whinge about first?  How about that DT girl got a job at my school and is strutting about like the teaching prodigy she is, making friends with the staff, talking about next term and about how 'everything's all serious now'. Yeah, because it wasn't before.  Or perhaps that  urlLink that Rob  is right. There are no jobs. None. There are jobs in Edinburgh! But no, no jobs to be had in London town. Am applying for things in Kent which is all hassley because of the boy's work. Otherwise quite good because of well-behaved children, leafy surroundings and affordable property. But still.  OR there is always the near-hysteria that accompanies my skills tests tomorrow morning. I am taking the well-worn revision route of 'If I don't know it by now ...' Always a winner.  And finally, in a heartwarming Newsround moment, my HoD stormed into my lesson today and gave everyone a bollocking for making far too much noise. Shit.  Yes, I know that none of this is entertaining reading. And I know that all of it is better than war, death, famine, divorce or a poke in the eye. But I am still wound up and frankly it's better to post here than to lay it on Christophe when he gets home. Poor old thing.  In other news: ARE YOU COMING TO OUR EXHIBITION? I HAVE NO ONE COMING! YOU CAN BE MY GUEST! Well, Chris might come, or he might be in Cannes. But you should come anyway. THERE IS WINE.
