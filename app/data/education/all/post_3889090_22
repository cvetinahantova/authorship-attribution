What is important?   me of course.  me is the only thing I can know for certain and it is only because of the existence of me that I am aware of both me and non me [my logic is a bit shaky admittedly, because I keep referring to 'I' as something separate to 'me' which of course it isn't. It's just not possible to imagine anything without there existing a 'me'.] Reality is the perception of 'non me' and 'me' by 'me'. My continued existence is the most important thing. Anything I do that has no influence on 'me', is a waste of my time. Even noble notions of selflessness have a me focus. They all reward 'me' in eternal life or present life with something. Even selfless unconditional love has a me focus: The giving of love in a selfless way brings an immense amount of joy, and hence benefit, to the giver. I sincerely believe this. There is nothing truly selfless, for anything completely selfless is an utter waste of time.
