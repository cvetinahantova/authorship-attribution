Oy.  The kids are out of their minds.  When I was little, I used to catch grasshoppers in my backyard and keep them in a jar with a little grass.  When I would get a whole bunch of them in one jar, I would shake it up and watch the grasshoppers leap around frantically inside the jar.  They would smack into each other and smack into the sides of the jar.  Watching the kids today was like watching the grasshoppers.  Absolute chaos.  Two students (that I know of) were placed in ISS for the remainder of the week today and one student was suspended for the rest of the year.  Another student of mine had paint thrown on him in another class, so he washed and dried his clothes in the home ec. room during my class.  So, I don't know what to do.  I got a call yesterday afternoon from a tutoring center in Dallas who is looking for an education director.  I vaguely remember applying for the job and thinking "I am way under-qualified for this."  But, lo and behold, they called me.  The lady left a message and wanted me to call her back with times I am available which I did today.  In the meantime, I thought I better try to find this job posting again.  Basically, I would hire and train teachers, set-up tutoring and testing schedules, and have occassional contact with parents and students.  It's a full-time position, with full benefits.  However, I don't know what the salary is - and I never know if/when it's appropriate to ask.  I also don't know what part of Dallas it is in - which will make or break the situation for me.  I hope she calls me back.  I sent an email out to some of the teachers in the district who I had worked closely with these past two years.  Just thanking them and asking them to keep in touch.  How many did I hear back from?  2.  Wow.  I feel appreciated.    The things which hurt, instruct.   Benjamin Franklin      urlLink Thank you, Plano parents, for being out of your God-lovin' minds.
