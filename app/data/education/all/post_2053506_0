I got my shipment of yarn today in the mail.  The extra stuff I'll need to finish my ruana.  I think I'll probably have leftovers, but I am always paranoid of not having enough to finish my projects.  I have only ever ordered from  urlLink Elann  and I always pleased with their speediness, packaging, and prices.  They always seem to have tons of sales.  I love just browsing - you should take a look, it's rather addicting.  Window shopping for yarn.
