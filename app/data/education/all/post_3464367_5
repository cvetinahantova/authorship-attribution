Today is a powerful day.  There is only 24 hours that I will have access to.  I can't do it all today, there are some things that will have to wait until tomorrow or the next day or maybe a year or two from now.  It's funny how life works out in its timing.    We buried my 95 year old grandmother today.  Today was the first time all her grandchildren were together in years.  I was planning a big trip for this weekend, but for whatever reason I ended up planning it for next weekend.   urlLink It just wasn't the right time .  I began my planning several months ago.  Then last Saturday my grandmother died and this is the weekend of her funeral.  He is an awesome God, it not only my own life but others that were depending on his timing.    Think about it, we spend our whole life planning for things.  Projecting dates, prepare time lines, and predicting outcomes but we are not the ones really in control. God is in controls!  Our plans are only request. He is the one that gets the final say so on when our plans will happen.  Our plans will happen on his timing, not our own.  Don't get me wrong, I am not say you shouldn't bother planning.  I am just saying that our Heavenly Father is the one that not only approves whether our plans will or will not occur, but when they will occur.  Go ahead and make your request known to him, but keep in mind He has final authority.  Just go with the flow, since He is working it out for our good in due time.  Keep smiling, the King has another move.  :)
