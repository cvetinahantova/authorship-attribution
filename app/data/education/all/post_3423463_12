as life drifts slowly past i grasp the edges of driftwood and try to stay afloat and hold my loves and cares  yet it seems that often i lose my grip sometimes on float sometimes on sink  she is still float though but it seems sinking sometimes as i struggle to do something to help her and free her from pain  but there isn't anything to do and the things i can do feel so useless
