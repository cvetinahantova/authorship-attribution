Am I in trouble?   I discovered my computer's DVD program a few nights ago when I was trying to find something to inspire a little energy while I was trying to finish up a discussion question. Naturally, I went for an Angel DVD, perhaps feeling a bit nostalgic for the rapidly ending series. I still cannot discern why the WB would call it to so short of an end when there are so many story lines yet to work through and so many fans waiting to see them. It's one of those shows like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Garrison Keeler's (sp?) Prarie Home Companion that subtly reminds you that you're not quite as old or grown up as you thought. Maybe I'm just a fan of angst, but it did the trick - both keeping me awake and stirring up traces of both energy and creativity.  But since that evening, I have had the frequent habit of reaching for one DVD after another to accompany my studies.
