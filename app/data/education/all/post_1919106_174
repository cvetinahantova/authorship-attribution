SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIT SHI TITTY  (mmm... boobies) SHIT FUCK THE FUCKING FUCKER FUCK FUCK FUCK DAMNIT FUCK SHIT FUCK.  I spent the entire  fucking week  chewing on the fucking problem from last week's assignment (needless to say that what I turned in was pure bullshit) and now that I forget about it for a night and glance at it the fucker clicks. I was approaching it from the wrong fucking direction! So here was the problem: I was to prove, using the Recursion Tree method that  T(n) = T(n/3) + T(n/2) + Theta(1)  was  O(n) . Now I spent a lot of time banging my head against the wall trying to work out the sloppy cost of the leafs nodes, but I just realized that  I didn't fucking need to!  He had already given me the answer with the problem, and all I needed to do was to plug  O(n)  into  T(n)  and prove that  T(n)  . Which is a much,  much  easier thing to do.
