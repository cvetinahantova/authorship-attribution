Just an update on some recent events....    Yesterday  - Posted a poem about something my crush said that really hurt me. I guess that's whats wrong with most people, and even me sometimes, they dont really think before they speak and with that, they unknowingly hurt others feelings :(    Today  - Woke up, ate breakfast, took a bath, brushed my teeth, got dressed and attended the Reserve Officers Training Corps w/c is a requirement here in college every saturday. Just started working on the riffle today actually and it was cool. After that, went to this place called "Sans Rival" to eat spaghetti and a slice of cake with my friends. After that, went to the boulevard and took some walk and after a few paces, just saw our president having lunch on some kind of function or something... Anyway... Just realized that, 3 of my friends and I are there walking, strolling, while the President of the Philippines is just a few feet away. i dont know what came over me... but... (what the heck!!!) just forget about it... hehe   Anyway, after that, just went to fetch another friend and here we are now in the cafe. Tonight will actually be our all-dormitory acquaintance party. See yah there ;p
