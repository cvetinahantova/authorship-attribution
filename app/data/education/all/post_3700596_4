Sounds like something out of StarTrek doesn't it.  I really believe that working in teams is better than working alone. However, I don't think that being in close proximity physically is a requirement of such success. I think tools like the one here at  urlLink Help  HalfBakery are an excellent example of the way things start out small and then grow into something of value. It is currently just an area to play. A bit like WebLogs really, however, it goes that one step further because it assumes some interaction as opposed to being an individual broadcasting.
