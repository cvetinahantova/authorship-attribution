You're either in or you're out.  You either get it or you don't.  Last night was fabulous! And really really sad.  My friend got married and had a reception last night.  I just can't believe it...and honestly, don't really want to.    But all the Euros were there and to that I made my reference about getting it.  You either fit in or you don't.  And last night I realized once again that I do.  It made me so excited to go.  I got to practice a little Italian with George and Ida.  But the dancing and singing and the European flair...it has been so missed.  I miss hanging out with these guys.  But one has moved to San Fran, another to Cincinatti.  B. is probably moving to Kentucky.  Why did we all have to grow up? I miss those days.  Now we're all married with kids and steady jobs.  Not really "we" but you know what I mean.    Anyway, the point I am trying to come across is that I am going to fit in fabulously over there and last night confirmed it.  I am now excited!!
