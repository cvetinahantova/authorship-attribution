OK, I'm not quite up to a plan yet....but I do have some ideas for themes.  Cultural literacy is important to the SNPP group, and one of the reasons they like the Simpsons is that (at least for the earlier "good" seasons) intelligent watching requires a degree of cultural literacy.  This kind of reminds me that I saw a review Ben Stein ("Win Ben Stein's money," and "God" on Drew Carey) did in the last couple of years claiming that the Simpsons was the best program of the 90s (or something like that).  Now, where did I see that!?!  I'm guessing that cultural literacy (in some guise) comes up in that review.
