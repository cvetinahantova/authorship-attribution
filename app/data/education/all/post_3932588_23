I have played a bit with setting up a blog for Step Up For Life! My name is Joe Crawford, and I blog at  urlLink ArtLung Blog  and also at  urlLink San Diego Blog . Here, the members of MaryKay's group can talk about their progress, and in turn, MaryKay can give her tips and tricks, as well as post schedules and the like.  Questions? Just contact me  urlLink at this form .  Thanks for reading!
