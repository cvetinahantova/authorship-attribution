urlLink Early-Decision Programs. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digests is written by Tammy Holub.  It reviews the issues relating to early-decision admission programs in higher education.  From the ERIC Digest:  Another controversial aspect of early decision is that colleges use the program to increase their rankings in U.S. News & World Report's "America's Best Colleges" (See Fallows, 2001; Ehrenberg, 2000). According to James Fallows, a former editor of U.S. News & World Report, a college's selectivity and yield are two statistics used to determine college rank. Selectivity measures the difficulty of being admitted to a school and yield measures the proportion of students who attend (Fallows, 2001). Every college has a target number of students for acceptance each year. When a college admits a large portion of its entering class through early decision, it can send out fewer offers than it would have to without early decision. Thus, early decision increases a college's yield and selectivity, potentially moving the college higher in the U.S. News rankings. Many argue that colleges who use early decision mainly to increase their rankings are performing a great disservice to students.    Cornell professor Ronald Ehrenberg, who has studied the controversy surrounding college rankings, argues that "It is reasonable to suggest that we would be better off as a society if institutions limited the number of students that they enroll through the early-decision process" (Ehrenberg, 2000, p. 90). Many colleges insist on maintaining their early-decision programs, claiming that they would be at a disadvantage if they ended their programs if their rivals did not do the same (See Ehrenberg, 2000, p. 90; Arenson , 2001, p. D1).
