AbbieDabbie is going to Vacation Bible School at a church near our house this week.  So far, she is enjoying it, and it has been a good thing for my moma, who has been taking care of her for me while I work this summer.  (thanks!)  It turns out that Mom has to go back to school 3 days earlier than we had thought, so with Little Bit gone, she is able to do some work she needs to do before she goes back to school.  But, I think this school is good for her.  She gets to be with other kids and play (and get tired) for a while each day.  She has been taking  really  good naps.  Next week, though, she's going to get antsy being at home everyday, but hopefully I can think of things to keep her busy in the afternoons after I get home from school.  We are going to try to go to the zoo Friday.  Hopefully it will work out, as long as she's not too tired after being at the bible school all morning.  If she is, hey, it's a fact of life that people get tired, but we'll see.  I am needing to get out and break the monotony of going to work and then going straight home and staying there every day.  We also are going to the lake this weekend.  WAHOO!  So nice.  Abbie has never been there, and so I am excited because I remember how fun it was when I was a kid.  The water level is very low, so it won't be quite the same, but I still think she will like it.
