The main point of this article is whether or not computers should be incorporated into the curriculum at such a young age.  This article is very controversial in the sense that I am battling with this very issue in my own home.  My children are ages 3 and 6.  My husband is a software engineer, and we have a computer in most every room of our home.  My son is able to surf the net, only when supervised, to find Nickleodeon.com, or Barney.com for my 3-year old.  I am always asking myself if he will be athletic or if he will be creative in school because he is often only interested in playing computer games.  With this in mind, my husband and I began to limit his computer time significantly.  After doing so, my son learned--almost immediately--to tie his shoes, to get himself dressed, and also how to build skyscrapers from Legos.  He also began playing outside more with the neighbors, and has since acquired a new best friend.  My son is on a soccer team where he was the team MVP during the Spring 2004 season.  I am confident that this all stems from the fact that I turned off the computer, and introduced him to a world of so much more.    It is however, very important for students to have computer skills.  I think that the important thing is for parents to monitor computer time as they would anything else.  Many parents look at computers as babysitters.  If a child is computer literate and younger than 14, they can spend countless hours on the computer.  Parents can do chores and take naps, and the child never bothers anyone.  Students should have the privilege of technological exposure, however, just as you must watch a child in a swimming pool, you must use the same judgment with children using computers.
