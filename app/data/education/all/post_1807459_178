Yeah so last night before going to bed I went to brush my teeth but as I attempted to do this I realized there was no toothpaste.  The only reasonable conclusion is that Gumi James took the toothpaste.  Never trust and Englishman around toothpaste.  There is another possible scenario however.  What if someone broke into my room and only stole the toothpaste without touching anything the else.  Possible, but not probable.   Today I'm taking care of stuff that needs to be taken care of.  I mailed out postcards, went shopping and did laundry.  Nothing major.  I think I'll walk over and see one tourist sight, maybe two.  I need to get a good nights sleep tonight as I'll want to leave for Cambodia tomorrow.  I picked up another lock for my bag just I can lock down absolutly everything, also some sun screen and of course more toothpaste.   I loved my time here in Bangkok but it's now time to get up and move on.  They are cleaning my room now so I'm using this chance to blog a bit.  I want to drop off the stuff I bought then I'll go out for a long walk and see what I can see.  I wonder how long the bus ride to Cambodia is?  Guess I'll find out soon.  I should get my passport back all the visas in it so I'm pretty excited to be on my way.  I think after all my running around is done I'll just hang out in Starbucks and read or write or something like that.
