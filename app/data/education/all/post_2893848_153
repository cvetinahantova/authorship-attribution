Sweep Sweep Back's Badass Song   The Yankees can have all the  urlLink intangibles  they want.  The  urlLink tangibles  are decidedly on the side of the Red Sox lately.  Sometimes, my mother likes to remind me that the weekend I was born, the Sox swept the Yankees.  She says my Dad was euphoric to receive this blessing at the same time as he received me, his first and eventually only son.  She also talks about a  urlLink rainbow  spanning the sky, but you know, Moms are like that.  Googling for a picture of Jeter, I stumbled  urlLink this   ( marginally  worksafe; Jeter is on page two).  I'm glad to know that Gabe Kapler is  somebody's  favorite baseball player.  God Bless Pedro, God Bless Manny.  We are your overlords, Yankers.
