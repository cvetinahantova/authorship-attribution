Shane's Download Of The Day      Today's download is an awesome web browser, Mozilla Firefox. I recommend Firefox to everyone I can find, and here are just some of the reasons why:  1. Tabbed Browsing- This makes browsing the web a lot more "compact" and quicker 2. Extensible- You can increase the power of FF. There are extensions for almost everything that you can think of. Extensions allow you to make Firefox as feature-complete as you want it to. 3. Popup Blocking- We all hate popups and Firefox blocks them! 4. Open-Source- Being open-source means FF is updated very frequently and it is easy to customize it. 5. Fast- FF is the fastest browser I have ever used!!!  Go and get it  urlLink here
