First of all I want to thank all the people that went out there and voted for me yesterday (I'm no longer campaigning so I am allowed to speak of this). And Second, I know, I too am disappointed about this, we will not know the outcome of this election for now. When I called to get the official count from insiders yesterday, It was disappointing to hear that the scantron, the machine that counts the ballots, was broken. Therefore, unless the SA is willing to hand-count ballots, we must wait until a replacement arrives, or we get the machine fixed.
