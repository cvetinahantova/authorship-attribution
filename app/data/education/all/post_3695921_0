After days complaining about everything, it´s about time I posted something more interesting. At least, for those who really care!!    Well, thats´s it, here is a list of the hottest guys in my modest opinion. As there are so many, I decided to put them into categories. Let´s go then:    COUNTRIES: every part of the world there is that guy, a real symbol of beauty.The winners are:    Spain : Antonio Bandeiras - Madonna was right. He´s really charming.   Great Britain:  Hugh Grant and Orlando Bloom. Both are really good looking. Every time I watch Notting Hill, it´s easy to understand the reason Julia Robert´s character was down over heels for him. In case of Bloom, well Legolas - should I say anything else? David Beckham - Victoria is definetely lucky - watermouthing.   Mexico:  he´s just arrived - Gael Garcia Bernal. Besides, he´s idealistic. This is cute, isn´t?   United States  - since it´s the place of Hollywood stars, the categories are sub-divided: * Tom Cruise - my teen crush. * Brad Pitt - his movies are awful, but he´s hot. * Tom Welling - the young Clark Kent is handsome and also he´s playing the role of my favourite super hero. * Paul Walker - I was watching MTV Movie Awards and suddenly, a curly blond haired boy shows up. Who´s that? was crossing my mind. * Josh Harnett - sweet, sweet, sweet. * Dr Carter and Dr Kovac - without them, I wouldn´t see ER. * CSI Warrick - uauh!   Brazil   * Reynaldo Gianechini - he´s got it all! * Raí - I met him and love at first sight. He kisses his fans. Nice!   Italy   * I usually look forward to watching an Italian team match. You always find out one at least. They might play badly, they look good though!   I can´t remember anything else, but they are here. I may have forgotten a few. That´s my teen moment so enjoy it!!
