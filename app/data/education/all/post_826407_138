Spent most of yesterday at Philadelphia preparing for Profile, our clubbing meets social action night.  Had a lot of fun preparing for it with other people, a great way to spend a Saturday.  The night itself felt amazing.  The event felt like a little festival with loads of different stalls, activities and people.  Just wandering round the place I saw people doing their thing in groups, dancing, creating, campaigning, praying, juggling, talking.  Man what a buzz - now this is church!  The music itself was fantastic.  DJ Tambe kicked it all off in his own distinctive way, (nu-jazz/hip-hop/carnival beats), Andy H and MC Testament then upped the tempo with breaks and live hip-hop (including breakdancers and beatbox battle) before Matt finished us off with tasty new school breaks.    Action stuff included our own little sweatshop to sew together the bits of the  urlLink Speak  giant dress, a dance upon injustice playstation dance mat.  Letters, petitions and pledges on fair trade etc.  And a chance to make bracelets that reminded you to act justly.  Here is mine.       Perhaps the coolest thing for me was that loads of people stayed at the end to clear up the place.  We had to take down the all the decor including a large tent pavilion and chill out area and then put the chairs back into the worship area.  But we were really blessed by so many helpers.  Thanks guys.  Dave, Tim and Simon, thanks so much for making this happen, it was amazing.  St Toms and Connect thanks for letting us try this out. And God thanks for being there and bringing it all together.  Now help us to live out the things we talked, wrote, danced and prayed about.  Photos will follow soon...
