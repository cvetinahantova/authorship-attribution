urlLink Library in the Sky - Editor's Picks  I am happy to see that LibraryInstruction.Com was selected as Library in the Sky Editor's Pick of the Week. urlLink   I have put a lot of work into this site over the last year and a half.  It now has over 40 articles and a dozen lesson plans.  There are also a few PowerPoint presentation available for download.  I don't know who the editor is at Library in the Sky but thanks. I am grateful and hope some more educators find my site.
