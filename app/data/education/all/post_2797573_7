Anne of Green Gables is over.  It's always sad when a production ends, even if I wasn't in this one.  I like all the people I see at the theater.  Yesterday Sean and I went to the park alone and had a good talk.  We haven't really done that too much lately.  He may even try to look for another job.  It would be so nice if he could work a normal work week and spend more time with the family.  His job has been so stressful lately.  It was good that we could talk about how we are feeling and not get mad at each other.  I spoke to our lawyer this morning and she gave me some hope that we can get our finances under control.  We may be able to get our monthly payments lowered or even stopped.  They've taken so much out of our checks that we don't have much to live on.  What a relief.  Now, if I could start having my body feel better I would be happy.  I have a dr. appt. this afternoon.  My dr. is leaving the practice soon, so I'm very bummed.  I hope she can help me get established with another dr. so that I don't have to start all over again!  Tomorrow night Jacob is receiving his scholarships at an awards ceremony at his school.  We are very proud of him!
