Phil was right, he does let me babble without interrupting me but it usually ends with a "you're dumb" but that's why i love him lol... did i spell my title right? haha  anyway! in my last post i talked about why i like my blog and now here's why i dont like it... i shouldn't talk about things that no one needs to know about... but i do it anyway so here it goes...  the last time i talked about this i was harrased on AIM by one of the parties involved, maybe this time it will go over a little better... i feel really selfish about what happened last week. the post that night talked about messing with ppls emotions on really personal levels, maybe you remember maybe not... anyway i was so hurt about it and not knowing for sure who it was that was telling the truth. i'm so tired of being hurt and cheated on and lied to that the littlest thing freaks me out. i didn't really stop to see how it affected the other person involved in this little web of lies. and i feel awful that maybe i didn't pay enough attention to those feelings. even tho i know it's not my fault i can't help but think that it is. and i just wish there was something i could do to fix it. sometimes i think i should have kept it all to myself, like i was told to.. but that would have made me miserable and ruined the relationship i have with the other person. but by saving the relationship between this other person and myself i destroyed a relationship between this person and another.. what would you have done?
