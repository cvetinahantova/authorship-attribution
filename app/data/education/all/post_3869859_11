Tonight's my first big presentation for my new job with NASA. I get to talk to teachers about all the cool research that scientists are doing on the ground and on the International Space Station (ISS). I'm a bit nervous about it, partly because it's my first presentation as part of a new job, partly because I'm worried I don't know enough about the content. But I only have to speak for 15 minutes (with a PowerPoint), then the teachers will get to do hands-on activities after that.     Today I get to work from home, something I couldn't do as a teacher!! Yay!     Ok, so I guess that means I should actually get some work done. Since I don't have sick days accrued yet, I've got to work a long day to make up for hours missed yesterday and Monday.
