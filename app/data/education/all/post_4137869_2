Dear Journal,            I went out last night with Kim and Jennifer, and their friend Christa.  I actually had a lot of fun; I was half expecting to be so bored out of my mind I’d get too drunk and sleep in the car until we left.  I didn’t get bored the whole time there, there being Zone 154.  I saw a few people I used to know, and met some new ones too.  I saw Chris Watson, went to school with him.  He used to be short and pudgy, but now he’s tall, thin and hot!!  He’s got a major infatuation for Jennifer.  I also saw Jonathan Wilkins; we “dated” briefly in 1995.  We saw Dwayne there, and Terri too (Terri’s one of Kim’s flings).  New people I met were Edward (Kim’s crushing’), Jason, and Buger aka Brian.  And there’s also Jeremy.  When we first got to the club and I saw him, I thought he was so cute, just so you know it wasn’t the alcohol.  He told Brian who told Christa who told me that he wanted to hook up with me.  That was so kute!!  What I know about him:  Hmm, well he’s 23, his birthday is June 28th, he’s got a job, and a truck.  All day I’ve been thinking about Jeremy, debating on whether I should get his number.  I kept thinking, “Well, he’s probably lost interest...  I bet he thinks I blew him off (after talking outside with him a while we went in and I danced with Jonathan)...  We live too far away from each other to ever consider having a relationship...  We practically in two different worlds!”  But a bit after Kim and I got home, she came in my room and gave me a piece of paper.  When I looked at it I was confused, excited and hopeful, but mostly just flattered.  Jeremy- (919) 732-5499 Will I call him??  Hell yeah!  I’m not stupid.  Kim told me later, “You need to call him, so he’ll stop calling Brian, and so Brian will stop calling me and Jennifer.”  It turns out he called Brian like 5 times telling him to call Jennifer to call Kim to give me his digits.  I’ve had a smile plastered to me face ever since.  And he’s NOTHING like what I usually go for.  He’s tall, and big, not fat, but big...  He’s definitely got muscles in those arms.  While we were outside talking, (among other things I said) he asked if he could kiss me.  I so so SO wanted him to, but I just kept changing the subject.  Oh my God!  I actually told him one of my fantasies (one that no one knows, not even Kimberly)!  I don’t know why I told him, but he was just like, “Why watch when you can be in on it?”  I’m so glad he’s still interested, because I really do want to get up with him!!
