Final Fantasy VII   After seeing Final Fantasy VII win the Best.Game.Ever award at GameFAQs, I decided to start a new game of it (I was at disc 2 and I took a long break and I was too confused about what was going on in the story so I had to start a new game). Well.... that will probably be sucking up most of my time throughout the next few weeks. ;-)
