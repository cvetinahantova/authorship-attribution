urlLink    Photos from JYF are finally available! Here's me having lots of fun in Coventry with Verity and Kris. *grin*Â  urlLink     Heeee. JYF in 22 days. Of course, before then I have to sit 9 exams and go to (groan) the leavers' ball, but still, it's nice to have something to take my mind off them. I wish it wasn't Laura's birthday that day, things would be so much easier. Sigh. But I am pleased with the photos - I like the JYF piccies because they give me a good way of tracking how much weight I've lost; there are photos from Jan 2003 all the way up to March 2004, so it's a great gauge of how I'm doing. And they make me laugh out loud, which is always good for your health.  I had a terrible driving lesson today. I started off quite well doing a three point turn, but then it all seemed to go downhill from there as I seemed to forget how to operate the car; I forgot to indicate, position the car for turning and use the handbrake. Gah. Next week we start parallel parking, which should be... interesting...  Ceff x   There's something obscene in a dream...
