Why must it rain!    Â  I'm siiiiicccck of it! Why does it rain!! It's been raining here forever!! We get barely any sunny days..and when we do, it's only for A day!! Mmm...rain also stinks because it poofs my hair up..as if it's not poofed up enough. Suppose it's about time I get a change...and shave it all off. Nahh or um hmmmmmmmm...
