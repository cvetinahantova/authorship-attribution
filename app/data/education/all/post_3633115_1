I don't claim to be all knowing in the world of English.  I actually consider myself to be quite ignorant.  However, I do know that there are certain things about people that really irritate me.  The primary thing that bugs me is people who refuse to speak English properly.  English is really not that difficult.  You don't need to know what a dangling modifier is or what a participle is, but one really should know the difference between "well" and "good."  I hope to some day be an English teacher to junior high school children.  Glutton for punishment some may say.  I just hope to instill some appreciation for proper English.  Being from Texas is not an excuse to say that a toy is "broke" rather than saying a toy is "broken."  I cannot stand that my mother in law, who teaches third grade, does not know the difference between "well" and "good."  She is a teacher for heaven's sake.  No wonder our public school system is so awful.  If the teacher's cannot practice what they teach, then how are they to expect a student to practice what they are taught?  Furthermore, saying something such as this is the year two thousand  and  four is WRONG.  A serious pet peeve of mine.  The year is two thousand four.  And is indicative of using a decimal point. A good example is when one writes a check.  If the amount for the check is $5.25, then one should write five  and  25/xx (or 00 whatever) dollars.  Okay, I think I am now done ranting.  Though this may come up again, as I tend to lose it after a time of witnessing such carelessness when using the (American) English language.
