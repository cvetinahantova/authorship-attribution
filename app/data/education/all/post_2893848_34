My DSL is finally operative, and so, as promised, more items of possible interest: 1.  How glad was I to hear yesterday that Verizon's grip on the teletech industry will only become tighter in the years to come?  Not so glad.  They needed a month of lead-in time to move our phone line, and still they were late with it.  We didn't even change our phone number! 2.  Have you heard the new joint from the roots?  damn that shit is hot.  East.  Coast. 3.  Ryan also just sent me "Lifted or..." by Bright Eyes.  Track 2's pretty great. 4.  Did anyone read the article about the giant squids in the New Yorker a couple weeks ago?  I read it last night.  I bet they're smarter than we think they are.  They're like giant brains floating around in the ocean, and  hiding from us.  Spooky.  Henrick Herzberg especially. 5.  Speaking of giant brains, has anyone read Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris"?  I really liked it.  A few months ago I watched Tarkovsky's adaptation and thought it was decent.  Word on the street is that when Lem saw Soderberg's version he took back everything bad he'd ever said about Tarkovsky. 6.  Shrek 2 was fun.  Puss in boots, yes.  I also recently watched and loved Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery Train." 7.  I just read a bunch of stories by Peter Taylor.  He was a monster of a writer!  How come I've never heard of this guy. 8.  So 7 was a veiled plea for recommendations and brief reviews.  It's one thing the lot of us are good for, for God's sake.  9.  I'm getting carried away, though.  In the future I promise not to post as many of my own. 10.  Have I mentioned that my apartment came with a piano? 11.  Rob Neyer's column on ESPN.com is no longer free.  Bastards!  My baseball IQ just plummeted.  12.  Reagan had a teabag coming to him that never got administered.  And that's the last that I'll say about all that.     Toodles-
