The fire has grown from 5500 acres yesterday morning to 33,000 acres this afternoon.  It has been so smoky all day we can't see what is going on, but for the most part the fire spread a lot to the south, which is away from the city.  Unfortunately, that direction is headed directly for my Aunt and Uncle's house in Naramata.  Tonight the wind is supposed to switch back to the north and start blowing it back towards Kelowna again.  It's about 3 km from my mom's house.  She has rented a storage unit and has moved all of her photos and important stuff.  Every day that she's on alert, she finds more things to move though.  She is so stressed out...
