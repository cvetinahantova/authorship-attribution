Posted on Wed, Jan. 21, 2004	 Dean's Iowa speech shocks many By Jim Rutenberg NEW YORK TIMES   DES MOINES, Iowa - Sen. John Kerry's victory in Iowa took the political world by surprise, but it was Howard Dean's guttural, concession-speech battle cry that was as much the talk of the political world Tuesday.  The question that bounced around TV, radio, the Internet and even the Des Moines airport was if the speech would prove a defining political moment for Dean just as voters start paying close attention to the Democratic race.  "He looked hysterical," Howard Wolfson, a Democratic consultant said on the "NBC Nightly News."  "Howard Dean scared a lot of children last night," Tucker Carlson, a Republican political commentator, declared on CNN.  Like the other cable news networks, CNN played the image of Dean, shirt sleeves rolled up, neck bulging and arm pointing at the crowd, over and over.  The radio host Howard Stern played a recording of the tape and set it against background noise from a professional wrestling match.  Republican officials could not have been happier.  "That's six ads," one party official said, referring playfully to the number of advertisements that might be mined from that appearance in order to reinforce opponents' efforts to portray Dean as angry and nonpresidential.  Even some of Dean's supporters wondered how the speech would affect the race.  Dan Goldberg, a marketing executive with an independent film company in New York, said he had been planning to volunteer for Dean in New Hampshire.  After watching his Monday night speech, Goldberg said, he changed his mind.  "Any chances I would vote for Dean were completely erased by that speech last night -- scary," he said.  "I thought mirrors in my apartment would shatter. Especially in contrast with Edwards, who was fantastic."  Dean and his staff described the focus on his speech as another instance of unfair treatment at the hands of the news media, which they accused of turning an surprisingly upbeat address, despite a third-place finish, into a negative.  But political experts and some Democrats said the speech could prove to be for Dean what Dan Quayle's famous misspelling of the word "potato" was for him in 1992: a reinforcement of a perceived character flaw.  In Quayle's case, the misspelling went to questions, fair or not, about his intelligence.  In Dean's case, the speech went to questions about his temperament.  Even before Monday night, rivals sought to portray Dean as the angriest man in politics, prompting "Saturday Night Live" last weekend to caricature him as an offensive, cursing egomaniac.  Darrell West, a professor of political science at Brown University, said of Dean's appearance, "I think many people watching it would have thought he was just losing it, big time.  "It's a moment that provides a window into the soul of the man, and it reinforces many of the fears that people have expressed about Dean: That he's angry and that he doesn't have the proper temperament to be president."  Then again, other presidential candidates have had similarly low televised moments and still gone on to win or retain the White House.  During the 1992 primary campaign, Bill Clinton, after erroneously concluding that the Rev. Jesse Jackson had endorsed Sen. Tom Harkin (and also wrongly thinking that a nearby camera was turned off), called the move a "dirty, double-crossing, backstabbing thing to do."  It was a rare glimpse of one of Clinton's flares of temper. But that was before the age of three cable news networks and heavy Internet use, and it did no apparent damage to his campaign.  Dean and his aides played down the attention paid to the speech. Answering questions from reporters in New Hampshire, Dean said he was simply trying to rally Iowa volunteers gathered to see him off Monday night.  "Last night there were 3,500 people there who had worked for weeks in Iowa," he said. "And I thought I owed them the reason they came to this campaign, which was passion."  Responding to characterizations of the speech as a "meltdown" Dean's media strategist, Steve McMahon, said, "It was not.  "It was an acknowledgment that Sen. Kerry had won a primary but the people in that room had changed politics forever."  In a telephone interview, Joe Trippi, Dean's campaign manager, vented frustration with the coverage of the address.  "I think it's being mischaracterized. That's another thing that we're used to," Trippi said.  "I kind of thought that the news of the night was that, when he walked on the stage, the party was more energized than any victory party I have ever been to."    Dean's act in Iowa is over the top Candidate's speech raises eyebrows after caucuses Radio & TV: David Folkenflik  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Originally published Jan 21, 2004  Democrat Howard Dean's fiery oratorical style has clearly stirred a devoted core of followers. But as the former Vermont governor attempts to rebound from his third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, the question is not: Can he lead the country? The question is: Can he do TV?  Here's what the printed transcript would tell you Dean told supporters Monday night as they waved flags and cheered.  "Not only are we going to New Hampshire," Dean said. "We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico, and we're going to California and Texas and New York. And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan. And then we're going to Washington, D.C., to take back the White House. Yeah."  But that fails to capture the alarming energy of the scene. Dean was punching the air as he barked out the name of each state in a raspy voice. And the final word in the quotation above was a surprising barbaric yawp, even from the emotive Dean - more of an extended "yeeeee-arrrghhhh" than a measly "yeah." It fired up the faithful who were processing Dean's third-place finish in the Byzantine Iowa caucuses.  And it inspired almost uniformly bad reviews.  "Television is such a hot medium. It intensifies everything," says Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University political scientist who studies media and the presidency. "You look angrier [on television]. Really, what you want to do is cool things down, not torque things up."  For one thing, no one's been that publicly demonstrative about Oklahoma since the last revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.  MSNBC news anchor Keith Olbermann says the episode was "goofy-scary - and I don't know exactly why it was scary."  Dean's fevered pitch, while seemingly an effort to rouse a group of his faithful, appeared to outsiders utterly out-of-proportion to his standing in the caucuses, Olbermann says during a telephone interview. "I'm not sure if he was doing Hulk Hogan or if his voice was Louis Armstrong," Olbermann says. "This was not a television issue. This was a political disaster that happened to be on television."  In a caption, CNN invoked "Dizzy Dean," a nice allusion for 1950s baseball fans, while an anchor referred to the "Dean Scream," a desperate effort to rhyme in the absence of alliteration.  "I'm afraid what you saw there is Howard Dean rubbing salt into his own wounds," Clifford May, a former journalist and Republican Party spokesman, said yesterday on CNN. "He was badly hurt. ... Last night, Howard Dean was not presidential." Then, going in for the kill, May resurrected the Cold War-era question: "Do you want that man with his finger on the button?"  On the air, Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron, who reported that many people say Dean looked particularly angry Monday night, remarked that rivals believe the following truism: "The angrier Howard Dean gets, the less popular he becomes." A Fox News anchor posed this question about Dean: "Is he shooting himself in the foot?"  But the media may have been piling on, says Democratic consultant Victor Kamber. "The press is making too much of it," Kamber said on CNN yesterday. "He was exuberant, he was tired. His people in the room loved it. Critics didn't like it. I don't think it'll have one iota of bearing in terms of going forward."  Initially, Dean defended his remarks. But by yesterday afternoon, according to the Reuters news wire, he changed course. "Today, I am going to give a different kind of speech," Dean told supporters in Manchester, N.H. "Those of you who came here intending to be lifted by ... a lot of red-meat rhetoric are going to be a little disappointed."  That's probably overdue. Kumar, the Towson scholar, says people tend to seek leaders with a personality that comes across as moderate. And Dean's Monday-night geography rant will only affirm lingering doubts about his temperament. "Bursts like that of hyperactivity - the public does not look favorably on that," she says. "That kind of exhibition will stick in our minds."  A year ago, Olbermann touted Dean as a plausible dark-horse candidate. Now, Olbermann says of the one-time leader of the pack, "We're not debating if Howard Dean was imploding - we're asking why. And that's not a good place for a professional politician to be."
