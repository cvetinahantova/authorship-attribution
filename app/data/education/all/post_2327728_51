We have a new lab member.  I wasn't really looking forward to my supervisor getting his new grad students, and I was shocked to come back from Alberta to find one was already here!  How dare he show up before September!  I feel cheated out of my extra time with our prof. I was nearly petulant yesterday.   But!  There is an up-side.  Darren is basically the male version of me, so he is great!  We share a sense of humor, taste in politics, television and I suspect movies.  He spent some time teaching English in Asia, just like me!  And seeing as he is here in this lab, we obviously share a similar interest in research.  No crushes yet, but I think I have become asexual.  I *do* think we will become good friends, if he doesn't start to annoy me.  Knowing me (X2!), he will.  Shortly.  But I will try to be optomistic... he probably won't annoy me as much as John.  FYI - I am writing this about 2 feet from where Darren is sitting.  It only goes to show that people around you might be thinking nice things about you.  Or mean things.  Whatever.  I suggest you make the assumption that the person in the next room is thinking something really nice about you, and are making a note to tell a friend that nice think later.  Or their blog. :D  Finally,  I set up audioblogger, and I'm goin' out tonight!  Perhaps if things get rowdy, I will call in a message to say hello, and have Vanessa say somethin' funny.  Or Amber.  Yeah!
