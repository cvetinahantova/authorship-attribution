The  urlLink NYT  has a great article on Florida's felon disenfranchisement laws, describing how ex-felons appear before Governor Jeb Bush to have their voting rights restored.  The story ends as follows:   Things turned out better for Cecil Taylor, who had been convicted of driving drunk and whose college art teacher came to speak of his potential. After the board asked Mr. Taylor if he had drunk alcohol since his conviction, and Mr. Taylor said he had not, Mr. Bush restored his rights â€” with a caveat.   "I'm praying that you're not going to start drinking again," Mr. Bush told him. "When we make these decisions, sometimes it puts us in a little bit of a precarious position in that you could let us down."   So Jeb is worried about this guy  voting  for president, when his brother, also a convicted drunk driver and self-described alcoholic,  is  the president?        urlLink ');"> postCount(' ');
