Hi if you look at the SQLExpress Web Log  urlLink here  you will see that a new product for administering SQLExpress will be released as part of Beta 3. However, I just downloaded the Web Data Administrator from the Microsoft download site and it seems to work just fine. There are two versions so if like me you are using a virual machine then you can download the Cassini version which has a smaller footprint.   urlLink Click Here  for the Cassini version of the SQL WEB Data Administrator
