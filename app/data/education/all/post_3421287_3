OK.  Sweet child o'mine has landed safely, and informs me that it is very hot.  So I send back good wishes and sun cream warnings and lots of motherly love.  And I am here with just the 2.4 kids (cat equals 0.4 of a kid, in this equation), feeling a bit like a truck with a wheel missing.  So I get them videos and video games and sweets, and it still feels very odd.  And I am left wondering if: -  a) it is entirely normal to miss a child this much? And b) especially when its only a holiday!  It's not like she died, or even left home - she's only gone for two weeks!  I can't help thinking I need to get out more...
