Yesterday, one of the "bully" type kids was extra annoying to one of the other students. He is a student with explosive anger disorder. He will "fly off the handle" under circumstance which "normal" kids would be upset about, but would probably not starting yelling, cussing, and threatening harm to people, indiscriminately.   He went too far for this other person to stand, and he received four quick punches to the face. One landing squarely in one of his eyes. One might think that a fight would have occurred at this point, but that was not the case. The "bully," the one who basically antagonized and initiated the conflict, turned around and ran away. He took off. I have been hearing and seeing this students threats and posturing for more than a year now, and when he finally gets the opportunity to prove his medal, he turns tail.   That was not the end of it, though. Once the "bully" was with some adults, who he knew would contain him, he began to try to "save face" with his peers by yelling and screaming threats toward the other student from the other side of the building. At that point the whole school could hear what was going on. Now, at a "regular" school, if this type of thing transpired, it would be difficult for the rest of the students to maintain any focus, and would be dying to know what was going on. That was not the case here, which, on the surface, seems good, but I see it as startling and sad. Most of the rest of the students were able to ignore what was happening, continuing to work. These kids are so accustomed to hearing and seeing violence, and the threat of violence, at their residences and school, that they are largely unaffected by it in many cases.
