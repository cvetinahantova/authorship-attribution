Sonofabitch... dumped again.  I can't believe it and I don't quite yet understand.  I must have been misreading his signals.  I didn't think he was a player but maybe he is.  It's obvious to me now that the reason I haven't heard from him in 10 days is that he has decided to seek others.  But he doesn't have the common courtesy or anything to tell me so.  All I need is something from him saying, sorry, this is what I'm doing and why.  Then I can move on.  I just need closure!   I know for sure that he's looking for someone else because he's taken new photos of himself and had them posted on his yahoo profile.  When you look at "My Photos" you see like nine different shots of him, and they all have file names like "pers2", "pers3".  I don't know if he's using eharmony still or something else.    I'm crushed, yes.  And mad.  Mad at him for letting me down.  Mad at me for getting so hopeful.  The last time I saw him it went really well until he got paged into work.  Maybe that wasn't a page?  Maybe he set that up to use as an escape?   Other facets of my life are going well, I'm going to continue to work at things.  I have been going to the gym and working out for over two weeks now.  I'm in my third week and it feels good!  I also gave up caffeine while I was on vacation, so I think that will really help me a lot!   Anyway, don't feel much like blogging much tonight.  Later.
