Well just to make things more interesting I have just returned from the midwife who thinks our baby may be a little large,  5  weeks too large to be exact. So now I am suffering with a bad case of ' Giant baby syndrome',  or at least that's what I have lovingly decided to call it!   I had thought for a long time that the baby was seeming to kick awfully high for it's date, but today my worst fears have been recognised lol .  That's just what I need, to try and give birth to an enormous baby, as if it isn't painful enough trying to give birth to an average one! The upshot is that I have to go for another scan next week to check the real size of Little-bump. Oh well, maybe they'll discover that my dates are totally wrong and it will come early, I do hope so, this heat is killing me!  Chickie xx
