So I was simply on the phone with my dad and I had an itch on my tummy.  I simply itched it when I realized I felt something.  I looked down and low and behold, there it was.... A bug... And I brushed at it a few times when I realized... IT WAS NOT COMING OFF!  I got all scared and said, "Daddy I'm coming over because I have a tick!"  and hung up.  I scooted down the road to my house and there dad proceeded to begin the tic-ectamy as he says.  The tic quickly came off and about ten minutes later I calmed down.  Sigh... What a traumatic event!  I think I picked it up on my nature walk with the kids at the River Legacy Center in Arlington (where I am volunteering for some of the summer.  urlLink http://www.riverlegacy.org/  )  It's all over now and I'm tic-less.    FYI. Tick - Any of numerous small bloodsucking parasitic arachnids of the family Ixodidae, many of which transmit febrile diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease.  Any of various usually wingless, louselike insects of the family Hippobosciddae that are parasitic on sheep, goats, and other animals.   No wonder I was scared!
