My sister and I are total opposites. I don’t even want to enumerate because it is endless. When I became a Christian I prayed very hard to God that let my sister feel what I am feeling and to cut the long story short God had granted my request. My sister became a Christian too. It made me ecstatic. Now we can go to church together, attend cell groups together and pray together.   One night while spending our quiet time we ended up fighting again and I was shocked because I thought we would never fight again. Because we are Christians and Christians don’t fight. I was wrong.  Part of being a Christian was restoring broken relationships. And unknowingly I had a broken relationship with my younger sister. A broken relationship so long ago that I could not even remember why. She was crying and shouting words in my face and I chose not to answer because I was in awe. How could that happen. We are sisters. We don’t have anybody other than each other. She moved out of our room that night and stayed in the room across ours. Around midnight she came back saying ‘sorry’. I said sorry too, but what bothers me is the thought that this is just a temporary escape for something that has bee deteriorating a long time ago. Our friendship.   I asked her what happened and she was, like me, unsure but all she can remember is that she missed me a lot and that time I realized that I also missed my sister. I realized that I haven’t been around her for a while, suddenly there’s so many things that needs catching up. What’s her favorite show? Her favorite color? Her schedule in class? I felt numb. I felt as though my heart is pounding so hard that I might go into shock any moment.
