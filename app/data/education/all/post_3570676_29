When I first saw the assignment, I thought a blogger might be something you smoke (hee heee..) or a virus (i.e. "I have the blog"). However, it is not. I think a blogger could be used effectively for teachers and administrators. Students could edit their profiles so teachers could get to know them on a more personal level. Assignments could be posted. This would be great when weather is bad, a student is absent, or students could work ahead if they knew about a planned absence (i.e. vacation). Principals could communicate with teachers during the school day provided each class has a working computer that does connect to the internet. The Bowman Blog could be a catchy name for my blog.
