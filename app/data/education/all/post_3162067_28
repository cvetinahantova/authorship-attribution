My hair has looked good all day today! I styled it curly this morning before work, which means I'm now knackered as I was up an hour before schedule, but it's looked lovely and natural and tidy. I hate it when curly hair is brittle with hairspray. Ok day at work today, although quite exhausting and the less said about my bottom set year 7's the better. Just been exhausted and back-achy. So much I wanted to record on here but, when it comes to it, I'm just too tired to post too long a message. This reminds me why I am quitting my job. Had a really rough night last night. I developed a migraine at about 6pm and painkillers weren't touching it. It got progressively worse and made my brain go a bit funny. I started seeing things and hearing things and went on a bit of a looper, convinced something was trying to get at me. Seem to recall trying to attack my bed at one point, but the damn thing had it coming. I remember crying for at least an hour and the flowers that Si bought me made me cry even harder as I thought they were moving across the sideboard and it frightened me. I have decided to put this episode down to exhaustion and migraine, and not the mental disorder which it probably is :)
