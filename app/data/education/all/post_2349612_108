IM i just sent for starters: lkp 42 42 42: i got home from the diner w/ you guys, then like the coffee had started to set in and i was going a mile and minute, sure i wouldn't fall asleep for a bit lkp 42 42 42: eric said i dramatically slowed down to normal human speed by the time we got to 2am and that i should never have 4 vodkas and a coffee again lkp 42 42 42: we found lots of stars -- i even saw 3 moons of jupiter w/ the binoculars!  so yeah, stargazing from like 1 to 2am... found a ton of stuff, got freezing cold, had a herd of like 10 huge wild deer within 50 feet of us staring us down the whole time (how cool is that?!?!!?), talked about what we're afraid of... found lots more stars.  now, hopefully the coffee's made it enough of the way through my system for me to actually fall asleep... class in 9 hours... surely i can sleep for at least 90% of that time... i hope =P  visontlatasra!
