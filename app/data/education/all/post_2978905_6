Uh... yeah.  I have been feeling a bit crazy lately, and I wrote about it. So.. for this blog, you can read it.. and stuff.    Just Another Life to Steal  Cut it deep, to the core Cut the memories, cut them more Take a stab, rip it out Make it scream, make it shout Flip the switch, turn it on Make it weak, make it strong Take the pain, make it worse Cast a spell, cast a curse Carry on, play your game You will always feel the same Tear it up, tear and shred What do you care, you're not dead Point and laugh, point and stare Try again, one last dare Melt it, stab it, make it cut Feel the pain inside your gut? Make it hurt, make it bleed Plant your crop, plant your seed bring it forward, bring it back feed the hunger, feed the stack Grind it down, make it meat Make it sweat, accept defeat Blow it up, pop it down Show it's weakness, make it drown Hold it down, watch it go One last battle, one last show Watch it struggle, one last fight One last chance to dance tonight Wave it down, say goodbye Shed a tear, pretend to cry It was nothing, no big deal Just another life to steal You won't feel it, it's not you It's me you're casting pain on to
