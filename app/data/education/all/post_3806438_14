Kenyon Martin is officially a Net no longer.  He was traded to the Denver Nuggets for three first round draft picks.     A few thoughts on this.  I really like Kenyon's game.  He plays with abandon an tenacity and he made the Nets legitimate.  I suppose if you had to choose between K-Mart and Richard Jefferson, then you choose RJ, because he has more of an upside, but you need an inside presence like K-Mart proides to be successful, especially in the East.     I'm not sure why Denver was in such a hurry to pay Martin all that money.  They certainly have the cap space,  but they must be planning on building around Anthony and him.   They'll need to pay Carmelo the max in a couple years, and they'll have Martin under contract for 4 or 5 years after that.  Certainly they won't go over the cap and pay the luxury tax.    The Nets are not committed to winning in the next couple years.  They've taken a huge step back here, and they are no longer contenders in the East.   Their new owner, Bruce Ratner, doesn't want to pay the luxury tax and is more concerned with getting the team to Brooklyn that having them be winners.  Since he's given up on the fans in New Jersey, the New Jersey fans should gie up on him and the Nets.    Not that the Knicks are much better.  In fact they're much worse.
