Hmm...the plot thickens around here.  Our esteemed leader, the "Ice Queen," as I call her has sent out letters to those of us on a certain committee stating the times of the interviews for the unfilled position.  What the Ice Queen failed to mention, is that we will not get paid for working that day if we choose to attend the interviews.  This is a low blow.  I only just managed to assuage The Green Man from making a beeline to the Ice Cave to voice his rabid disbelief at such a decision.  Is Mark worth $200.00 some odd dollars of my time?  In a word, YES!!!!
