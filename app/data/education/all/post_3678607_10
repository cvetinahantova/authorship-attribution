I appreciate John Kerry. I think he's great. I am watching the convention with my family. Campaign Promises. I don't care. I don't like Jorge Dubya Bush.Â  I think that John Edwards doesn't look 51. He is, however better looking than Kerry. That's nice. I understand that they have good hair. To be a President, is it necessary to look like a caricature of yourself? It's fun being a Democrat!
