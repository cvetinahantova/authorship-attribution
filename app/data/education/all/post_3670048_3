I am bored stiff!! I have been sitting in front of this infernal machine for hours on end for however many weeks straight.  This morning I took a little me time, kind of.  Roommates were out so I had the whole house to myself.  I think I stayed in bed untill noon watching Monty Python's Flying Circus on DVD.  Yes I know I am freak, I have the complete Flying Circus, as well as all four movies (And Now For Something Compleatly Different, Quest for the Holy Grail, Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life)  I also have the A&E biography, Live at the Hollywood Bowl and several other live appearances by the group, in addition to countless CDs.  Yes I know I have a problem. Yes I know I need help. (the fact that I have the Dukes of Hazzard and 6 seasons of Buffy (season 7 won't be out till the fall I think) on DVD should clue you in to the fact that I really need to be commited. Well I am bored, I think I'll go to the gym and run a few errands. I may write later, I may not.  Who knows?
