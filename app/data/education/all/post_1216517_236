Hey, I'm finally connected to the virtual porch. However, I am wondering if the conversations will be as lively without the assistance of cigarettes and beer. This will probably be better for everyone. Smoking and drinking are bad habits, and I don't mean habits in the Catholic way. I mean consistent behaviors. Goodnight.  Matt
