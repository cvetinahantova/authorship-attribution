of course i've been observing so many cultural and sociological quirks.  maybe writing about them will legitimize my staring in some way.  [i figure it's fair since they stare at me.]  -the old folks here are so flexible.  they squat, in positions i can't even assume, on the side of the road waiting for the traffic lights to change or just hanging out.  they also fold up like dolls to sit on stools and such.  years of tatami rooms and tai chi.  they're also bicycle riders well into their 80s it seems.  it creates a whole new breed of road rage, uh...sidewalk rage.  there are grannies who dismount their bikes at the first sign of oncoming traffic instead of steering around it.  their dismount is this bizarre maneuver i've been practicing where they balance on one pedal and cross their free leg behind them.  you'd just have to see it.  -and nearly 90%, literally, of all women are severely pigeon-toed.  to the point where it affects there gait and stride.  what is that all about.  even their tv and magazine models.  some sort of side-effect of their physiology...maybe their hips and pelvis are constructed quite differently than westerners.  i did read about their tampons being 'different'  [whatever that means].  or i could be over-theorizing.
