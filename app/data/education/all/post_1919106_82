Anime Halloween Madness   Eh... Not much out of the ordinary happening there that I can recount, apart from the  urlLink strange events  during  Petshop of Horrors . Of course, after anime is when the fun started. We went over to Carol & Amber's for dinner, and decided that we were lazy, so we ordered pizza. Cyrus was nice and paid for all of it. We watched something... Can't recall what. Then Charles took Tracy and Jeff home, and we started talking about crazy stuff, and somehow (don't ask me, I wasn't involved in it) the conversation drifted towards dolphin sex, and someone pulled up a website about it, and Cyrus read  all of it , including the part about dolphins being able to wrap their penis around things, so now the word is out that he has dolphin penis envy.
