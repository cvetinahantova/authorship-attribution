::hums this song, slowly drifting off into his lands of thoughs, sitting in a wakeful sleep, absorbing the world as it flows around::  I close my eyes and I keep seeing things; Rainbow waterfalls, sunny liquid dream Confusion creeps inside me raining doubt; Gotta get to you, But I don't know how  Call me, Call me Let me know it's alright Call me, call me Don't you think it's 'bout time Please won't you call and  * Ease my mind  Reasons for me to find you Peace of mind What can I do, to get me to you *  I had your number quite some time ago Back when we were one But I had to grow Ten thousand years I've searched it seems and now Gotta get to you Won't you tell me how  Call me, Call me Let me know you are there Call me, call me I wanna know you still care Come on now won't you  * Repeat *  Ease my mind Reasons for me to find you Peace of mind Reasons for living my life Ease my mind Reasons for me to know you Peace of mind what can I do, to get me to you   ^That song...it makes me feel alot at ease...it also makes me feel closer to certain people. ::raises two fingers:: For a fine day of not many troubles, and a happy time with many people, even Ebil Ebil, (heh) I bid you all, good night/day.
