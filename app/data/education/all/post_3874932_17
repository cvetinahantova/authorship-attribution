A million years ago we talked about studying online senior communities. We could analyze thread data (assuming there is any relating to our topics). This might help us for now and/or lead into the more pointed inquiry about tech optimism and curiosity etc.  I've seen some active discussions on WebMD and Healthboards about various conditions relating to older people. The people posting claim to be our cohort of interest. I'm not sure what we can parse out regarding seniors interests in medical information and curiosity, cosmopolitanism, etc. There might be more tech/internet use-oriented message boards out there. Should we take a look-see? If there are insights to be had for free - cool. Though I do like the idea of more money to study exactly what we want to know.
