I was just trying to squish a mosquito who was trying to steal my blood (my cache of deliciousness) and I hit the creature with my sketch book. I looked on the back of the book and there was this horrible bloody mess. I was shocked that a small creature could leave behind so many entrails. Well, it turns out that it was only jam (don't ask). I hit the thing a second time and hurrah, the beast has been slain! I was disappointed at the scene though. I was expecting some sort of massacre... but no, just a very small body, free of its mind and limbs.   Gawd.
