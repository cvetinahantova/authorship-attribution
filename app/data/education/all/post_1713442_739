Every site is reviewed by editors before it is allowed in the directory.  New editors have all their work vetted by senior editors and not a lot of spam or junk gets into the database.  As such, the Joeant category for presidents has some good content and is  worth visiting.  (And if you want to add some sites, sign up as an editor and get to work!)
