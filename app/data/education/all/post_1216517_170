I am "teaching" an 8th grade class at Hillview Middle School and I have to piss like a Russian race horse.  I drank a crap load of coke at lunch, and cups and cups of coffee throughout the day.  I'm going to die.  There's still 30 minutes left in class. We're watching "The Diary of Anne Frank."  THis is the 3rd times I'm seen it today. Oh man.  Too much coke.  I'm dead.  I'm going to pee all over the classroom.  This sucks.  I'm never going to drink coke again.  I hate it.  It's dumb.  Why would anybody drink that crap.  What a stupid dummy dumb dumb drink.  AGHHHH!!!
