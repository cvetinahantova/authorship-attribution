A businessman recently asked a philosophy professor who received his fellowship with particular grace, "Why do academics hate people like me?"  Everyone knows that philsophers, historians, and aesthetes pride themselves on eschewing material gain.  Since about 1980, academics in the humanities also pride themselves on rallying the Left, decrying the military, and shooting down big business.  One possible reason for the acidity of these positions is the gradual decay of other positions for Leftists.  Historian Ellen Schrecker has shown how McCarthyism effectively demolished a Leftist professional struggle in the State Department during the 1950s, sending most radicals into local politics, organizing, or academia.  Legal scholar Richard Posner describes how Republican appointments of the 80s stuffed the courts with Republicans, leaving the brightest Democrats no choice but teaching to act as public servants.   And once an institution is formed, it tends to replicate itself.    The deeper effects of a recalcitrant university as the primary organ of education in America are worth thinking about.
