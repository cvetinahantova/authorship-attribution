we've got tumbleweeds traversing synapses arid neurologically speaking and yet the fiction makers keep spitting out scripts and we keep lapping them up like our taste buds didn't shrivel up long ago from the pabulum  thirsting for a drink and famished for a meal we get artificial calories in familiar originality from a roomful of short attention spans we get bursts of inspiration without any perspiration and steady by degrees we agree to dummy it down  such a pretty production pedestrian passersby with averted eyes and arsenals of excuses for why they get up each day to return to the same stage always a handful of #'s away from winning the lottery  and always secretly  welcoming any audience to read their yard sale paperback autobiographies that will pretend that they are interested to sit through this long tiresome releasing of sequels   Â©2003 DC Vision
