There is nothing beyond the blazing of the third eye, the fire that incorporates divine feminine and divine masculine in a unique combination that equals a perpective and a nuance of feeling complete in itself.  Not reaching out for more of one than the other, never shedding fully the clothes of imeasurable quantity, not knowing the depths of microness, nor the vastness of universalities, in each way expecting nothing and receiving everything in return: the eternal gift that circumscribes all of the components of an organic machine that eats cosmology and shits astrology.
