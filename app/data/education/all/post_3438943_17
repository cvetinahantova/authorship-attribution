Once a preschool teacher I have come so far from the enjoyment I once found in children.  As of late my favorite thing to do it watch a kid throw a tantrum in the store.  Sitting near kids in a restaurant- out of the question.  Babysitting that used to be a great way to make some extra cash- not so much.  Don't get me wrong I'm not to the point where I hate kids- still think I'll want at least one later in my life.  Maybe I'm just in a selfish phase right now but kids are money and work and time.  I much prefer the cats I have now.  I can decide not to go home- even for a couple of days they are fine as long as they got food, water and a fresh box.   They give back to you too and they don't require all that much.  Maybe its because people rely on my so much for stuff that I enjoy having a relationship that requires very little from me.  Hopefully I'm not destined to be an old cat lady- but I think I understand them a bit better.  I guess I also crave a stimulating enviornment- don't get me wrong kids can come up with amazing things most adults would never even think of.  Guess I'm just enjoying the adult world and at this point I'd be okay with not having kids of my own.  I think my way of thinking is better than the type who want a kid but doesn't realize the commitment and such that it takes.  Final not having a kid is not a way to strengthen a marriage- don't do it.
