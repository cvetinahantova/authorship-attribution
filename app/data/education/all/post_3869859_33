From an email sent to all of the employees at NASA Ames. The acronym cracks me up!  TO:    Resident Staff  FROM:   G. Scott Hubbard, Center Director  SUBJECT:   Prohibition on Feeding Pigeons due to Air Strike Hazard  Feeding pigeons and other wildlife causes over population, creating an imbalance in their natural habitat.  This imbalance not only threatens wildlife, but can also present serious dangers to humans.  There are now large flocks of pigeons at Moffett Field that increase the likelihood of collisions with aircraft, and risk the loss of human life.  Recently Moffett Field experienced two severe Bird Air Strike Hazard (BASH) incidents from flocks of domestic pigeons.  On the weekend of July 10th, a Navy 737 and a California Air National Guard C-130 struck flocks of pigeons at the airfield.  The 737 sustained considerable engine damage while the C-130 sustained both engine and airframe damage with an estimated cost of $1.6 million.  Every year aircraft are downed in the United States and throughout the world from bird strikes, in some incidents causing fatalities.
