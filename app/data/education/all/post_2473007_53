Sunlight fades, and now decends the unnamed fear that haunts both mind and body with a horrible horror-untamed, unaccepted, believed and all essentially true.

Somewhere a stream is flowing and covering a dry, parched soul; and most surely that dry, parched soul is my own, and the sweet refreshing flow is beauty.
