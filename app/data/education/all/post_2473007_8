There is a mystery behind flickering neon signs;     The scent of saltwater and fish on the pallid air     Breathed out with an exasperated sigh     By a tired city. Drones, hums and rumbles laced with laughter,     So many noones screaming for attention yet     Absent of humanity; devoid of soul     Save one cry. Stale winds and gaping lights almost dry the tears     While bodies continue to move in the night and     Streetlights continue to change     Silently, mechanically. Death, life and heaven now abide in some other place,     Agreed by everyone and noone in particular     To remain extinct and unspoken     Or else denied. The house of cards cannot comprehend its makers frailty;     Swallowed up in the beauty of itself,     While a divine breath     Topples the deck. Mysterious is the wonder we have assembled     As reality lies in pieces on the desert floor.
