Another meet. I shouldn't have gone today. It was for underclassmen OR for people who don't usually score. I'm an underclass(wo)man but I have enough varsity points for two people so I didn't really need to go. I guess I just wanted to go and get out of practice.   Ryan and Alex were at the meet...but they sat with the Cougars like little bizznitches (homez). Coach Nelson went...even though the Juniors and Seniors were acting like idiots on Friday.   So I ran the mile...got a 6:22. Not a PR, but I've done worse. I ran the 800 too, and got a 2:54. Shanika got shoved and fell, which tripped a SP girl, which stopped their heat of the 800. Shanika was bleeding...lol...she did the 4x4 with me anyway. I'm not a sprinter...lol...but they didn't have enought people for the 4x4 cause everyone was ditching and stuff. So I ran. We got third place and I had a 1:16.  Looks like my report cards gonna have six As and two Bs. Good. Now my parents won't freak like they did when they saw my report card when I had Mrs. Mirabile.  Talent show is coming up soon. Amanda wants to sing while I play guitar. +shrug+  Hah! Chris was singing this seventies TV show theme song when I got home...I love Chris!    Secret Agent Man! Secret Agent Man! They've given you a number, And taken away your name.  Beware of pretty faces that you find... A pretty face can hide an evil mind! Be careful what you say, Or you'll give yourself away. Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow.    Still playing Another Brick in the Wall prt. 2 though. Yay.
