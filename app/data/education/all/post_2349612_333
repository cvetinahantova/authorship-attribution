in order to not get a ticket (it's now illegal to talk on the phone whil driving in jersey unless you have a handsfree device), lara just purchased one of said handsfree devices...    dilemma 1: lara is so used to talking with and playing with her phone while talking that it's going to be quite the effort to remember to use said hand free device   dilemma 2:  lara charged this, as she's doing with most of her life this summer on account of not really getting paid for july and august... money makes me sad :-(
