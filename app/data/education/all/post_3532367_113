Set off early today and got in for 07:45. The traffic wasn't too bad at that time, but a lot of people struggled in late due to the major roadworks on the M6. The office is quite subdued at the moment, with 2 out of the 4 being in a foul mood. Sandra has had the day off today with suspected chicken pox!!!  Oh the joys! We had sex last night too. Nothing to shout home about, just trying to keep a record. She cryed afterwards and I felt empty, devoid of feeling - it wasn't nice. I will try and get hold of Relate today or tomorrow.
