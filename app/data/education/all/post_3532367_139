This is just a total nightmare. I've come back to a desk full of clutter, as it's been used as a dumping ground for the last week. My line manager is just being his normal rude arrogant self and he is unhappy with my attitude towards him. Things got worse this afternoon as my manager decided that rather than discussing things with me, he would go and tell the directors..... good management skills there eh?
