Dear Journal, Josh gave me a great idea tonight on how I could earn some money. He was talking about calling places to see if one can still get paid to give blood, and plasma. He says to me, “Amy, you could sell your eggs; they pay like $2000.00 for them.” So, I have a project; search around for a fertility clinic around here, call and get info on it. I’m also going to search blood and plasma banks as well. And it’s not just about the money, because there are people out there in dire need of these things. Money is just a plus! Well, I found some listings. Also, I found the phone number and address of one Ms. Mary McFatter, Billy’s mom. 612 East Main Street, Haw River, NC 27258. One way or another, I’m going to nail that bastard!! I also found an email address for a Don Springer. Going to check it out tomorrow.  urlLink GoBothWays@juno.com  Hey, it could happen.
