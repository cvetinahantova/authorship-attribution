Chabon is a Fraud         By IJ  Mousetrap and I were partying this weekend and he asked me if I have enjoyed my two years at Iowa.  Because I was drunk, I was able to say that what has been most useful about Iowa is the manner in which I have learned new ways to hold my writing to a higher standard.    The thinking, for me, is this: to be a better writer, really, is to be able to find more problems in your writing that are worth fixing and fixing them.  There is no treatment without the diagnosis.   Being at Iowa has, concurrent to battering my ego, improved my writing by making me like it less.  Over time, this has begun to lead, and one hopes will continue to lead, back not only to liking it, but to liking it on something closer to its actual merits which, one also hopes, are on the rise as well.  An immediate side effect is how I read books now.  Before I came to Iowa, it would have been fair to call me a  urlLink Michael Chabon  fan.  I read two of his novels the summer before I came to Iowa and I started a third last night, now that I am more than eighty percent done with my degree.  And I don't love it.  I am ambivalent to the neat metaphors, and I find myself tripping over the words that grow like weeds in each sentence, there only to make the voice more mannered when really, it is plenty mannered without them.  The long digressions might as well be covered in dew, the reader's reaction to them is so obviously engineered.  Now, I love writers like  urlLink Katherine Anne Porter  and  urlLink Jose Saramago , not because they are somehow more perfect than writers like Chabon (btw-The common criticism that Iowa produces "perfect" fiction is silly but based in a marginally related truth, a topic for another time).  I like them because they find ways to make their writing invisible, completely in service to the content.  The writers I like now don't walk a tightrope to make the reader ooh and ah like Chabon might think he is doing.  They walk the tightrope because on the otherside is something of interest, emotional and intellectual, like a baby tied up in dynamite, crying crying crying for its uncle Jose.  (Ferlighetti can go fuck himself for thinking of  urlLink this  stupid metaphor first).
