A Riot of My Own    urlLink When Joe Strummer suggested it , it seemed pretty cool, a cry for individualist action, a rebellion against middle class complacency and knee-jerk values.  But when white kids actually do riot?   urlLink Over  and  urlLink over ,  urlLink it's just a bunch of dumbasses being dumbasses .  Let's not underestimate the role of Iowa in all this.  I can say that because I live and teach there.  If Iowa is the blandest common denominator of this country, then it's young people could perhaps be our truest cross-section (without that distracting factor of truly urban life that has apparently skewed me and my peers into what George Bush would call "an elite," though it's a little odd to be simultaneously elite and really poor).    These kids have the energy to riot, which is great, but really pointless without the motivation that must accompany it.  They just want to break shit, and they are so prematurely cynical about the world that they don't even pretend to have a reason to break said shit.  These kids don't even have the solace of punk rock, because even that has been  urlLink commodified  and  urlLink sold  to them en masse.  And anyway, they couldn't all be punk rockers, right?
