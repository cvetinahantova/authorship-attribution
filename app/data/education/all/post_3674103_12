i've decided that i really hate alcohol. maybe it just doesn't mix with me well. i really don't know. i like the idea of having a couple drinks to just relax from my crazy week, but i would much rather have other means of relaxation (which are not available in the super conservative country that is south korea).  i think it might have to do with the basic nature of alcohol. i mean, i choose to ingest this small amount of poison in order to slightly poison myself to feel happy and relaxed. at the same time, i'm hoping that my body will be able to dispel this poison before it makes me sick or kills me (while i bitch about the amount of times i have to piss when i drink also). it doesn't make much sense to me i guess.  however, i'll probably continue my weekend drinking (i've forced myself to drink only on the weekends due to some rough days at work which followed some crazy nights at the bars). i'll have my few beers (you can buy these re-sealable plastic pitchers of beer here, they are huge and great), or my gin and fanta (fanta, for those of you out of the loop, is kind of like an orange pop thing). maybe i'll eventually get someone to mail me some seeds or something.
