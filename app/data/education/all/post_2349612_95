hungarian for star party!  dude  so went star finding again for an hour to an hour and a half again tonight... way freezing cold, but way clear, and an incredible night for actually finding stuff.  ask me more about this in a week, but suffice it to say, stargazing just got 100 million times better than before!  the end
