If you haven’t seen the news, these two link, one to the Israeli paper  urlLink Ha’aretz  (The Land) and the  urlLink NY Times , should bring you up to speed regarding the bombing that took place Sunday morning. This is the start of the work week, and a lot of soldiers head back to their bases via the bus system.    The blast was in the southern part of Tel Aviv, while the Tal Hotel and the other places we visited in Tel Aviv are in the northern part.   Now for my opinions: I’m angry about this, especially now that I know individuals who live in Israel. I trust they are all safe, and that the Jess and Mike are also safe (I doubt they were even awake at that 7am hour). This comes two days after the UN’s Internal Court of Justice ruled that the Separation Fence which Israel is building, is illegal and that countries should consider measures to punish Israel if the fence isn’t torn down. Where is the ruling and the recommendations that punish the Palestinians for such bombings?   If there were no terrorism, there would be no fence.  But you say if there was no occupation there would be no terrorism?  There would be no occupation if the Palestinians had leaders dedicated to peace.    It is a vicious stalemate Israel is in. I wish there was strong enough leadership somewhere in the world to figure out a way to break it.
