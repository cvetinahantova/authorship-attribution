Sandra moaned at me again this morning for not helping get the kids to school. I've tried to explain that I owe nearly 3 hours to work, so have to get in early to make the time up. In the next breath she is telling me about school assemblies and sports days - more time off needed! I also have a school meeting next week and I need to get time off for that too. I didn't pester again last night - thatâ€™s twice in a row now - small steps forward from my point of view (expected from Sandra's). I bet reading this back makes me sound like a sex pest!
