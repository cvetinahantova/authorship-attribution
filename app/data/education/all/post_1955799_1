I've been lazy, and I don't feel a bit guilty for it.  With classes and my job, I just wanted to rest my nerves.  I did get the rest, had pizza, and watched some not so great movies, but the point was I enjoyed my free time.  LOL.  I did have the pesky task of mowing my lawn before any chilling could begin.   The front lawn is always the hardest.  The worst part is between the bushes and the ditch.  Not enough room to manuver.
