Ah, Valentine's Day. For some, a blissful reminder of their love for one another, a chance to celebrate the fact that they have found true happiness and an excuse for great sex. For others, it's a sharp, painful reminder of the lack of decent, trustworthy men in the world, a chance to wallow in your own self-pity and an excuse to buy a lot of alcohol.   I have no objection to couples; when I hear about new couples I always wish them well and I do genuinely hope that each party is happy, but there's always that voice in the back of my mind saying "How come all these people have partners and I don't? What's wrong with me?". If I ever voice these concerns, the standard reply comes back: "Don't worry Jess, you're gorgeous and it'll happen to you soon blah blah blah dreamy girly speak". I'm sure it will, I think one day I will find some wonderful man who really respects me, and it doesn't even have to be a boyfriend, just a man who wants to be affectionate and friendly, even fatherly. I just wish he'd hurry up and make himself obvious, because it seems like I'm getting left behind...  Ceff x   I'm not your star... Isn't that what you said?
