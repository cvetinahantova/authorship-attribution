I've been remiss in posting for a good while now due to the tumult and exhaustion of moving. But here we are, back in the greater Boston metropolitan area, and here I am, back on the blog. Mostly, both big Al and I are suprememely disoriented and tired and discombobulated. But slowly, the reality that this is our home is sinking in. A few observations:   I went for a walk at dusk last night and caught a whiff of subtley but distinctively salt-water-scented air. That was nice.  Not that I have anything against the smell of manure, but, you know.   There are a lot more Kerry than Bush bumper stickers on cars here. But a lot more cars in general, and they move a helluva lot faster and more frantically.   A much larger percentage of the young women around town -- and this I find especially comforting after two years of being surrounded by spray-on-tan, midriff-baring, bottle-blonde Iowa undergrads -- are curvy and pale and wear cool clothes. Less makeup, too. (Foundation? What's that?)   Our car insurance is going to cost us twice as much. Mother fuck.   I can hear church bells from our house when the windows are open.   I miss our herb garden, and all the blue jays and cardinals in our old backyard. But I really like being able to get good takeout Indian food, which we had the other night.   I miss all of you guys, but I'm sure as hell glad not to be in the Workshop anymore.    In any case, we have an absurdly huge apartment, so please let us know if you're ever nearby and need a place to crash. (That goes for you, too, FBI guy....)
