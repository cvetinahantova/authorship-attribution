I willingly let people into my heart.  I welcome them.  I make them feel at home.  And then they leave.  Or they hurt me in ways I didn't know possible.  And then leave.  Why do I continue to do this?  Why do I continue to have faith in human beings when I continue to get crushed?  You'd think I'd learn.  And I do, for a small period of time.  And then something happens.  I start to think "well, maybe this one is different."  At times I feel like I give and give, and my friends just take and take.  Is this friendship?  Why would you intentionally hurt a friend?  Even if you've gone through some bad times, I don't see the need for continual pain.  You cared about that person at one point in time.  How does that love just disappear?  How can you turn your back on someone you loved?  And how do those of us that love so deeply, few that we may be, heal from all these losses?  How do we learn to love again, and learn to be proud of our big hearts?
