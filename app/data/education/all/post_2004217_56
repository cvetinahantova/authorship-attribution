I take it all back. Fuck father-daughter interaction. I wanna go home, now.   Once more, it is a Friday night and I am on the internet, talking to my friends at HOME, away from my REAL family, while Em, Dad and Wicked Stepmother have a gay old time in the living room listening to Bon Jovi. Bon fucking Jovi. The acoustic album, no less. Could it get any worse? Well, yes. The subject of money could come up. The fact that, despite all our best efforts to conduct legal proceedings regarding maintenance in a civil, neutral manner, he still decides to ring up the CSA (Child Something Agency) and claim that he can't afford to pay a poultry Â£143 per month for my keep. Thanks a fucking bunch Dad, You tell me I'm the most important thing in the world to you, that you love me more than anyone else in your life, and then you try and make me feel as worthless as possible, financially and emotionally. On top of that, this stupid cheap internet connection keeps cutting out, leaving me marooned, sniffling and with a sore throat, with nothing but The Early November and Kerrang! for company. Rock and Roll...  But, on a lighter note, and I will try to make it light (promise), Zeb's party last night was very good. There weren't as many people there as I expected, but it was still a highly amusing evening for the following reasons:  1. The buffet consisted entirely of sweets and vodka jelly shots 2. The stripper was ugly, tubby and had a Teeny Peeny 3. The outfits were highly amusing 4. I Had drinks but didn't get drunk 5. I danced enough to feel I had balanced the effects of eating lots of sweeties from the buffet  Unfortunately my chirpyness this morning was destroyed by my choking on a throat lozenge in the car on the way to school, leaving me breathless and with a sharp pain in my chest; thankfully the pain subsided after a while but the tiredness remained for the rest of the day. Rock and Roll...  Ceff x   Do you regret your loneliness?
