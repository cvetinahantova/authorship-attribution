Bzzzz.   Silence.   Bzzzzz.   "Oh, damnit," said Dex as he leaned over the bed, looking for his cell phone which was the cause of the mood-ruining buzzing.    A few feet from the bed still stood Catrina.  Once a vision of sensual beauty, Catrina now looked dejected, even annoyed. She pulled the sheet around her shoulders.  She was cold now, but not as cold as the icy stare she was now projecting at Dex.  Dex slid out from under the covers, still listening intently to whoever was on the end of the line, his brow furrowed.  He stood up, his rippling muscles backlit from the moon.  He began searching for his clothes.  Catrina poured herself a glass of wine.  There were two glasses on the bedside table, but she knew that tonight only one of them would be put to use.  "I will be there as soon as I can."  Dex ended the conversation, and slid the cell phone around the waistband of his jeans.  Catrina hated the look of cell phones on waistbands, and she was just about to say so, when. . .  "I've got to go."  Dex looked at Catrina with disappointed eyes.  The rest of his features, though, were strong and determined.
