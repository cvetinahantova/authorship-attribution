I am all pumped up to see Matrix: Revolutions tomorrow.  So I decided to start reading online reviews.  Not a good idea.  The critics are tearing it apart.  But still I know I will enjoy it.  The plan is to meet and eat bbq and then hit the movie.  After the movie hopefully there will be a lot of drinking involved.  I guess I really don't have a whole lot to say.  I chilled out downtown a tonight.  Nothing special just got some food and sat in Seattle's for a bit.  Oh I did get a winter hat that I will be able to pull over my eyes so I won't be waking up at the ass crack of dawn all the time.  I've still got to go to immigration at some point.  No doubt Scott has forgotten.  I should call him or something.  I don't want to find out what happens if I don't get my card within 90 days.  Granted I do have a fair amount of time until then but best to get it out of the way.  Ok that's it.
