Tommy is a fx trader in his spare time.  FX trading is lind of like trading with the stock market, but it is with foreign exchange-different currencies instead of stocks.  So he has to watch the charts all the time for the currency he is trading in.    To do this, he has been sleeping on the couch in the living room, where he can set his laptop up and watch the stuff during the night, when it does a lot of trading.   For the past two nights, we have moved our mattress into the living room floor so we could sleep together instead of in different rooms.  I am so glad we have.  It is a hassle as far as making the bed every night, and then having to clean everything up every morning, a King size mattress is not easy to move.  But, I would rather deal with the hassles than sleep in two different rooms.  Especially with the stress we have been under.
