Ok, so my mouth has a mind all its own.  This morning, it breaks out in canker sores!  What in the world do I have to be stressed about in the summer, when I am not taking classes and work is so boring that I sometimes find myself just staring out into space, day-dreaming, for hours at a time (well, maybe not hourS, just an hour at the most, but still, that's long enough)???  What do I daydream about, you ask???  hehe.  My Hummer!  My future house.  My future job.  Next semester, when I will be a true Engineering student for a change.  I even spend time thinking about the past.  YES, I do mean high school, etc.  As much as I HATED life at FHS, I do think about that time of my life.  That is how slow it is at work.  BUMMER.  It turns out that a girl I work with went to high school with my sis, and she has been asking if I knew this person or that, and it just gets me to reminiscing...about HELL!  Yeah, it sucked.
