urlLink Elementary School Blog :  This is another blog I have became aware of recently.  It is written by Norma Jean Smith who is a school librarian in Austin, Texas.  It is very well done.  It focuses on professional sites for primary grade teachers.  She has pegged a few library related sites as well.  My oldest son is in elementary school now so I have an new found interest in the primary grade levels and find this to be a good read.
