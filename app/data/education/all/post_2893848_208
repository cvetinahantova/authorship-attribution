Trust Phil Collins    I was wondering when our resident Impeccable Historian Emeritus would weigh in on Colonial House.  Drew, I'm glad you took the bait.  We seem to agree on a lot of points  (which makes me feel smarter and more informed than I probably am).  But in particular, two things seem worth highlighting: 1)  this isn't "History" anymore than Survivor is "Game Theory" and 2)  Bethany is a real fox.  Okay, and 3) the real value of this show is not in what it purports to be, but in the social psychology of the project: The psychology of reenactment is more interesting than the reenactment itself.  The actor trumps the character; the artifice trumps the content; the Baptist trumps the Puritan.  Perhaps this is the only potential strength of any reality television:  the layering of artifice and the negotiation that occurs between these layers within and between participants.  This isn't as solid a strength as, say, those that attend truth and its pursuit, and I think that it is our cultural tendency to inflate the value of overdetermination.  (Why should multiple but thin layers of meaning be nore thrilling than one, as thick as an iceberg?)  Nonetheless, this is the world we live in (oh oh oh)and these are the hands we're given (oh oh oh), so it's worth valuing Colonial for what it does better than any of its competition.     After all, if I really wanted to learn about colonial America, I wouldn't watch TV.  I'd read a book.  I'd talk to Drew, or, if I was particularly ambitious, I would consult with primary documents.  Contrary to the claims of sundry cable networks, TV isn't the most efficient way to learn  (in fact, so much of "informative" programming seems designed to provide as little information as possible while simultaneously maintaining the illusion of providing more).  But TV is one hell of a conduit for drama, and drama is nothing if not psychology under pressure.
