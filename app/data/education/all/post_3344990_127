Miracles NEVER cease to happen folks!  The Dallas Cowgirls have morphed back into the Dallas Cowboys in my mind.  I have been watching this team play (or attempt to play) NFL football since the late 1960's.  Yes, I was born in 1961 so that means I have been watching them for most of my life.  I am not much of a sports enthusiast but thanks to my dads interest in the team he got me hooked at a tender age.    It appears that Bill Purcell is whipping this franchise into a formidable opponent to reckon with.  We shall see how they do when they face Tampa Bay next week down in Tampa Bay Florida.    Go DALLAS !!  5 wins and 1 loss which means that they are NUMBER ONE in the NFC East for the first time in how many years?     urlLink
