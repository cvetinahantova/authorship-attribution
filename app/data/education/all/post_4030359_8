Last. This is the last blog I will ever write at this office. This is the last attempt for me to appear busy at the computer, while all the while doing nothing. This is the last attempt to speak Japanese and listen attentively while not really understand what REALLY happened. This is the last time to watch the Japanese teachers run around the teacher's room in a frenzy. This is the last time I sweat profusely while doing nothing. This is the last time I knock people over to get to the bathroom in hopes of getting the Western style toliet. This is the last time I bow to people. The last time I say Ohayo Gozaimasu. The last I pray for the clock to go to 4PM.  Yeah, there are a lot more lasts, but do I really need to get all sappy at the computer? The people here have been so nice, nicer than they should have been. I ma so thankful for getting the opportunity to be here. We only get one chance to get away, before we are tied down by family...eventually...I couldn't have asked for a better experience.... Iijo desu. That's all, folks.
