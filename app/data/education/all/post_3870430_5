Hi all,  I think we've done pretty well to get this far without a major problem. However, we have had a problem, and now I'd like to get it solved. As you know, the blogs are a public forum, and therefore I will explain the problem publically.  The problem is our first major breach of the rules. Specifically, Tom has left an offensive post on Peter's blog. In the post, Peter was attacked personally and described offensively. For this, Tom has received a strike.  Here is the comment I left in response to Tom's:    Hi Peter (and everyone else reading this blog)  As I'm sure you know, Tom's comment here breaks the rules we have established. Calling someone a "dick" is disrespectful and offensive, and because of this, Tom has received a strike. Two more strikes and he will fail the blog assessment.  I have left Tom's comment up as an example of how not to communicate. Tom, I'm sure you had something you wanted to say here, but you used the wrong language to express it. I will discuss this with you next class.  Zoe   I hope that you will agree that this issue has been dealt with fairly, and is now finished with.  Zoe
