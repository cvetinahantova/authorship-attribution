Dear Journal,             Okay, so I’m depressed.  Big deal!  I’m always depressed!  But it’s different this time.  This time there’s reasons. 1) Is April 26th and 2) is May 4th.  Here I am once again unable to buy my kids something for their 1st and 5th birthdays! I don’t know how to fix me anymore.  I used to devise plans and schemes to do something about my problems.  But now I just want to cry and feel pity upon myself.  I’ve been cut off from the world for so long, I don’t even know what I’d do in it anymore.  And, here lately, whatever anyone (mostly Mama) says to me, I always take it like they’re calling me stupid.  I feel stupid, I feel retarded, disabled to the point where I don’t know myself anymore.  Sometimes I wonder what Mama’s thinking.  I wonder why she puts up with me.  I clean fairly well and watch the kids, but I do nothing to help her out; I support nobody, nothing.  Sometimes I wish she’d yell at me!  Make me do something; make me WANT to do something!  Make me drive when we go somewhere!  Make me get off my fat ass and find a job.  I suppose that wouldn’t work either; then I’d just hate myself even more for letting her, AGAIN!
