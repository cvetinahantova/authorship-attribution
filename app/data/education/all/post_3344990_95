This week is being spent getting things back into shape around the house.  We still have multiple boxes sitting around the house begging to be unloaded.  The job search is continuing and I have managed to clean up a majority of the jungle that was surrounding us on all sides.  It has been HOT HOT HOT here.  Whew, you would think I lived in Afghanistan.  Ok, maybe it has not been quite that hot but it has been pretty steamy here.   I went to hear Pastor Bob Gray at Trident Baptist Church on Monday and Tuesday.  The key message from Dr. Gray was on soul winning.  I have a five page sermon outline for those of you that are interested in digging into what the word of God has to say about that.    We are getting ready to go to Grace Fellowship for the monthly pot luck dinner which will be SO Yummy...
