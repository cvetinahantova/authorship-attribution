So I went to the beach today with alyssa and carina from about 11-3:30. It was really hot there. Guess what?! I actually went out deep, like over my head (for a little while) it was funny, I kept on asking alyssa if she could touch the ground because I didn't want to go out farther than where she couldn't touch. I was so afraid of the ocean before today, but now I'm okay with it. oh and I got sunburned on the backs of my legs really bad. My face and back are a tiny bit sunburned but they might be more because it takes a while for you to see if you really got sunburned. hey-that means i'll have a tan and i won't be ghost white! lol. um I can't thnk of anything else to say so I'm going to go take a shower and put aloe vera all over my legs and face. bye!
