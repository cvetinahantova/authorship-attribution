I would be in a good mood today if it weren't for the pain I've been in all week.  I have so many mildish things wrong with me that people have occasionally accused me of being a hypochondriac.  Before you go down that lane a let me give you this: hyÂ·poÂ·chonÂ·driÂ·a    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (hp-kndr-) n.  The persistent conviction that one is or is likely to become ill, often involving symptoms when illness is neither present nor likely, and persisting despite reassurance and medical evidence to the contrary. Also called hypochondriasis.  Plural of hypochondrium.  Now the differance between me and that is that I acctually have medical evidence of my problems.  Really I'm just tired of people laughing at me when I tell them something is wrong.    This was not what I intended to go off on though.  I was really think of the bad old day's when I was still in Highschool.  I don't want to go back to that, it's just that I miss the daily contact with my friends.  Now we're scattered all over the world.  In ten more days I'm going to be going back to my home town.  In another month I'll see an old friend I haven't seen in nine years.
