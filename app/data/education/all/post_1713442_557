urlLink Supporting Early Literacy Development in Family Child Care Settings. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Lu Mei-Yu.  It looks how child care providers can help children learn to read.  From the ERIC Digest:  The purpose of this Digest is to provide information for family child care providers regarding children's early literacy development. A definition and the characteristics of family child care are discussed in the first part of this Digest, while the second half focuses on research-based strategies and recommendations that help support early literacy development for children enrolled in family child care settings.   With growing numbers of mothers entering the work force, the need for out-of-home child care has increased dramatically in the last two decades (O'Neill & O'Connell, 2001). A recent survey by Capizzano, Adams, & Sonenstein (2000) reveals that approximately 3/4 of American children under age 5 with employed mothers are cared for by someone other than their parents during the day; and among these children, 1/5 were enrolled in family child care. Although family child care is one of the most commonly used out-of-home child care arrangements, little research is available regarding children's early literacy learning and development in such settings (Cress, 2000). As the acquisition of written language skills is critical to children's later academic success, it is important to explore how family child care providers can develop sound literacy programs as well as create literacy-rich environments that support children's early literacy development.
