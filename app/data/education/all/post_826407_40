Si put this on  urlLink his blog , so I nicked it.  Its very cool.  I AM I need a new idea. I AM What works? I AM What's the latest thing? I AM Nothing's real anymore. I AM If we fail, who will take the message to the nations? I AM Leader's are dropping like flies, who will last? I AM Kids today deserve more. I AM I'm going under, somebody help me! I AM I'm pouring into others, whose pouring into me? I AM Nobody's listening to me. I AM I'm not sure whose on my team. I AM I can't hold it together. I AM Who can I trust? I AM I'm not sure it's worth it anymore. I AM My vision's bigger than my budget, howï¿½'s it going to happen? I AM All I do is never enough. I AM I quit. I AM I can't. I AM I need a drink. I AM I need a fix. I AM Somebody just hold me. I AM I am not, but I know I AM.  2002 Louie Giglio. All rights reserved.
