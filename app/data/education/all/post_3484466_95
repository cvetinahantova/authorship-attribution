Yeah, now I've got 4 clients going, and it was pretty much error free and easy-going. Of course, there was a power failure on one half of the room, so all we had running for a little bit was our 3 servers, the 4 WinXP computers, and the class server, which is run by Mr. P Anyway... not much else going on, other than that. We're pretty much on the first test, now, after one last instructor check tomorrow. He kept rebooting the server for some reason, so we couldn't do much, because our servers are running as child domains of the central domain. I'll just say it wasn't helpful.  I'm going now, so yeah.  Current Music: Aliz√©e - A Contre-Courant
