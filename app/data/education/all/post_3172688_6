Hey!  I'm at school right now....Ohh, how fun. I only have about 15 mins left in class so this will be short. Anyways (background) I'm a 15 year old from Aberdeen Washington. Don't judge me yet just because I'm only 15. I mean a lot of people  do  tell me that I don't act my age (which isn't true sometimes but most of the time it is). I live in a nice little house with a lot of crazy people. I love to go bike-riding, skating, to the mall, and go hiking. I love to go to the beach and I  love  the rain. I already have my plans for the future all layed out for me but it might take a little longer than I had hoped. I mean I'm only a freshman in high school but I have already failed almost half my classes. I'm hoping to finish high school (even if I do have to become a 'special senior' once or twice), then after I finish with high school I'm hoping to go to Ashmead college and become a massage therapist and start (or work for) a company in Portland, Oregon. Anyways got to go. Bell is going to ring.
