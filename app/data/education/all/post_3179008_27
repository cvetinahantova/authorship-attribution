What a great weekend. Three wonderful days. I was able to neglect thinking about work for about 95% of the time. I did many physical and natural things. 4X4 ing up in the mountains... discovered a sweeet water hole. I'll be there again.  Now to the fun.  Last week, on Friday, one of the students in my class broke the window of the teacher in the other class ( more on her blog...maybe ). Anyway, that class was able to leave early for their outing. A positive way to look at being scared shitless fromm a dual-paned window being smashed into their room when they were quietly doing art-type work. It appears that the house in which the window-breaker lives neglected to give her her medication in the morning. Considering she is bipolar, and schizo a bit, that was not good. The straw that broke her back was seeing a return student, boy, that she had a crush on. Her head must have been a blender of thoughts and feelings.   Anyway, break time. More tomorrow, maybe.  D
