urlLink Students' Online Learning Experiences  This looks like a nice and interesting project from the UK.  From the site:  SOLE is a project to undertake an independent evaluation of students' usage of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in higher and further education and draw out the effectiveness of VLEs in supporting different subject areas, different national agendas (such as that of widening participation) and student learning in general.  Research is being carried out at several UK universities and FE colleges, covering a broad range of subjects with diverse online learning requirements. The collaborating LTSN subject centres involved as research partners are: Economics, Psychology, Education, Information and Computer Sciences, Hospitality, Leisure, Sport and Tourism. The project began in October 2002 and will run until March 2004. A wide range of dissemination and outreach activities are taking place throughout the life of the project.  SOLE is funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) via the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN) Tranche 2 initiative and the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC).  It is hosted at the Institute for Learning and Research Technology, University of Bristol.
