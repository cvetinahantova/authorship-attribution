I'm on the volcano w/out a car - long story short = expired license/no rente...  The humidity and tropical island flavor is great to experience once again.  I'm feeling ambivalent, but mostly taking in the slower pace forced upon me and enjoying the pool, beach, downtown, museums, cafes, etc.  I'm hoping to link up with some of the conference participants tomorrow or the next day and cut out early to get some things done back home.  It'll work out.  I might try to do a helicopter ride tomorrow if I can get a reservation.  I'll call later and see what the chances are.  That would be pretty cool - the weather's supposed to hold since tropical storm Darby blew through late yesterday.  Bye, bye bruddah!  (The pigeon english on the bus ride was interesting to me...).
