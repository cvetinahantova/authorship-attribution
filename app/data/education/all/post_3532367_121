We have a new person joining our team today. He is young and overly keen and of course has a lot to learn. A lot of the attention is focussed on him today, which should be a good thing. The problem is, his desk is next to mine, so it's like "New Street Station" here at the moment. I am finding it very unsettling.  I dont know why, but I seem to view everything as a problem, or look at the negative in daily situations or things I do. Today I feel down or as if the slightest thing is getting on top of me. I feel as though I am creating problems out of nothing.  I have just completed a training session (which I enjoyed) but I spent the latter part of it thinking about fishing. Buying a new rod and tackle and spending hours by a river bank. Is this a serious healthy interest or is it a fad to enable me to spend money so that I feel better in myself? Does anyone know? Oh I wish I could curl up and go to sleep.  I have to work on a "foreigner" when I finish today to network someone at home. It could take a while, but I can think of a hundred things I would rather be doing.
