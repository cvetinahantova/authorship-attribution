Let's work something out for the next time everyone will be home.  Between Ambur, Josh H, and Paige, it'd be nice to figure out when all three of them can do something next.  This is hard to do and I understand.  But I've been told that I suck at planning.  Well, maybe but I also don't have your schedules right in front of me.  I think instead of pointing out what I do wrong, point out that I am always trying to make things work no matter what.  Like Ambur, we've gone to see movies late for you many times.  So, Ambur, Josh Hall, Paige plus everyone else...look ahead so we can plan a time to just meet and hang out.
