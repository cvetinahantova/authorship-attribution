I spent 3 days of introduction to university life. Which was really cool. I meet a few people, made a few friends. And was extremely nervous at first. Now I can hardly wait for Monday to start! Not to mention all the eye candy ^.~  I won't be taking english this year it seems or the semester, depending on how many people are taking the  course. My sister said that if there were lots in waiting list, the might open a section. I hope so. That way I would only take this year of engllish since I already have 2 classes done of it because of the advance tests. A/W, I only have one class on Tuesday and Thursday. YAY! I'm SO EXITED TO START ALREADY!!!!!!!
