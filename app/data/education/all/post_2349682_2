I was in my intern class at San Tan this morning and it was interesting because the kids were just talking to me about everything you could imagine. We were doing centers and one little boy the only mexican in the class (vladimir) comes up and just hugs me, when I first met him I thought he didn't want anything to do with me, but today I was pleasantly surprised by his display of affection, I am almost in tears because it meant the world to me. And then a little while after that, he says, Ms. Cela I no no what I doing! He is a doll! OHH!I know he is just learning english but his accented english makes everything he says so cute! Another little girl told me that she was going to get a puppy, her parent's told her that she could. I asked her how long does it take to grow up? About twenty minutes she says matter of factly. If only that could be true! I've been asking for a puppy for awhile now, I am hoping for a christmas, birthday, graduation present with a puppy in a bow. I really want a Mastiff, but I know I have to be patience. The thing about a dog for me is that they demonstrate what unconditional love is all about, no matter what time you come home. They are loyal, great companions, they can protect you, and most of all they can be a part of the family. I am praying that someday I will get my Samson/Trinity whichever hopefully Samson. But until then I want to be thankful for what I do have: great parents, good school, great church, good jobs and a relationship with God.
