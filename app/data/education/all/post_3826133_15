And the more I think about it, the more okay I am with it.  See, I put down the ultimatimum that he had  x  amount of time to find a job or we were going to  pack our shit up and move.   I didn't know where I was going, but it would be far away and it would be not here with no (s)mother no step monster no Fucking Karen no  no no no no.  But I don't think I can get out of my house.  I don't think my grandmother (who cosigned on it with me) would appreciate me subletting it less than half a year after she was coerced into buying it.  i don't have money to relocate.  and i'm terrified of getting far far away with a man i love and having things not work out.  (gee, i wonder why i worry about these things?)
