Yesterday when I was with the boys I started feeling nauseated and I had to lie down for a bit. I didn't feel like eating because I didn't want to throw up. I hate throwing up. Anyways, I took a nap then called mom she came over and helped me eat but said I had lost color in my face. Well I was dizzy and feeling cold sweats too, I'm like what is this all about? After mom left I took Derek to basketball, I was feeling a little better but then it came back the sweats, my stomach was all twisted, well I didn't keep my lunch in to long, I fell asleep on the couch. Luckily the boys were great and they helped me out a little by putting in a movie, reading, and doing crafts. I felt bad because I wasn't giving my attention to them but I also just felt bad. So God is good because I was worried about picking up Derek from basketball, Anne (their mom) came home early and she told me to go home and rest.  Mom was a great nurse last night, she helped make me feel better. So when my dad called he told me that I am going through a withdraw from my medication. I told him today that I am so glad that I never did an illegal drug and was addicted to it because getting off of it is terrible!!!
