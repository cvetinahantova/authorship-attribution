I was going to write about how fucking upset I am right now, but the only thing that would come out was swear words, so I am going to write about a cool fact I heard the other day.  I will write about my frustration later when I have had some time to deal with it.    I was talking to Kerry the other night about how I think science makes things more interesting and beautiful, not less so.  There is an illusion with the moon that gives me goosebumps - when the moon is low, it appears to be really large, but if you hold up a dime or your thumb to it, you would find that it is the same size as when it is above you and looks small.  It's because people assume that the sky above them is closer than the sky at the horizon.  The brain reasons that if the sky at the horizon is further away, but the moon is the same physical size, then the moon at the horizon must be huge, and just translates that directly into the perception of a really large harvest moon.  I love that fact.  And whenever I see a harvest moon, I always point it out to people.  But my friends think I am ruining the beauty when I share these little facts.  I disagree.    Anyway, I heard a better one the other day:  When people are in love, looking into the eyes of their partner causes the pupils to dilate.  The dilation acts as re-inforcement for looking into each others eyes - it's like a physical manifestation of "I love you", which is why it is so rewarding to look at a person you are in love with.  I love that fact, too.  And I don't think it makes gazing into your lover's eyes less romantic - just the opposite.    Is anybody reading this?      I am going to watch The Notebook again sometime this week.
