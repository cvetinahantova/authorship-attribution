all weekend, over and over again, i've been thinking that one of the most poignant ways that our world feels broken is the dearth of storytelling.  we have ceded our attention and our voices to multimediaconglomerates....who, i do not feel simply angry toward.  i recognize that they are a product of desire, and that they have facilitated possibilities in storytelling that would not otherwise be possible, but...  so few people own stories which are their own.    so few people knit their lives together with others by using the shared experiences that they rehearse.  so few of us allow narrative sensitivity to guide our time instead of clocks, watches and "minutes" & "hours" (whatever those are...!)  and i?  i'm going to do something about it.  (stay tuned)
