How do you forget you have a blog?  I don't know but I did.  Anyway, I got my Sheriff's badge today from the re-election campain that says:   Wrangler  Re-elect  Bush  Cheney  2004  or something like that.  anyway, I wore it tonight out. I love it!  I can't wait for someone to make some snide comment...and I can knock them over by telling them I've already donated to his campaign and am about to again.  ha!  Anyway.  Been doing a lot of organizing before the family gets here next weekend.  My brother-in-law's wedding is on Saturday the 5th of June and my parents, brother, and sister-in-law will be here this coming Saturday or Sunday or something.  I got all the closets organized, the basement shelving unit fixed up so everything fits on it, the pantry organized, and ... and oh...laundry!  Tomorrow I'd love to get the valances for the family room done...or rather, re-done.  I did one and, according to J, it looks like a hotel room valance. :)  So much for doing them THAT way then. :) I'm trying to come up with another way to use the fabric I already used on this one without wasting it.  Let's see...anything else? School's done in 2 1/2 weeks...hooray!  Then I start summer school...taking a class twice a week for 4 hours.  I may also get to work for the Johnson's Wax daycare center this summer teaching their kindergarten and first graders French.  It should be fun :).  I get paid whatever I ask for...and I get to work as often as I want.  Hooray extra cash! :)  Well, I think I'm out of time.  Enjoy and have a good night.
