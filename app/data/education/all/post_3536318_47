Welp, I reinstalled the code for the comment thingies...   So, if you're one of the many (hah) that have been trying to leave comments, but were balked by the system, then, give it a whirl now.  Oh, one more thing... If you were unsuccesful in the past (I'm talking about the comments here), and you have a pop-up window blocker running on your computer, then:  Try changing the settings on the pop-up blocker to allow you to click open new windows  Or, an easier way is to hold down the CTRL button while you click the link that opens the new window.  I think most popup blockers will think you really mean it if you go through all that effort, and it will open up the window for you.  Give it a whirl.
