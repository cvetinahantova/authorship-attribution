I really like living in Texas.  It has become home to me over the years of moving all over the country.  However, I have one huge complaint.  It's Fucking HOT.  Thank goodness it is the middle of August, which means that summer will be over in about.......four more months.  The hottest time of the year is usually August to September.  Have you seen the commercial where the guy starts melting into the concrete getting to a soda machine (can't rememer which soda).  It's kinda like that, only without the refreshment of some soda to cool one off.  The only thing offered here is a river that is way to effing cold to play in.  It's really irritating.  It's to hot to go outside, but the one place to go outside and play is to cold.  Screwed up if you ask me.  I think I'll just stay inside of my climate controlled home and pretend that it isn't hot when I go outside to do my laundry (where my laundry room is...ugh).  Can I get an AMEN from my fellow Texans and other southerners?
