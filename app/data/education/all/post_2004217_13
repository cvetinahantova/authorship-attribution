Free afternoon! Wheeee! Went home and tidied my room. Boring I know, but it had to be done. And it was fun to boogie around my bedroom to Fall Out Boy turned up loud without being told to a) Go to school  or b) Go to bed. I am also eternally grateful to the Free Afternoon for allowing me to escape from the common room today. Much gratuitous squealing and repeated playing of George Michael's "Careless Whisper" made me want to stick the stereo up the rest of the year's superficial collective bottom. Ha.  Tonight I am out on the town! Well, I'm going to the Hard Rock Cafe with Daddy Dearest. I'm not sure if he's ever been to a HRC before, because I think if he had he wouldn't be taking me there tonight- £8 for a cheese & bacon burger... Mwahahaha "£ £ £". Tomorrow evening however, (I hope) will prove much more fruitful- I'm staying over at Oliver(cousin)'s Uni halls because we're off to the Union, yay! Fingers crossed he's chosen his friends on the basis of whether they're my type. Me? Self centred? Never! I'M just horny...(ME ME ME ME ME)  Ceff x   He's well hung and I'm hanging on...
