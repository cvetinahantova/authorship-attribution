Ryan Seacrest. Now this cat annoys me. And the other day he received his just desserts. This no talent ass clown was able to get a gig three years ago as the co-host of the popular show  American Idol.  His co-host gets canned and suddenly it becomes his show. Now let me just say, I have watched the show several times because for some reason the people I live with enjoy watching the show. He contributes nothing positive to the show, the few times I've watched he seemed to be a bit of a suck up. But non the less he comes back stronger. He then has TV commercials for the  American Idol  sponsors.  Seacrest then jumps into radio land. And just hold up a second, before we get into the radio stuff. What the hell kind of a name is Seacrest. It has to be made up. If you can give me the national origin of the last name Seacrest I'll give you a dollar. Back to radio. So right when the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) starts "cracking down" on indecent broadcasters (Which really they are going after Howard Stern) Seacrest gets a radio show, the F and the S word, words not allowed to be stated on the radio, get out. The claim ignorance and for some reason they don't get fined, even though Howard Stern is getting fined for word that are made up. What do you think is worse, blumpkin or fuck and shit?  For some reason a show with great prestige for some reason goes to Ryan Seacrest.  America's Top 40  the countdown show, once put on by a Legend Casey Kasem, is now in the hands of a young moron named Ryan Seacrest. Then, for some reason in the fall, Ryan Seacrest is able to get his own television show, which brings us back to the top. He is getting his just desserts and right after making a stupid comment. Seacrest told the reporters that he is "the new King of All Media", we all know that title belongs to Howard Stern. And I was happy to hear the other day that his TV show  On Air  was canceled. His world is beginning to come crashing down, one day at a time.
