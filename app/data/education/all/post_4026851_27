Because I'm sedentary and have no life, I've been spending my Friday reading comic book reviews online and watching shitty afternoon television.  I've seen the same frickin' commercial about 20 times in the past two hours.  No matter what channel I'm browsing, there it is.  Scabby-looking 20-something that's supposedly a (former) high-school student walks into an Asian-run(?) leather store, shopping for a new wallet.  Counter-lady asks him if it's for a graduation, and he stutters "no, I dropped out."  She calls her associate over for help and the two proceed to babble in a foreign tongue, stopping occasionally to look at the guy and giggle.  Then the salesguy brings out a tiny little wallet for the dropout, who replies, "gee, it's kinda small!"  Screen blackout occurs, and this startling fact appears onscreen:  "High school dropouts earn 42% less than graduates."  Sad, but untrue.  I am a high school salutatorian and college graduate.  Now I teach high school, and sadly, that wallet's a bit too large for me.  Midway through the last school year, one of my students dropped out.  I ran into him at a convenience store a few weeks later, and he asked me if I thought what he did was stupid.  I gave him my views on the subject, which pretty much mirrored the message of the aforementioned commercial.  His response was to pull out his wallet. A very large wallet, which was bloated and heavy with cash. "I do alright," he laughed. 'Course, he'll be in the slam before long for possession, distribution, or worse... but I guarantee that he's making a hell of a lot more than me.  The only truly-accurate portrayal in that ad?  Badmouthing the customers in an indecipherable language!  We all know that you're saying bad things about us while we wait on out General Tso's!
