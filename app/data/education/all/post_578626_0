Friday afternoon, and work has slowed to a crawl and so has the clock. I"m looking forward to the weekend and a trip to Shelburne Falls with Ben and Liz.   This week has been calm, but Grace is spinning in my head. Grace Kelly Greenberg is the main character of a novel I've been writing for the past 10 years. OK, only 2 of those I've been actively working on it. But I'll perhaps post some excerpts here. I don't expect anybody to see them. But perhaps it could help me get them done.
