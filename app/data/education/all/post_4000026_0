Well managed to   wake up at 6am... went to Mac at white sands for breakfast by myself. Lol not that I'm a loner or what, I just felt like it. it felt so good to walk in the midst of daylight as fresh air starts to fill around me. Even as I walked I walked with a little beat to it, like as if there was music being played in my mind. It felt real good. Then I got home after a good breakfast and went straight back to bed. yet again I woke up at 2pm, had wesern for lunch, went to see Marlina to get the campaign results and then had a last mintue decision to head to Alvin's house. He bought his new MP3 which is so CooL! "envious mode". Lol lucky chap, well he had some problems to it and I helped him out. And in the end he thanked me by lending me his headset. yeah! Lol. Well it was something I always liked. Then I headed to white sands for dinner and did some schoolwork and now I'm back home, sweet boring quiet little messy room. Hmm... I feel so peaceful now, its like there's complete silence that seems to be the loudest around. And yet again I am dazzled by something... man..whats got into me lately? Oh bummer... I just noticed, pup's on my bed sleeping already, lol cute little chap, wonder how he got up there. Well he shall have the bed then, I'm heading to the floor, peace out ya'll. Hope ya guys would be filling ya minds and dreams with hte sweetness of life... Hmm...like me peaceful soundly quiet little buddy DeeJay..
