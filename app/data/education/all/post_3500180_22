It's been a loong time since I last blogged. So lazy.. yeah.   Not much happened over the last few days. Had a parade on July 3rd in Northville, MI. Good parade, but it was unbearably hot. Yeah. Pshhh.  Well, today I went to school and got my not-so-good report card. Badness. Three of my marks sucks. Well, one of them is okay because it's Phys. Ed., so that doesn't matter. So I guess only two of my marks suck? I did bad.. yeah... Next year, I'll actually try harder, if me and Hikari doesn't mess up again -_-. Yeah... So that might pull my grades up a little bit.  I'm going to China on July 10th, YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Will go back to see my grandparents and all that. Coming back on September 1st. which means I will be here for registering day, and my birthday too. Started packing yesterday. Boring...   Link of the Day : urlLink P u r e n e s s - Hikari's Blog .
