A duo. He British. She Icelandic. Both sing and  urlLink aren't they cute?  To me this group is, to quote the articulate Neil Sedaka (then speaking of Clay Aiken), "ear delicious."  Honeymoon describe it this way:   "The songs are gentle because they're like a one on one dialogue. You wouldn't scream into someone's ear if you're sitting close to them..."It's like sexy, Sunday music."    " urlLink Passive Aggressive " is the kind of gorgeous modern music I picture Sofia Coppola listening to while sipping a Tazo Peach tea in her backyard. "I urlLink  Don't Know What To Say " is a little airier and reminds me of something from the 70's, but I cannot pinpoint.   What's really amusing is that the 3AM Girls - gossip queens in London -  urlLink chatted them up  in their column last week. The record, which will most likely make my Top Ten of 2004, is called  urlLink Dialog  and came out out on July 12 in the UK only. Pffft.
