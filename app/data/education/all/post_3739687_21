hello everyone,  school is going great.  i'm subbing today, but the teacher left work for the girls to do.  math.  ugh. anyway... i'm sending this message out a little early today because i have plans tonight.  today the girls put on a play by sunthronpu (spelling ?) anyway... it was in all thai so i haven no idea what exactly was happening.  however some of the outfits the girls were wearing were western looking so i'm assuming the play isn't very old.  i really need to learn more about thai history.  i have a book, but i've been procrastinating.  anyway...  here are a few things about thai culture i've learned recently.  some of this might be a repeat.  the girls believe that the darker a person's skin is then the more ugly they are.  exactly like the high yellow aspect of african american culture. also, in most of the ads and commercials they use asian people with western looking features instead of traditional thai looking people.  i think it's sad.  it's also weird because most of the westerners over here are more  interested in asian looking people.  you see many male farangs (foreigners) with thai women or men.  there is a large gay community in bangkok.  imagine that.  ha. ha.  well gotta go.  love ya'll.  jane
