And it wasn't that 'Babe'  I assume you mean bad. Geography was good I guess. I hesitated for a second when I had to write a definition of eutrophication. Fortunately my brain kicked in and remembered it from year 9. There was an extended answer on how humans make an impact on the water cycle, which I forgot to do diagrams for. D'oh! After that was G&T, which I found very easy. I know I got one question wrong though. I didn't notice that the race had already been going for like 10 minutes, so my time for when the yachts passed closest was off by like 10 minutes. It was only worth one mark, but the whole thing was only like out 15, so percentage wise it's a bit annoying.   Finally, Intro Calc. Damn that thing was harder than I expected. I finished it though, and after school Mrs Boyland came up to us with the things all marked. I got 100% (yay!). Cartledge got the very first question wrong and lost a mark. I feel good after him mocking me for getting half a mark wrong on the Chem assignment. Ha! Jordan got 17 I think, Hawkins got 16. When Jordan got his score Hawkins looked at him evilly and said "I hate you..." It was funny. I'm amazed at the speed of Mrs Boyland's marking though. Mr Durdan walked past with a shocked look on his face. I wonder when he'll finish marking the other classes EPW's.
