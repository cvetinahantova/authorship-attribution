My posting for the past two days has fallen into a black hole I like to call group work.  I'm finishing a graduate degree at the moment, and there's nothing my professors like better than group work.  I get it in almost every class.  Here's why group work is stupid.  1.  You don't know your pool of potential partners.  In a larger university, you maybe know one or two people from one class to the next.  So it's an educational crap shoot as to who you end up with.  Here's hoping they don't suck!  2.  You can't reassign them or get them fired.  Supposedly group work prepares you for the real world where you have to work with people.  Well in the real world if somebody sucks, you can get them a) off the project, b) assigned to a different project, or c) fired.  If only I could do that now.  3.  Group work, individual grade.  Hey- it's not only yours but also my GPA you're screwing over by not doing good work.  So we all know what that means- I get to spend two days decrapping a project so I don't get a bad grade.  Yippee!  4.  Working with other people.  Why don't people realize their weaknesses?  I know I don't do certain things well.  I'm verbose, and need to limit myself when I write.  So I don't volunteer to write summaries.  Why can't others do the same thing with speaking in public, presenting in class, and proofreading?  So that's it for today.  I'm going to sleep for a week.
