The town's fireworks were really good.  Except for the fact that we parked too close to the trees and the tops got in the way a bit.  Got home just in tiem to watch the race.  Maybe I should have stayed away.  When we walk in the door, Dale JR. is in second and goes for the lead.  WHoo HOOOOOOO.  I'm thinking her we go, another Daytona win to the list.  Yesssir, He is the KInd of restrictor plates.     When I am wrong, I am wrong.    It wouldn't have been so bad, if Gordon hadn't won.  I just really didn't want the 2-4 to win.  I'm sorry, I just dont' like him.  I like him more now than I used to.  I used to be one of those Gordon haters.  Bad.  But now, I can tolerate him.  He is much easier to tolerate since he is rid of Brooke, and is no longer her little puppet.  A lot more human now.   But, at least he didn't lose any ground in the points race.  If you want to call it a points race.    Oh...I got to taste Ameretto last night.  It is actually pretty good.  Not at all what I expected.  Its funny, but I realized that was the first time I ever drank a shot.  I guess you learn sometihng new every day.
