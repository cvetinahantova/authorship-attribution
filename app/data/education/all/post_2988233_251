Something strange happened tonight.    It came from left field, and took me totally by surprise.    Tommy told me he likes my writing.    I don't really know why this shocked me so much, but it almost left me breathless.  Knocked me for a loop actually.    It wasn't expected, or even wanted.  But I like it.    For a long time, I have been a mom.  Just a mom, completely a mom.  Blogging has opened up parts of me I didn't know existed.  Feelings I didn't know I had, thoughts I would  never have dreamed of having, much less putting them down in black and white for others to read.    When a person, especially a woman, has children, they lose their identity.  Whether by choice, or circumstance, you are no longer "Angi, college grad who loves to sing, read and go 4 wheelin', and once aspired to be a lawyer", you are "Tj's mom", "the mom with all the boys ".  I don't know how many times I have been introduced as that.  That is fine.   It is a role, I take on with humility, because I am blessed enough to be someone's mom.  I am a mother.  It is what I was born to do.  Honestly, it is.  I am one of those natural, instinctive mothers.  I can hear another woman's child cry, and tell you what is wrong with it.  It is in my genes, to be a mother.    But sometimes, it is nice to be recognized as something else.  Something not at all related to being a mom.  Like my husband telling me he enjoys my writing.    Thanks honey.  I needed that.
