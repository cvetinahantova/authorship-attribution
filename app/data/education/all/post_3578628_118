I got back today from my 24 hour bike ride that I took with my dad (he pooped out so I finished it by myself the other 13 hours, lol) in Indy.  I came directly here to see what had developed and I must say that I am sooo relieved to see that everyone is doing ok still.  After my bad experience with this thing after my vacation to TN, this was very nice.  I'm glad to see that problems are getting resolved peacefully and to see growth both in our friendships and innerselfs too.   Also...I've got a bad update for y'all.  Spt. Mills had decided (lol) that school shall open on time after all.  There are currently about 9 classrooms in the Auditorium (I think 3 on the balcony, 5 on the floor (where the seats used to be), and maybe, MAYBE, one on the stage).  I hope I didn't burst anyone's bubble!  Also...I'd like to be the first to say that if anyone is mad at me for any reason of which I know that you would know if you were mad at me and for what, I did not make the decision on any biases or any other deciding factor.  I simply went with the choice that I felt would work best for what was needed to be done.  Maybe something new will come up this year requiring another decision to be made, but don't get any hopes up!
