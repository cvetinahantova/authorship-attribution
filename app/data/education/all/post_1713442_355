urlLink Career Passports, Portfolios, and Certificates. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Michael Wonacott.  It looks at several career education concepts for teaching.  From the ERIC Digest:  One of the pressing needs of employers today is for workers with new and different sets of knowledge and skills, including positive attitudes, good work habits, the ability to learn a diverse set of tasks, and problem-solving, communication, scientific, and interpersonal skills (Connecticut Department of Labor 2001). Educators, especially those in career and technical education (CTE), are addressing those new and different sets of knowledge and skills alongside other, more traditional knowledge and skills. In addition, however, educators must communicate those new and different sets of knowledge and skills to employers.    Unfortunately, the traditional high school diploma and transcript do not communicate that information well to employers (BRIDGING THE GAP 1993). Neither provides the information employers want on thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and group skills; transcript information may be inconsistent or difficult to interpret; a diploma often reflects minimum standards; and schools sometimes do not respond to requests for transcripts in a timely manner. This Digest reviews other ways secondary educators are using to communicate students' new and different sets of knowledge and skills to employers--passports, portfolios, and certificates.    A career passport may be characterized as "a formal product or document in which students present the many marketable skills they have developed through their life experiences (Charner and Bhaerman 1986, p. 1). A career portfolio is a similar product with a different focus; it is a working tool that organizes information and documents for career planning and self-assessment (Pond et al. 1998). A career certificate is a document issued by an educational agency formally attesting that a student possesses specific skills.
