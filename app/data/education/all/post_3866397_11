I missed a post or two last week, but this week I should be on top of things.  Work's getting a little frenzied as we approach the start of a new school year.  This is also my last week before my final year of grad school begins again.  Should be interesting.  Here are the reviews, ratings out of 5 stars as usual.  Miracle:  What's not to love about a true story of this magnitude?  The thing that really set this apart from other underdog sports movies is the attention to detail.  Every play was right on, and you felt like you were watching those games again.  Also, the movie recreated the political and cultural atmosphere of the time perfectly.  With such rich context and great performances all around, this is a can't-miss movie.  Four and a half stars.  Starship Troopers 2:  I know, I know.  Call it morbid curiosity.  This was exactly what I'd expect out of a direct-to-video sequel to a cheesy sci-fi flick.  None of the original actors, a departure from the original plot (although a minor one compared to most of these films), more gore, and more nudity.  Ah yes- if you don't have the star power and the budget, put in some nudity.  With that said, I did find it interesting enough to watch all the way to the ridiculous ending.  One and a half stars.  The New Guy:  A friend recommended it, so I gave it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn't just another crude sophomoric humor movie with the same tired jokes.  This movie took the formula and dialed down the crude humor quite a bit (except for the opening scene, it was pretty tame compared to most other movies of this type) while finding different ways to get laughs.  Maybe I was just too tired when I watched it, but I thought it was hilarious.  Eddie Griffin is excellent, and the cameos alone make it worth watching.  Few things are better than a psychopathic Vanilla Ice beating record store customers down.  While not for everybody, it was a solid comedy in my opinion.  Four stars.
