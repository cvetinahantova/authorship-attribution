I am struggling today to stay focussed. I don't know whether it's because of lack of sleep or if it's due to boredom through not being motivated to do any work. I've done nothing but eat again and spent most of the day chatting on the net. I've had 2 blatant offers of sex, one for Saturday and one for Monday - all arranged with date, time, place.   I've just gone off at a friend for no reason. I was being crude, thinking at the time it was funny, then as I read it, I realised I was abusing the trust and friendship that had been built up. To her credit, she is being an absolute rock, if it were me I would have thrown it back 10 fold.  I am hoping I can get motivated sufficiently for football later. I want to work so damned hard that I collapse, just to try and get this shit out of my system. I just hope my body will allow me to do it. Perhaps I should look at the gym sooner, rather than later, or perhaps I need to find something else, or just get some sleep.
