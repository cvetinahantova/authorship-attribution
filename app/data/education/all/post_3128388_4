I can't believe myself! I nearly forgot to blog at all today! Curse myself *shoots*. Actually, that's conter-productive because then I wouldn't be able to blog at all. Some strange person has contacted me through my site, I'm becoming more and more scared of numerous people finding it. Why would they? :S. It's scary. There's nothing on there at all. But for some reason, I was persuaded by him... well... reminded to update it in someway, so I've finally got a nice background image for it. I could have used one of the World Wide Wong ones, but I made a new one that also says "Nathan's site" on it.   I've cut writing this far too short. I might have to add something later or something similar, write it on the other computer. Actually, I'll come on later.  Chow for now!
