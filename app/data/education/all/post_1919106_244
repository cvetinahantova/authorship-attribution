What is tall, shiny, and buzzes when wet? Power lines!   Today was the last class day for Algorithms. the last assignment is due tomorrow, and the final is next week. So that's keeping me pretty busy it is. I know better than to cram all week however. I do not perform well under stress, so the best thing for me to do right now is to study bit-by-bit, and to take any possible chance to relax. Of the latter, there are plenty now. I've been getting up pretty early, but I've also been going to bed early as well. And I don't know if it's because of that or because I've been getting my life straight and on tracks, but I've been way more energetic these days than I have been for a long time. Of course, it could also be the beer. Damn good stuff it is, and relaxing on the Grad House patio and enjoying what I got at hand is not something that I can complain about.
