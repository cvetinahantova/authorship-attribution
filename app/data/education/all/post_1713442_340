urlLink Modeling Information Seeking and Using Process in the Workplace  This article is by Bonnie Wai-yi Cheuk of Nanyang Technological University (Singapore).  It was published in  Information Research , Volume 4 No. 2 October 1998.  From the site:  This paper reported a qualitative study into the information seeking and use process of eight auditors and eight engineers in their workplace contexts. (This doctorate research project has also studied eight architects, however, the analysis and findings have not been completed and are not reported here). The aim of this research project is to empirically develop a model, referred to as information seeking and use process model (or ISU process model), that can meaningfully reflect real-life practice. This model would have implications for information professionals involved in the management of information services, systems design and information literacy education.
