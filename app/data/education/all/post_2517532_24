About two weeks ago,  Phoebe Buffay  (my baby/cat) gave birth to four cute kittens.  My sister and I were really excited about it and we already decided which kitten would belong to each of us (one for me, one for my sister, one for our brother and, lastly, one for the helper).   Phoebs  brought her "babies" from the secret place where she gave birth in to my locker.  There were nights we couldn't sleep because the little ones sang us " meow-meow " songs (someimes to our dismay!).  We couldn't wait for them to grow big so we could play with them.  But, all of a sudden,  Phoebs  got sick.  Maybe, she ate something.  For three whole days, she couldn't eat.  She couldn't even walk two steps.  She was just so weak.  I fed her through a dropper.  Everyone (except me) thought she would die.  Every single night, I'd stay with her, praying and crying at the same time.  It was total torture for me.  I was so scared and worried.  After those dreadful days, she miraculously gained a little strength and was able to eat a little.  But, she still couldn't feed her "babies".  She was sick for a week, and so, one by one, the dear little ones died.  It was really sad, especially knowing and thinking that we couldn't do anything about it.  There are no vets here.  I played doctor to  Phoebs , but the poor kittens, I (we) couldn't save them. :-(  Now, Phoebs is okay.  She's a little weak still, but she has gone back to her old self again, sometimes even playing with  Dugong  (my sis' cat), who is also on the family way. :-)    And, another thing is that I have a new baby (kitten).  He was given to me by my brother's girlfriend.  He's a super sweet and lovable little guy.  He's been with me all but two days and we are just so much in love.  He sleeps on my hair...  Hehehe:-)  After losing four "grandkittens", God has given me (us) one to fill the space/place left by our "angel kittens"... :-)
