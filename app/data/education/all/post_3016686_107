urlLink    World superstars   urlLink The Scissor Sisters   finally make it back our fair shores and THIS is what lead singer Jake Shears (aka Jason Sellards) wears to the show? Guess it is a way to get noticed - another psuedonymous (is that a word>) star, Bono Vox, was in the small crowd with beefy guards nearby.  PS: Their single "Take Your Mama" is the best Elton John song since 1979.   photo courtesy of   urlLink  this dude    via   urlLink  Arjan
