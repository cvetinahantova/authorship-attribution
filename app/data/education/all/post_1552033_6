Over the past 48 hours or so I have discovered that I have the most boring blog in cyberspace.  I wonder if I should change the title?  The only way to improve things would be to learn enough DHTML to deeply and thoroughly rewrite the template that controls how this page is layed out.  Sadly, I am too old, too stubborn, and too stupid to simply buy a $50 book, read it, and become a DHTML master.  I know this for a fact because over the past few years I have bought a dozen such books and I still can't remember which tags are "open" and which are "closed", let alone remember more than a handful of the tags themselves.  My own website,  urlLink Greyhawk Manor , represents the "height" of my HTML mastery and it's so simple a modern elementary school student could do the same in a single afternoon.  It took me a year of study and six months of coding.  Old age sucks.  Don't misunderstand me!  I have no desire to stay young.  None.  Zero. Zip. Zilch.  Not even a hint.  I look forward to growing old, getting gray hair, developing wrinkles, and of course, becoming hopelessly stubborn and obstinate.  My hope is that "crotchety" will be the kindest thing people say about me.  I  love  growing old!  But it still sucks.
