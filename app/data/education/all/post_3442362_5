I fell in love with the Doctor on the ship.  I think I've seen this Paul Bettany character around before (and it appears he's 'linked', 'crushin on' or some more other less polite term to Jennifer Connelly.  Good thing I'm married.  She would have to be sought out and destroyed).  In this film however, he is absoulutely adorable.  To die for.  When that jerk-off sea captain Russell Crowe who thinks he's all that sails away from the Galapogos Island I just about cry.  How dare he??  So that he can chase after some ghost ship?  He broke the promise he made to his very best friend.  I was so incredibly pissed I couldn't believe it.  Do I perhaps have issues I need to deal with??? hmmmmm Anyway, there is just way the hell to much killing.   And I can't believe those little boys really had to work on those ships.   It's an okay movie.  I probably won't watch it again.  But we own it, so feel free.
