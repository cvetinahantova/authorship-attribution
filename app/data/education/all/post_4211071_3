Oh okay... God, am I getting married? heheh :)... I don't know why I asked that and please forget about it... Nonetheless, it doesn't worth any answer... I'm 18!!! Argh... I don't even have a boyfriend, how can I get married???      Why do I asked that? Well... I was browsing few collections on the net and saw  Vera Wang's collections  (bridal, i mean)... It was so nice, glamorous... fantastic and I was dreaming that, am I getting married wearing those??? They were all so nice and I was dreaming wearing them. But I'm sure that I won't unless, I'm married with English lads... wakakaka~      Ok.. I ends here before I starts blurbing about wedding gowns... bye~
