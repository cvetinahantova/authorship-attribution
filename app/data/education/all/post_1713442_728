One of nine children of a Presbyterian minister, Cleveland was born in Caldwell, New Jersey in 1837 . He was raised in upstate New York . As a lawyer in Buffalo , he became notable for his single-minded concentration upon whatever task faced him.   At 44, he emerged into a political prominence that carried him to the White House in three years. Running as a reformer, he was elected Mayor of Buffalo in 1881 , and later, Governor of New York .   Cleveland won the Presidency with the combined support of Democrats and reform Republicans , the "Mugwumps," who disliked the record of his opponent James Blaine of Maine .   A bachelor , Cleveland was ill at ease at first with all the comforts of the White House. "I must go to dinner," he wrote a friend, "but I wish it was to eat a pickled herring, a Swiss cheese and a chop at Louis' instead of the French stuff I shall find." In June 1886 Cleveland married 21-year-old Frances Folsom ; he was the first President to be married while in office, and only President to be married in the White House .   Cleveland vigorously pursued a policy barring special favors to any economic group. Vetoing a bill to appropriate $10,000 to distribute seed grain among drought-stricken farmers in Texas , he wrote: "Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character. . . .
