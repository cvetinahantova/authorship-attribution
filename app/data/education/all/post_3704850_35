We have  finally  gotten our  WYSIWYG  editor. It works moderately well, creates acceptably clean  XHTML , and once we give it a few more tweaks, could make our future re-designs much more simple. I have just discovered how to implement a stylesheet within the editor window, and have made a pared-down version of ours specifically for the  WYSIWYG , so those who must use it will now get a (fairly) accurate example of what they will get as an end product. Serendipitously, this "light" stylesheet could be used on the site as a whole as an alternate to send to television and handheld mediaâ€”little more than a selling point now, but who knows how these will be used in the coming years.   So far, so good. The end is nigh.
