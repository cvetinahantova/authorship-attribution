Lets see here...what is the executive forum...another way for our class to throw money that we don't have out the window. It is also training for our incoming officers. Lets see, who are our incoming officers; Gayle, already and officer; Emma, not previously and officer; and Kara, already an officer. What is the point of the executive forum again, oh yes, to TRAIN NEW OFFICERS, Gayle and Kara are not new! What do they need training for. I don't think we need to waste money to train Gayle and Kara, even though they still need it. They know what they have to do already, why must we blow any profit we have on sending OLD officers to a NEW officers conference.
