Sorry for the recent absence, I was in Chicago, getting an apartment and a job.  The apartment is west of  urlLink Bucktown  and south of  urlLink Logan Square  or, for those of you familiar with Chicago, right around the California blue line stop.  The job is at  urlLink East-West University , a small private school in the south loop primarily serving graduates of the Chicago public school system.  I will make very little money teaching these kids how to read a novel, write a paper, and  generally ruminate on Man's place in the universe.
