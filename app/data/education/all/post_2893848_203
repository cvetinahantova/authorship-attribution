Coprolalia by scott  Today on the el I encountered some poor man with coprolalia, an uncontrollable urge to cuss. This is symptomatic of Tourette's, a disease of disinhibition. I didn't get the chance to ask the man if he had Tourrette's because he was busy heckling the train car with his obscenities. Which, of course, he couldn't control. The sad part, rather, the part that made it for me, was that all his swearing was fucking hilarious, and almost appropriate. For example, some girl's cell phone rang, and in between his Yosemite Sam-like shouting of "fucking fuck shit fucking hellshit" he paused to direct his face at her, and yelled "fucking cell phone bitch fucking fuck can't you fucking turn that hellshit off i fucking fuck fuck fuck fuck ask fucking you." Then some huge guy came on the train at north & clybourn and mr. coprolalia went right into him. "fucking burger tits! hellshit burger burger shits tits! fuck those burger tits!" this huge guy looked around, to see if this was for real, and saw people trying to ignore the cusser, like he was someone begging for money. of course, i was giggling uncontrollably to myself. Once mr. coprolalia saw me laughing, he gave me the "fucking funny FUCK FUCK hellshit! arrgh! take my fucking asscap!" treatment.
