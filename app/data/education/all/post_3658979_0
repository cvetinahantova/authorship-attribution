Ever have that feeling you had when you were a kid?  You know--the feeling of freedom.  No bills to pay.  No job to get up for in the morning.  The biggest worry you had was if Mom was going to make that awful meatloaf again.  I had that today.  I bought a bike.  It sounds corny, I know.  My husband and I filled out this little survey that listed things we enjoyed to do.  Bike riding was one we both ranked high.  So we bought bikes.  I haven't ridden a bike in over 10 years, at least.  It's an amazing feeling.  I recommend a bike to everyone out there over 25.  It'll make you feel 10 again.  The wind was whipping through my hair.  I was pumping my legs as fast as I could.  I even did the whole "standing up to get more leverage" thing.  I was carefree.  I was free.
