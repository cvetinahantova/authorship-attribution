On a normal day, you can drive all over the fair city of Richmond in about fifteen minutes. However, if you are too impaired to drive or plan on getting too impaired to drive and need a cab don't expect them to make such a speedy trip. The cab companies are located pretty much smack dab in the middle of town as are the bars. The major apartment complexes are located at either interstate exit about ten minutes from downtown. This would lead you to think that getting a cab is a fast process. It's not.  The promised twenty minute wait for our cab downtown took almost thirty five. "I'll be here at midnight", our cabbie Jeff told us. "We line up all the way down the street when the bars close." Good deal we thought until we exited the bar. Lots of cops waiting to arrest poor drunken souls. No cabs to haul our sorry asses home. We waited for a few minutes and I gave up and called the cab company. "Well we had some cabs down there," the dispatcher said. "But no one wanted to ride in one." Meanwhile, the cops are yelling that the bar has been closed for twenty minutes now and it's time to go...somewhere. They herd us to the corner of the street to make it easier to hail the cab that is nowhere to be seen.  We eventually give up and take a ride from one of our group's cousins who has a Bible and two packs of mini donuts on his dashboard.  There isn't really a moral to this story. It's just the only part of last night I want to talk about right now.   Tony News:   Tony will start 24th in tomorrow's Brickyard 400. At last practice, he was running 13th. Good luck #20!
