This stinks, I had an update on Tommy ready to hit publish, and then I leaned over the keyboard, hit some buttons, and everything went blank!!!!!  Things are better.  He told me he is tired of living life the way it is now, finances are a mess, very stressful.  SO that helped me alot.  I told him how guilty I feel over putting him thrugh this with all my screw ups in the check book, and bouncing all those checks.  I cried.  He hates it when I cry.  But we talked for a few mintues, so that helped.  Will, my 10 yr old, walked into my parents house today, " IQUIT!!!! It is too hot, and I am too tired, I quit my job!"  His job? walking their dog once a day.  I think he will be the child that never leaves home.
