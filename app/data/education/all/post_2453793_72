well, for my birthday i have decided that 5 months of secret (for the most part) journaling has been enough to let me venture out into the world of true blogging...where i can be searched for...where people can read my entries and whatnot...so i've started a livejournal account.  drew encouraged me, without knowing at all.  i've thought about it for a while...but i purposely started a blog here so that people couldn't search for me or happen to stumble upon me.  i'm moving on, and hopefully this will be the start of the journal i've wanted from the start...we'll see... :)
