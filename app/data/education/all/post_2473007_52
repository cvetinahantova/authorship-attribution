The entire universe is swallowed up in frozen cream     Scooped from heaven and heaped upon treetops. Children bury naked hands deep and let the beauty     Burn its icy heat beneath the unending whiteness. Diamonds plunge earthward onto eager tongues,     Dissolving instantly into innocent laughter As pure as the untouched flake from the silver sky,     Hanging, suspended between heaven above and heaven below While angels rest on front lawns And the world is again good.
