i can't belive what i got myself into this time........  well, needless to say, i got caught..again. what's new? turns out, mommy's bitching about my picture with jammi lead to tito cocoy's berserk mode. he went mad exactly like the last time. this time it was worst, my bro was there. whatever. so i don't have anyone to team up with at home. it happened before and i didn't die. i could do this. bad thing is, my bro isn't talking to me. i don't know why but i'm really worried.  goddammit! i told daryl about my "i love you" incident with jammi. what the hell, she's my best friend anyway..i think....  i can't believe that kuya mico and paula are a couple. this is some news!  well, the other day, i said good-bye to jammi. i even shared my "one year quarantine" plan with him. and i told him i do love him, unfortunately, over the net. later that night, he called me. and i told him that things weren't so bad after all. he didn't have to wait for a year [yes!] and i whispered the most awaited and stupidest thing i couldever blurt out, "i love you, baby". but, hey, it was worth it.   we still haven't talked and i miss him.  i'm still waiting for my folks to call. i'm wondering how they'd react to this.
