Last night I pulled the closest thing to an all-niter than I had in years. That paper I'd been stressing over was given an extension, but of course, I didn't do it. I finally finished last night at nearly 4 am. Then, I woke up at 7 and went to school. It's now about 7 pm, and I'm in the school's library. Ugh. I need sleep...  Summer school was better today. They reduced our class size, so I don't think we had more than 20 kids in any of my classes. However, my co-op teacher still isn't happy, since she's being forced to teach science and social studies for her 3rd period.   I had been getting kind of anxious about not having actually gotten the chance to practice my teaching skills, but now I have a different anxiety: my first "real" lesson will be in social studies. I am really lucky in that another Fellow in my school is in the same situation, and we're going to try to work together. It's kind of crazy...me, teaching social studies! (She wanted to give me science, but I said no thanks!)  Besides that, things are okay, I guess. The kittens are good, and they make me happy. Which reminds me, that I need to make them happy and go get them some kitty kibble. Gotta run!
