Good News   It seems that things within the pack are working out. There are considerably less conflicts than there were last time. That makes me a happy, happy panda! Now I only need to work on getting enough sleep to not fall over.  I also bought some nice posters today. The overall selection wasn't all that good compared to previous semesters, but there were some nice things in there.
