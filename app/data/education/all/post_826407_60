Went to see this on Thursday with H.  Beautiful, beautiful film.  Parts of it are like watching sunshine.  It is a very gentle and tender examination of family, love and trust.    What I found most interesting was the way food was treated.  Several times in the film meals appeared almost as sacrament.  Allowing people access to family life and rebuilding relationships, I liked that.   urlLink Go see
