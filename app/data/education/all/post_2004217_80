After the (generally) upbeat tone of the last post, I find myself 3 days into the Easter holidays with nothing to do and an enthusiasm only to sit at the computer, doing nothing, which isn't really bloggable material. The most interesting thing to happen today was a phone call from Dad: Wicked Stepmother has a new job with HMI (Her Majesty's Inspectors- to put some perspective on the magnitude of this job, Ofsted is their bitch), which according to Dad, will incur "changes". Ones that he refuses to talk about on the phone. Intriguing. It's probably not to do with money, although I won't rule it out; mum says HMI get moved around the country at the drop of a hat, so maybe they're moving away... I don't know how I feel about that. I seem to be getting on with Dad at the moment, so him moving away might make me unhappy. Mind you, if you'd asked my in February I couldn't have cared less where he went, as long as he suffered a horrible car crash on the way there and died a horrible death in a horrible way. Ahem.  I bought the NERD album, by the way. It's good; very slick, very sexy, very "Pharell".  Ho hum.  Ceff x   Love is not a victory march...
