Currently I'm listening to Enya's Orinoco Flow, which is really a fine, soothing piece of music.  Unfortunately it has been forever tainted by an incident where I was kidnapped by the drunk ex-girlfriend of my roommate. Too drunk to drive herself, one of her roommates drove her to our apartment where she, on the edge of an emotional breakdown, asked me come over and visit. She then locked me in her room, lit candles, and played an Enya CD that repeated in an endless loop.  She asked me to lay next to her (fully clothed) while she drifted off to sleep.  No way I could possibly sleep and was horrified at the possibility of her trying to make a move on me (this is not vanity speaking; she had, at a previous incident, acted incredulous when I refused to invite her inside my apartment after having dinner with her).  Luckily, she drifted off in a drunken stupor and I departed post haste.  See, now that's why I'm gay!
