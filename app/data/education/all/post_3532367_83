Last night went well. Managed to get over for 20:00. Spent the night drinking coffee, while Angela downed a bottle of red wine as we both felt too tired to go out. We chatted, things got very deep (conversationally) and we made love into the late hours and cuddled. I got home late, but it was worth the time spent being happy, just to enable me to re-group.
