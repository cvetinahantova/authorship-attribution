i'm all pissed off right now because i was working on making a web site to put all my photos from korea on (i'm doing this mostly because i've been using yahoo photos it is a piece of shit program, half the time it doesn't even load, most people i refer to that site email me back saying it doesn't work). anyway, i'm poor, so i was going to use the free geocities server for my photo site. however, today as i was working on it, i kept viewing the pages to check my changes. after about three views, it suddenly stopped working and said that i was over the limit of my data transfer. so pretty much i can view it twice a day and that's it.  care was telling me today that she'd like to start our own server service (does that make sense?), or at least use our own computer for our server. i wouldn't mind doing that, but it's a lot of work that i don't know much about.  so as of now, my photo site is scrapped, and my e-zine is on the shelf (since i think i'll need to actually pay for a domain name and the like before i start it). i need another project to keep me busy. i still have my original web site with my writing. i've updated it slightly, but nothing drastic. i think i might redo the entire site anyway. i can definitely make it better.
