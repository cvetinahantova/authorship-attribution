I ALWAYS read multiple Lockergnome RSS feeds BECAUSE of the cutting edge technology news and information. I know that some of you that read my BLOG do the same for the same reasons.  Good for you!!  You will be ahead of the game because of the knowledge you are going to glean from this resource.  Below I cut and pasted the paragrapy about SOS Crash Recovery.  I am going to check this out and hopefully you will do the same.      Every Lockergnomie needs SOS Crash Recovery! SOS can fully restore your system without requiring reinstallation of all your original software or the operating system! Just boot up from the SOS command or program, recover the SOS image backup and presto - everything is back exactly as you like it! SOS will not affect the performance of your system. Fully restore a crashed system in 15-30 minutes. SOS goes way beyond the System Restore tool included with Windows XP, which requires an active session of Windows in order to accomplish the System Restore process. SOS can work from Windows or from DOS mode if Windows cannot boot or function properly. SOS can even store the disk image on another drive or DVD for additional safety in the event of a crash or mechanical failure of the primary drive. SOS will also remember your software and put it back the way it was before the crash. If you have valuable data, you can save yourself from a huge amount of work after a crash. This product can truly save the day. With the proliferation of so many viruses, the potential for disk crashes has increased. You really need an inexpensive and quick way to restore your PC, apps, and valuable data. SOS is a great solution!
