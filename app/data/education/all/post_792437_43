New Stuff--it's about time!    Mmmm...I'm writing here to deter my attention, or should I say that I'm slacking off? Hmm, either way, I'm writing! I take my GRE exam in two days. Yikes! It's about time I took the stupid test and got it over with. Been studying for that test since, Oh I can't even remember. Yes let me think, I think it was more like 2 or 3 months ago! I know I know. We'll see the score then know if the studying was worth it. All of you who read this, please please please pray for me and my success on the exam :)
