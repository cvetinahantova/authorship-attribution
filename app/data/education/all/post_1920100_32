Its me!  I have been very blessed by a dear friend of mine that has been encouraging me a lot lately. Thank you Lord for bringing people so loving and kind. We read psalm 103 together about "The Love of God" It is a great psalm. We are both meditating on this psalm and keeping ourselves accountable to this. I am meditating on the first two verses: Prasie the Lord, my soul! All my being, praise his holy name! Praise the Lord, my sould and do not forget how kind he is" I hope you guys also get encouraged by these verses as I have. Well today I go to my book meeting. I really enjoy that time with the ladies. They share a lot of experience and wisdom and we have a chance to enjoy eachothers company.
