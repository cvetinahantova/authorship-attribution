Well, tomorrow's the big day. Meep. I've gotten my pipeline account fixed, and I'm all registered, but still no word on my financial aid, which is bad because it's supposed to pay for my books, which I don't have yet.  In other news, Stephanie's coming to visit! She's in town because she has to pick up her sister at the airport and deliver her here to start classes tomorrow. So, we're meeting tonight around dinnertime. Yay!  There's no way I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight. :P
