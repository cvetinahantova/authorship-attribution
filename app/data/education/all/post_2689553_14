Well, last night was the prom.  Willow Valley is one of the 10 nicest places I've ever eaten in/danced in.  Of course, its probably #1 on my list of the 10 nicest places I've ever eaten in in Pennsylvania, and since I've only ever actually danced like that twice(the other being post-prom), its #1 on my list of places I've ever danced in.  The food was good, some of the best chicken breast I've ever had.   The dancing, well....I didn't dance to the fast stuff at first, cuz I'm no good at it, and I didn't want to make a fool of myself.  But I did dance with Kristine to the slower stuff.  Post-prom was fun, but got really old around 4-ish.  I put at least  like 10,000 dollars worth of prize vouchers into the bucket for the PS2 and didn't win a thing.  Gotta go now.  At least it was play money. Pictures tomorrow.
