Another volcano blog entry.  Did a heli flight over Pu'u O'o and Kupaianaha vents, the latter being fully obscured by subsequent flows, the former showing activity and recent flows still slowly running downslope.  What a thrill to fly over and check it out up so close.  Hopefully the video footage will turn out.  The conference starts this evening, I think.  No real good description of when and where we're supposed to meet!  If I ever put on a conference, I'll try to be more on top of things than these folks are...I imagine it'd be hard, though, to think of everything.  I miss CJ and TK and hope they're feeing better in Maine; they've been sick the past couple of days.  Das ist alle.
