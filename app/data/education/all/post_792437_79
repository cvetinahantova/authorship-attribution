To be observed..    Â  Ahhh..I suppose it's nerve wrecking but people think it's a good thing too. I was told a while back by my advisor that we would be having program reviewers come into the biology department to review how the department is run. She said that during the time I teach, one of them was going to come observe me :( Not only is this reviewer supposed to observe me, but also my advisor will be with him or her...gee thanks ...as I am not nervous enough with one person around! I guess I don't know what to be nervous about...I mean I know what I'm teaching...I suppose it's just the thought of teaching it in front of people who know more than me....considering my advisor..  I teach in about 2 hours..and this 2 hour wait is certainly not one of the best times I've ever experienced! can't wait to have it over with...
