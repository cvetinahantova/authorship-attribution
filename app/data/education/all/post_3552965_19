I'm sitting in Rose's wee room in Rose's house somewhere on Totterdown Street, South London.  The monotony of unemployed life in 'Great' Yarmouth was all getting a bit much so I decided to spend a few days in the big smoke.  Actually the main reason for the visit is that I have a Job Interview (the job I mentioned on the blog a few updates ago, for those of you who've been tuning in on a regular basis)which I'm both excited and nervous about.  I'm pleased to have been shortlisted but I'd also really, really like to get the job as it seems to be the kind of thing I'm after and decent money (for ESOL teaching anyway).  Don't want to talk about it anymore as I'm anxious that I'll somehow tempt fate and have it all snatched from my hands before I even turn up.  Anyway, if you check into this in time cross your fingers for me tomorrow at 2.15 and let's all hope my effervescent charm and innate brilliance shine through (heh, heh, heh).
