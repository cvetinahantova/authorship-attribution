just finished writing up the longest analysis assignment ever... was all excited to watch scrubs, which i thought i recorded last night.  turns out i only recorded 9:55-10:05 instead of 8:55-10:05, so i got the whole last 5 minutes... the moral of the story without the story... oops.  my leg hurts.  i accidentally bumped my telescope (which sits by my closet door) as i was getting out clothes for today, and as i walked away it fell and jammed really hard into the back of my calf... i'm in progress of creating the hugest bruise ever... OUCH =(
