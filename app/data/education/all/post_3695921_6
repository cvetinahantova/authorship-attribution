This is the end, my only love the end...For everything bla bla the end...  I don´t remember but today most things are coming to an end... I can feel something in the air. But let´s go to facts:  Yesterday there was a guy in my bed: my nephew :(.  I love him and I feel really grateful for his immense love, but let´s face: that could be another kind of guy in there. Should I wait and complain?   Of course not, there are more things to be done: I´m thinking about taking a trip...seriously!! All I know is that it should be somewhere nice and with lots of cute guys.  Today I have to work hard and I should be thinking about something better to do in July.  IDEAS: pop up!!!!!!
