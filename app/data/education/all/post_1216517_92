FUNNY FRENCH LIGHTNING  i saw a lot of lightning tonight. crazy stuff that lightning. it's bright and scary. i'm glad i wasn't electrocuted. could have been a sorry sight. like that guy in 'the great outdoors.'   i was surfing the net and stumbled across this comic genius from the  urlLink anti-french joke page    (120) Date:���04/04/03  Name:���Ms Aurelie Catena  Sex:��� female  Age:��� not given  Joke(s):���Hi!  First to know you must that not my first language is English and thus strange will look my sentences.� Anyway by the words is not stopped the Wise and only the Meaning he does consider.  Moreover, the joke I'm going to send (it will come, be patient) was originally sent to me in German, which is also not my first language, and I had to translate it into English. Hopefully it will have kept all its original sting after the two-step processing. Here it is (for those among you who prefer to read it in the original version, I shall put it at the end):  Three Texan surgeons are playing golf and discuss about the latest advances in surgery. The first surgeon says: "I'm the best surgeon in Texas. A pianist lost 7 fingers during an accident, I took care of him and 8 months later he gave a private concert for the Queen of England".  The second says: "That's crap. A young man lost both arms and one leg during an accident, I took care of him and two years later he won a golden medail at the Olympic games."  Then the third spoke: "Your are but amateurs. A few years ago, a man, drunk from alcohol and cocain, was hit frontally by a train at 80 mph. All that was left from the accident was the arse of his horse and his cow-boy's hat. By now he is president of the France !"  Funny, isn'it?  Aurelie  And now, for those who prefer it, the German version:  Drei Texanische Chirurgen spielen Golf und unterhalten sich �ber die Fortschritte in der Chirurgie. Einer sagt, "ich bin der beste Chirurg in Texas. Ein Konzertpianist verlor 7 Finger bei einem Unfall, Ich habe sie wieder angen�ht und 8 Monate sp�ter hat er ein privat Konzert bei der K�nigin von England gegeben."  Ein anderer sagt. "Das ist nichts. Ein junger Mann verlor beide Arme und beide Beine bei einem Unfall, Ich habe sie wieder angen�ht und 2 Jahre sp�ter hat er eine Goldmedaille an den olympischen Spielen gewonnen."�  Der dritte Chirurg meint, "Ihr seid Amateure. Vor einigen Jahren ritt ein Mann high von Kokain und Alkohol frontal in einen Zug der mit 80 Meilen daher kam. Alles was noch �brig war, war das Arsch des Pferdes und der Hut des Cowboys. Heute ist er Pr�sident der Vereinigten Staaten."
