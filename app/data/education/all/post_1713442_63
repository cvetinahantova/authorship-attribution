urlLink Traverse City Convention & Visitors Bureau   Well, my trip to the Grand Traverse Bay area was a success.  Julie, Stephanie, and my boys had a good time exploring the town and area.  I had a successful presentation and I found many of the presentations informative.  I had a full house for my lecture on plagiarism.  The room was a laptop lab with wireless internet connections.  There were only 25 seats so my session was full a few minutes before I started.  My lecture went well and I felt I made some good points.  I got excellent questions from the audience.  They liked my "identify the plagiarized papers" assignment and all the groups nailed the stolen papers quickly.  I got high evaluation marks with a few exceptions.  (One attendee clearly did not read the program description as he was expecting content I had no intention of covering.)      I hope to attend this conference next year.  It will also be in Traverse City in September 2004.
