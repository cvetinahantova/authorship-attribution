Day 1 - Get to class 10 min. early. Getting alittle nervous. As I sit 2 come in who were in my other classes at D-town. This proves it is a small world. Now when I say I am nervous I don't mean sick nervous, more like apprehensive. The Prof is cool. Very funny funny and very intellengent. I feel more at ease.  we wheel out teh 2 cadavors. Both are male. 1 died age 70 from lukemia on 12/12/03. The other died in Feb. of this year at the age of 85 form heart failure. I see myself in this one, skinny, bald, and a big nose. Is this foreshaddowing?  We opened the white body bags which have their cadavor #, sex, date of death and cause of death written in black sharpie. Next the sound of the zipper the bag is being opened leave me alittle unnerved at first.  They are in the supine position. Their faces were covered with a shroud. At first I am at teh 70yr old had to pull his feet free of the bag and check the number on the toe tag to make sure it matched teh number on the bag. They match.  Next we had to turn the cadavors over onto there stomachs. once the were turned, Oh had problem with his one arm got stuck under him, had to reach in and pull it free. Something I was told always happens cause of the body being so stiff. Once they were on their stomachs I lifted while the others push the body forward to get the head to hang over the end of the gerny. When this happened the preservative ran from their nose. A bucket comes in handy *make a note of this.  Double gloved my hands got a scapple and forsnips. made insissions (superficial) grabbed a corner of skin and pulled back exposing a layer of fatty tissue. *I will describe this dissection in detail later. Once we cleaned teh fatty tissue away the muscle was exposed in the neck, back and gluts. Damn I am starving, thank god it is time for lunch.
