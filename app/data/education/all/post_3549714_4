Once known as "The city of lights".........karachi, has now completely transformed into a city that has lost hope ,it has plunged into darkness..........darkness of despair.....hopelessness...pain!!! The day started as a normal bright, sunny day...no one had a slight idea that its going to end up as deady as possible..... It was time for ISHA prayers,all the mosque's cried a voice of calling from God those who could hear it went straight ahead to say there prayers...the prayers started with the name of God!!............and then there was a loud BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!!!a loud noise that shook the building of the MOSQUE...all the lights suddenly went into darkness.......darkness that was frightening......that was killing......has something happened??.......was it a tremor??an earthquake??.........did the earth shake?........is the sky preparing to explode!! has the sky fallen down??....what was it????????....... IT WAS A BOMB BLAST!!! ............where?? in the MOSQUE!!....uhhhhh....how many people died?.....1 ...........2.........no its 12!!......ohhhh it's 15.......eventually its 20.......and hundreds hurt ..wounded badly........   the BOMB exploded in the mosque just when the prayer started!!!!    Death took over the city that was known for its brightness and life!!.......death of innocent people..cries of there loved ones....whispers of anger and hatred and protest are all over the place now.....insecurity is all over.......prayers are left unanswered or what...??? The darkness was deadly........there was blood all over the place...those who had gone to pray were killed for reasons unknown....or may b for being The faithful!!! Death took over the city..........questions that rose in the minds of people was....WHY??why were these innocent people killed.......why did they deserve to have a death like this......why were they chosen to die in that manner.......but who has the answers?? KARACHI, once had peace and happiness reflecting thru the lights sparkling out of the eyes of its people......and now those sparkles have been replaced by fear...fear of death.....fear of being burnt alive....when will this massacre end?.....when will the common man be safe enough in the city to dream of a healthy and safe life...........When will a common man look forward to a safe and secure day for  himself and his children.........who has the answers?? when death takes over...LIFE RESIGNS!!! life has always been playing hide and seek with death, sometimes its life that wins and other r the times when death takes over but now is the time when  LIFE HAS RESIGNED ...........it has been loosing enough to continue with the battle......when today in the mosque a small child lost her father,  life lost a battle  .......when an 18 year old in the mosque was desperately trying to breath but failed .. it was life again that failed ......life lost when a young energetic Doctor was burnt alive in the mosque leaving behind a beautiful wife having all the hopes of a happy life ahead ....it wasnt the Dr that died it was life that lost again......and now its time! life has resigned..and death has taken over the city KARACHI......once known to b the city of lights!!!........ when death reigns....... fear mounts and insecurity is the order of the day........ Lets hope that this city, dear enough to a lot of people doesn't end up being the city of deaths!!!
