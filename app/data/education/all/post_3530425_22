Came to blog, and found TM online and ready to IM.  A conversation with him has greatly improved my terrible mood.  Some bitching and joking--it's a good thing.  Juan is not going to last.  Maybe not even one more date.  He's surprised to learn some things about me, but he hasn't exactly been interested in what I might have to say about myself.  The first thing we have to do is fool around, then,  after  the nap comes the conversation.  (The conversation! The conversation!)  And most of the conversation is about him.  I pointed this out, and his feelings got hurt.  Tough.  The mantra:  I Deserve Better.  The boy could be history.
