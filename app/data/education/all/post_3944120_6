This completes the circle, I have now blogged from every computer I have access to.  Rejoice.     I'm hungry, but not the sort of hungry that you can eat on, you know?  It's the empty pit feeling that's almost painful, but also rather close to the nausea end of the spectrum.  I suppose I COULD eat, would give me a chance not to do some housework :)
