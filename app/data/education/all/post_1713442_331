urlLink Naked Librarians . This is a fun site showing women (who may or may not be librarians) in varying states of undress.  Some of them are drawings while others are pictures.  There is even a reproduction of a  Playboy  pictorial featuring a real librarian from the 50s or 60s.  I think sites like this help to liven up the image of librarians.  I like this quote from the site (which is unattributed), ""by the time a man can read a woman like a book, he is too old to collect a library."   From the site:  okay, it's sort of a cheat. they're not necessarily librarians and some of them aren't even definitely naked. even so, I find the juxtaposition of scant clothing and reading material compelling. hope you do too.
