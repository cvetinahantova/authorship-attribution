Talked to Rivers again this morning.  (How wicked is that?)  Found the *most awesome site ever*:  urlLink http://www.neighborhoodies.com   You make your own shirts, bags, undies, and of course  hoodies.   (i'm addicted to hoodies.)  Reading Seester's comments on her site I realized something wonderful:  Families are who you decide they should be.  Blood and sweat have nothing to do with them, although, I'll grant tears to be deciding factor.  Seester *is* my sister, regardless of heritage.  Monkeypants is my husband, in heart, and The Dictator's parent, even though they share no blood.  The H*Factor, HoJo, KissKiss, Christabelle:  These ladies are all my sisters.  They are my family because of what we've shared together, how we relate, and what I'm willing to do for them.  I would place thier lives before mine on any given occasion and risk everything for any one of them.  Scarily, I know that they love me as much as I love them.  I know everytime The H*Factor calls me at three in the morning that I'm important to her.  I know when Christabelle calls to cry because she's happy for me.  Or when KissKiss buys me shirts, even though she knows that we won't be able to see each other for a looooooooonnnnnnnng while.   These girls all support me wholeheartedly, loyally, honestly.  They aren't afraid to give me the brutal truth or to soften things when they need to be softened.  They know that sometimes I just need them for no apparent reason.  As for Monkeypants, any man who's willing to find another job just to make me happy, or watch my child so that I can take my friends out, well, if that's not dedication, love, trust, I don't know what is.  Families are wonderful!
