Ever have one of those days where you are just tired.   I went shopping today, grocery shopping, and beach shopping.   All 7 of us need beach clothes.  I lucked out and got my suit at Target uesterday, clearance rack, $7.  Whoohoo.  Tommy's was only $4.  Even better.  So today I had to search for the boys.  I went to Walmart.  I know some people hate wally world, but not me.   I love them.  Especially when I can get shirts for the boys at $2 a piece.  I actually bought myself two suits , Tommy hates the color of one (my favorite of course) and I hate the style  of the other one!  (to mamawish)   So which one to keep?   Then after shopping in Wally world for 2 hours, during peak school shopping season, I hit the grocery store wide open.   Went in for frozen pizza, came out with 2 buggy fulls of food.  I shop for a month at a time.  So it was monthly shopping time.  The only problem with that, is then you have to come home and put the food up.    Then you figure in the fact the water has been messed up for 2 days, finally got to shower at my parents house today.  Thankfully, I must say, the humidity and heat do not make a good mixture with no way to shower.  Especially with 4 boys who often forget to use deodorant.   We also made a trip to the dump today.  Not my favorite place to go.  80 degree heat and the county landfill, sheeeeewwwwww.  Casey must have wallowed in the trash, when he got in the truck, I had to make him strip down to his shorts.  TJ went the rest of the way home with his head hung out the window.  I didn't have that luxury.   I rode home with my shirt pulled over my nose.  Yes, it was that bad.   Now, Tommy is in bed, I am sitting here with my wild berry wine cooler, relaxing.  The boys are either playing the XBox, or doing something constructive, and leaving me alone.  Thank you God for small miracles.
