Rainbow   The prickly sharpened thorns Oh sweet smell of red roses Light reflects many new morns Morning orange hue proposes A new day and let the sun bloom Yellow lilies: sun has a class Of being sincere and broom The evil away from green grass I lie down and look up 'noon sky Royal blue calms me and I praise The pale purple clouds up high Above I and the humidity arise Rain shoots us the magicked arrows  And the birthing of rare rainbows  ~Kekua,  June 2004
