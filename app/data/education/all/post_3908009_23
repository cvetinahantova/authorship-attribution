JEBUS! last night was strenous enough. like hell i'm gonna let myself pig out after all that work. geeze. Pilates is a bitch. i didnt even kno i could bend in that many ways. actually, i didnt know that people were capable of bending in that many ways. shizzit man. oh yes i've sworn off swearing so i swear in secret. it just sounds dirty when a girl cusses. is that how u spell it? cusses? well i'm not eng prof. so i could care less if a rhino shot out of my ass while i was spelling.
