Ok.. this is my last blog of the day. I want to get teh hell out of here. The AC in the office is unsufferable. It's so damn cold. Really, I hate sharing my office with tons of people. Well, they are 8 .. but still, it's too much for me. I need my privacy.   My quest today is to find a way to post images in my blogs. Images are so much nicer. I hope I can find a free option of course.    Cheers!
