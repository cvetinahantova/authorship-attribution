This is a call out for any "morning" sickness gurus or those who know one. I don't intend to make this blog about my pregnancy in anyway. If I want to do that, I'll start a new one. However, the fact that I feel so much like shit right now makes me feel it necessary to cry for help. Anyone who knows of anyway to limit (or even eliminate) the wretched feeling of morning sickness, please let me know. I hate feeling like this. I'm actually having to carry barf bags that S  stole  procured from the station (as you may recall, he's a paramedic).  Please. Help. Me.  *sobbing in corner....awaiting a response*     UPDATE:   Thanks to the suggestions offered by sexysoccamom and Kalisah, I have begun feeling better.  I appreciate the suggestions and the well wishes from everyone!!!  :)
