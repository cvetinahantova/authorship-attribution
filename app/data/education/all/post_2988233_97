We have had a good day.  NOtice I said we.  We went over to Tommy's sister's house for a family get together over there, it was a lot of fun.  The boys played basketball against the men.  Which is too funny to watch.  THen we had a easter egg hunt for all the kids.    During the egg hunt, TJ and Casey were racing for a lone egg, and TJ tripped Casey, he landed on his elbow, and we think it jsut might be broken.  He broke the left elbow this time last year.  IT isn't a fun process.  He can't move it right now.  So we are watching it to see what it does.    Well, I am off to the hospital.  With me luck.
