I'm wearing a new dress that I bought today; It's knee-length, black satin with a ribbon under the bust and little pink polka dots. I'm also wearing an early Christmas present from daddy: Â£22-worth of pink hat from Oasis, plus my plain old black heels. In 2 hours I'll be going to see Hell Is For Heroes and I have no intention of taking this outfit off until the last possible opportunity. Why? Because I feel great- I looked at myself in the mirror and thought "Damn... I look gooood!!". So fuck you Birmingham, and fuck you, Rich, because I'm sexy and you both just missed out...  Ceff x   She likes the way I stare...
