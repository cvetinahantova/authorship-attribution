Whispered Anew  half a life down and someone whispered my name and my heart  stirred awake  I am left in awe of the passing years where loneliness has written my story that there may be a chapter left in me  love makes such a desired storyline that I do so want to read kindle this spark and invent me anew  Â©2003 DC Vision
