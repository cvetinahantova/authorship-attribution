hmm... just got back from the NaCLi camp , a.k.a SC camp, yesterday.. wanted to meet sam for bball.. but got to go home.. got home liao, realize i was very tired... so sleep early..  today actually planned to stay in bed the whole day de.. long time since i did that.. BUT!, my parent's room accidentally got locked up and coincidentally, both my parents' keys are in the room...  Here's where SPIDERMAN comes to save the day.. haha.. i had to climb from the window of one toilet, to the toilet of my parents' room...  (first, screw out the grills, then remove the glass panels, climb out, climb over to the other toilet on the 'roof', remove the glass panels of the other toilet, screw out the other grill and climb in to open the door from inside.) but, the screws of the grill in my parent's room's toilet were stuck and couldn't be unscrewed... HoW WaS I SuPpOsEd To EnTeR If ThE WinDoW Is GrIlLeD??!!!   so in the end, i had to 'fish' my mum's handbag with a pole while sitting on the 'aircon-generator?'... imagine the force i had to apply at 20cm from the pivot to produce a moment strong enough to lift my mum's handbag of weight about 3N at a distance of about 3m!  let the weight be 3N. 3N X 3m = ?N X 0.2m ? = 45N (about the weight of a thin person?)  haiz.. anyway, it was kinda fun lor.. since i like climbing around.. like rock-climbing.. haha.. so it was tiring and fun.. haha...  IN THE END: I got the keys from my mum's handbag as it was hung on the other side of the grill for my mum and th door is OPEN!!  My dad immediately took the keys and made a copy to be placed in 3 rooms.. haha.. over-cautious sia..
