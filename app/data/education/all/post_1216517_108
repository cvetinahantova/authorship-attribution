This is a pseudo autobiography i penned in spring 2002. It's pretty funny. I deleted anything that could incriminate my associates. Feel free to read what's left.  3-16-02 I don�t know how I got to be in charge of 900 people, but I was and I kind of enjoyed it.  Khaki pants, white polo, black shoes, belt and visor.  Not really me, but official and I had to play the part.  I was representing the university.  I was a paid staff member.  More than a figure head.  Much more, considering all the work I out in during the summer.  And what a dreadful summer it was.  Lonely.  Depressing.  My birthday was memorable, highlighted by Jacquie�s gift of XXXXXXXX and the out of control car games that ensued.  Besides that I worked in the Orientation office for the greater part of the day and at Edison International field for the greater part of the evenings.  I was a hawker.  I sold ice cream, peanuts, cotton candy, lemonade, and licorice ropes.  Preferably peanuts though.  They were the most fun.  You got to throw them.  There was a rule of no more than three rows and seven seats, but to hell with that.  Nobody cared.  I  just let the bags fly left and right.  On the last day of the season, I was at the bottom of the section and this guy at the top raised his arm and called out.  I wound up and chucked it with all I had.  The bag whizzed between the heads of two older ladies and landed in the guy�s lap.  I got a two dollar tip. I was alone that summer and kept myself going by laughing at Michael White, hawker extraordinaire.  Michael has hawked at stadiums in Atlanta, Cleveland, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Anaheim.  He says his middle name is �ain�t.�  I love the cafe.  All you can eat food.  And it�s pretty good too.  The cafe has been the sight of some pretty historic events in my life.  Today I was sitting outside on the cafe patio (my usual spot) and Jesse came out with a plate of three peanut butter squares with chocolate on top.  He said �I love these things.  I could eat nothing but peanut butter squares for the rest of my life.�  One of my favorite pastimes in betting Jesse to do things.  I said �I bet you twenty bucks you can�t eat fifteen of them.�  �Fifteen!�  he says, �I could eat thirty!� �Deal.� We shook and he ran inside.  He came back out with a heaping plate full of the squares and began to eat.  And eat.  Keep in mind he had already eaten a full dinner.    After fifteen he wanted to stop, but I reminded him that he was the one that had upped the ante.  Around number twenty-one we had to go to class.  Number twenty-three came during class and Jesse had to leave because he felt sick.  It was really a second reincarnation of Cool Hand Luke.  In fact I began calling Jesse that for about a week.  But that is just a reminder of the great cookie bet of freshman year.  Jesse likes to make absolute blanket statements like, �I could eat nothing but cookies for the rest of my life.�  Which causes me to say things like, �Oh yeah?  I bet you can�t.�  It was this exchange that led to the cookie bet.  The winner was originally supposed to get fifty bucks, but Jesse said he didn�t have enough money. And we all know that bets are more fun when the prize is something other than money anywise.  So it ended that Jesse was to eat only cookies for a week and the loser had to enter chapel by the back door in his boxers and in a bathrobe, go up to Brad Davies the student chaplain and say, �Hey!  What�s going on?  What are all you guys doing in my bedroom?�  Around the second or third day it was really getting to Jesse.  About that time is when I ordered a pizza to be sent to his room.  I�d also give good tasting and smelling food lying around his desk.  An incident around this time caused me to declare the bet null and void.  I discover that he had eaten animal crackers, a clear violation of the rules.  A cracker is a cracker.  There are such things as animal cookies, but those has frosting on them.  Animal crackers are frosting-less.  I was up in arms, but I let it stand.  He had garnered the sympathy of all the girls on campus.  I was the mean guy that wouldn�t let him have any food.  Go figure.  There were some girls that saw through to the stupidity he was inflicting on himself, but there were few and far between.  I don�t think it helped matters much when I again caused an uproar when I discovered that he was taking vitamins.  Obviously, a vitamin in not a cookie and it is a solid substance that is going into his body�food.  So no more vitamins.  And I still lost.  I never followed through on the bet though.  I�m not that stupid.  Today I really felt like betting Jesse to do something.  There were about 7 of us sitting around outside on the cafe patio.  I told Jesse to go stuff food down his pants.  So he walked into the cafe.  I didn�t think he�d do anything, but now he had a crowd.  That�s something neither of us can resist�an audience.  He picked the absolute worse things though.  He stood in line and got a plate full of spaghetti.  He looked around all mischevious-like then pulled open his pants like a drawer and tilted the plate so the noodles slid right down.  He walked back out side, but before the got out a big glob of pasta escaped from his left pant leg and stretched out on the tile floor of the cafe.  He got his applause though.  All this betting in the cafe is, I think, An attempt to outdo Rian Kennedy.  He has become infamous for the legacy of his bet.  Someone bet him 20 bucks to pee his pants, right there on the cafe patio.  Next thing you know, you heard liquid splattering on the concrete underneath his seat.  Everybody looked and lo and behold, the chair hovered over a puddle.  The seat was never washed to my knowledge.  The girls still cringe when it�s mentioned.  I don�t know what my greatest betting triumph would be.  I think I�d have to go back to high school�senior trip.  Me, Melvin, and Scott Krantz were sitting around Epcot Center in Florida.  I don�t know why Scott Krantz.  I talked to him all of 3 times in high school.  Anyways, everybody knows that Epcot Center in boring as hell.  Especially for high school seniors.  I take that back.  It�s got these dancing midgets and midget anything is exciting to me.  There have all these country sections there�Spain, France, Morocco, Japan, Italy, England.  It�s got them all.  We were sitting in Canada land of all places.  How boring can you get.  Canada land.  I think they had moose and fake snow there.  We were sitting on this little bridge looking at this giant fountain and as always, when I�m bored, I began to make up bets.  �I�ll jump in that fountain for 40 bucks.�  The unthinkable is the best.  I was eventually worked down to: I jump in the fountain, swim to the center, and climb the fountain for a pizza.�  I took of my shoes and socks and hopped this little fence.  I had to run though all these flowers.  I jumped in the water (it was pretty deep) and swam out to the middle.  There was no way I could climb anything.  But I look back and Melvin and Scott were gone.  I didn�t even see what direction they had run.  I was expecting to get thrown out before I had jumped in, but hadn�t planned on being ditched.  So I got out of there and run through Japan, Germany, Ireland, and Africa, before I eventually caught them in Israel.  I looked back and my wet foot prints had followed me the entire way.  Never got caught though.  Immediately afterward the three of us were sitting on a bench reliving our adventure when I noticed a fairly attractive group of girls staring at me.  One of them came up to me and said, �Do you mind if I kiss you?�  I�ve got a bet with my friends over there.�  I said that I didn�t have a problem at all and she kissed me on the lips no less.  Scott and Melvin called me a lucky bastard and I smiled for the rest of the the evening.  Today I finally decided that I needed to break up with Courtney.  It was at a Mimi's CafeXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXMany paragraphs deletedXXXXXXXXXXXXX  I don�t think I�ll ever be to go back there.  The whole lunch I couldn�t bring myself to do it.  I ordered a wine to calm my nerves.  I was shaking like crazy.  Finally she asked me how I was doing and I let it out about how I thought our relationship wasn�t working.  She got all pissed and wanted to leave.  So we did.  I took her home, rode home in silence.  And she started on all this about XXXXparagraph deletedXXXXXXX  What am I supposed to do.  I was still breaking up with her.  She made me cry.  I was genuinely sorry.  I felt like an asshole.  I wish I would have done it earlier.  I wish I never would have XXXXXXXXX.  I almost wish I never XXXXXXXXXX.  Give me some time though.  Trip up to San Francisco tomorrow.  The night in Big Sur will be one for the ages.  I�d never been there before. I acted like a jackass the whole trip.  XXXXXdeletedXXXX.  We headed up the coast on Friday.  I checked my voicemail that morning in San Luis Obispo and there was a message from Courtney the previous night at about midnight.  She said something to the effect of: �XXXXXXXXXdeletedXXXXXXXXXXX  Thanks.  Bye.�  That depressed me.  One of her friends called me while I was listening to the message.  XXXXXdeletedXXXXXXXXX.  Anyhow, I thought that XXXXXXX sounded like a grand idea.  So, while camping at Big Sur I XXXXX a XXXX and a half of XXX and half a pack of unfiltered camels and I don�t like to smoke.  I was loud and began to prophecy to Andrew about his life and made up funny songs to the tune of �What�s up� by the 4 Non-Blondes.  On the way up the coast we stopped at a pinata store and bought a Osama Bin Laden pinata.  I had spotted it outside the store while we we getting gas.  In excitement, I  bolted across the street and almost got hit by a car.  We tied Bin Laden to the back of Jesse�s Trooper and make a noose for around his neck.  We got so many honks and cheers and waves.  It was incredible.  I felt like a celebrity.  At the campsite in Big Sur we strung Bin Laden up in a tree.  I stuck knifes into him.  A couple of park rangers came and make us take him down.  Can you believe it?  Communists.  I was an asshole the entire trip or at least I tried to be.    We really XXXXX hard at the beginning of the semester.  I didn�t realize it until now. Things like the infamous XXXXX stepfather party where Jesse XXXXXXXXXXXXX and assaulted a few of the party goers.  Amy told me that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXNevermindXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  I found out that XXXXXXXnopeXXXXXXXXXX �Ok, well have a good evening.� Then Brent decides to add, �It�s all good.  It�s all good.� Thanks, Brent.  Brent said he talked to �The Dude� today.  Referring to XXXXXXX.  He explains it, �Have you seen his hair?  Long in the front, short in back.  Let�s face it, he�s a dude.�  Brent walked up to him and said, �XXXXXXX, right? He nodded. �So what�s this I hear about you wanting to XXXX Darren?� �Oh, well, I wasn�t serious.� �Yeah, cuz that�s just silly.� And Brent walked away.  Sunday: Jesse and I went to what was supposed to be Tony Gwynn�s last home game, but because of September 11th, That will be next week.  Jesse had bought the tickets in the middle of the season in anticipation.  It wasn�t a total loss.  In fact, it wasn�t a loss at all because the Pods were playing the Giants and we saw Bonds knock number 65 and 66 out of the park.  It�s great to be a part of history.  We were sitting in right field.  The percentages said that if Bonds did hit a home run.  It would be to us.  We took our shirts off and baked in the sun.  The stadium wasn�t even half full.  We both got those frozen lemonade cups.  Beautiful.  One hit 10 rows down from us and the other sailed over the centerfield wall.  For Gwynn�s retirement, the were giving away these posters.  I went around and picked up about 15 of them after to the game to sell on EBay.  I never will.  I�ll just have 15 posters sitting in my room.  After the game, since we were so close, we decided to go to Mexico.  I was feeling the traveling itch.  The bug.  Pretty much my whole summer had been wasted.  Not wasted.  Just consumed by orientation and busy work.  It would be a late summer mini-day road trip for me.  Jesse always talked about Roserito and the great lobster he had down there.  So we cruised down.  I felt adventurous.  I felt satisfied.  I felt the need to get out and experience life.  The lobster was delicious.  We made tentative plans to head down to baja for spring break.  We walked around a little bit.  It made me sad.  Kinda like vegas does.  Jesse showed me his El Jimador stuff that�s really supposed to do the trick.  He had had it out on a ranch in Montana that summer.  Coming back though TJ we somehow got totally lost in the city.  Jesse was freaking out as always and though were were going to die.  It was weird, we were cruising down the highway.  Then it suddenly ended.  We couldn�t go back because it was one way.  We were in some neighborhood.  We eventually followed this car down into a reservoir canal and back up the other side onto a road.  One thing we hadn�t counted on was the post-Sept 11 customs backup to get back into the country.  It took three hours to get back into the US.  I was selling peanuts on first base view when Bonds hit number 71.  We were playing the Rangers.  An old man yelled, �71.�  So instead of yelling �Peanuts,�  I yelled, �71.�  It was great.  Of course it wasn�t as exciting as when McGwire hit 62 freshman year.  Of course nothing ever is.  There were about 15 of us crammed into Dan Bush�s room.  And when he hit it we all went crazy.  It was intense.  I got very emotional.  It was one of the highlights of my life.  The whole chase with Sosa and all that.  It really brought me closer to the guys in the room.  I had just arrived at college and it really made me feel at home.  One of the guys.  I felt like I belonged.  After the last game of the season.  I went to get a beer after the game with Danny Neilson.  To him everything is: �Aww. XXXXXXXXX,  Yeah.�  The bar is between Edison field and Arrowhead Pond.  A Janet Jackson show had just got done at the pond and the bar was full of gay man and trying to be teenage middle age women.  Dany was hitting on them (the women).  He invited me to a bar in Fullerton and said we were meeting up with some Brazilian gal.  Halfway there he said she had a friend.  I didn�t care.  Halfway into he bar he said that she didn�t speak much English.  So all night I�m trying to communicate with my awful spanglish.  He ends up going home with the other gal and leaves me to take the non-English speaker home.  At least I learned how to say �left� and �right� in Spanish.  My mom kept bugging me about getting a job so I decided to get one.  I like jobs.  I want to have a lot of them.  I�d like to be a mailman, a waiter, a bartender, a dog catcher to name a few.  But I got, I think, the best job in the world.  I sell peanuts in the stands at baseball games.  I get in for free.  I went to Edison Field and walked around the stadium asking people where I go to get a job vending items in the stands.  They directed me and I applied for the job.  The lady I talked to tried persuading me to be a club runner.  �You�ll make more money,� she said.  Yeah right!  That�s everything I hate about baseball�the business man in his three-piece suit.  What a bunch of bull.  I am really not a fan of those giant Herman Muster shoes that have become ultra popular with the female crowd.  It makes them look like cartoons.  They are so over exaggerated. XXXXXno way in hell i will leave this inXXXXXX  It never really crossed my mind, but now I begin to loath it and cringe.  Am i just a shallow person.  It just fullers the fact that I could never be with her.XXXXXnoXXXXXXXXXX  We were sitting in the back yard and this kid rode his bike through the gate.  He just sat on his bike staring at us.  He looked about 10 years old.   �You guy�s have a Nintendo?,� he asked. �I have a Super Nintendo and a Sega Genesis,� I said. �The other guys would let me play theirs.� �You can come over and play if you want to.� �Now?� �It�s in a box somewhere.� �Oh.� He looked around. �Do you have any stuff I can have?  The other guys used to give me stuff.  They gave me a water bottle once.� �Um.  I don�t think so.� He went over to a refrigerator that we were planning to move into the house. �Can I have this?� �The refrigerator?� �Yeah.  Can I have it?  I want to put it in my room so I don�t have to go downstairs.� �No.  Sorry.  We�re going to use it.� �Oh.� He looked at Jesse who was sitting in a lawn chair tying on his laptop. �Can I have your computer?� �No, you can�t have my computer.� �Oh.  Ok.  Bye.� He turned and rode off.  I enjoyed my birthday.  I think.  I was pretty depressed about the whole situation for a while.  I didn�t have any plans.  I felt lonely.  Then Brent invited me to go to Long Beach with him.  He bought me a pint of Guinness and Murphy�s.  I appreciated the gesture and drank the whole pint, but wasn't that fond of the beverage.  I�m not a beer kinda guy. ****dated material (obviously)***** It felt good that he showed enough to care and all that.  In the evening, Jacquie came over with a cake she had baked for me.  It made me feel special.  And, she brought a large XXXXX of XXXXXXX.  Jacquie, Keith, Brent, and I played 31.  It;s this card game my grandparents taught me and with which they wagered many a nickel during the long winters they spent in the california desert.  But for my birthday, instead of nickels, we used XXXXXXX.  Loser had to take a XXXX of a XXXX.  Thing was, as the night wore on, those XXXX began getting bigger and bigger.  If the XXXX over XXXX, he had to XXXX his mistake.  After a while of getting XXXXX and XXXXXX, we said screw it and just XXXXX a lot of XXXXX.  Happy 21st.  This led to a giant XXXXXX binge over the semester.  I didn�t realize how much we had been XXXXXX until recent reflection.  I (we) were XXXXXX just about everynight, getting pretty XXXXX (i.e. XXXX).  So much so that Trevor XXXXXX because of it.  He XXXXX because we were XXXXXX every night.  Every Thursday was XXXXX Thursday.  With meant even more XXXXXX.  It all culminated into our house becoming just a giant pit of XXX.  I�d walk outside and there'd be people XXXXXXXX on the roof.  XXXXX emerging from XXXXXX after hours of not being seen.  And the XXXXX step-father night where Jesse was encouraged to put on XXXXXXX, whereafter he proceeded to XXXX in the corner of the room.  He also assaulted several members of the party.  Before going to bed, a bit XXXX myself, I convinced Jesse that he had said many XXX, unforgivable things to XXXX, a girl he�s always liked.  I think he began to cry.  Because of all this Trevor XXXXX.  Now I think it was a good move.  The house isn�t the greatest XXXXX.  Matt XXXXX came over one night for TT.  The mark of a first time XXXX is they continually talk about how much they XXXXX.  �I had four XXXX, three XXXX of XXXX, a XXXX of XXXX (I�ve hated XXXXX ever since that night I was caught wrestling the bathroom rug after a few XXXX), and, um, something else.�  He got XXXXX and went outside and XXXXXXX on Andy�s car.  Then he came back inside and lamented his XXXXXX state.  �This kind of stuff ruins XXXXX.  I can�t do this to XXXX.  She�s such a great woman.�  Then he started XXXXX.  I felt sorry for him.  I actually wasn�t the first time he XXXX though.  Him, Jesse, and I all went down to San Diego one night.  Matt had three XXXX in a XXX then we went to see �Saving Silverman.�  The whole movie Matt kept yelling, �Get it? Get it?  They�re �saving Silverman.��  It was priceless.  Matt is one of the most honest guys I�ve ever met.  He told a girl she had birthing hips once.  I think I was by accident though.  He also pushes and crosses the line at the most ackward times.  Sometimes he just says weird thing.  A bunch of us were talking about school work and Matt the comparison, �That�s like buying weed from a sting cop.�  One of my favorite phrases in the English language.   We�re a lot better on the XXXXX.  Except a few nights ago, after i got back from betting on some horses at Los Alamitos.  I was depressed because amy decided that we should spend less time together and i XXXXX a lot of XXXXX.  After fasting for a week.  I went home.  A bunch of the guys were playing a game downstairs.  I went upstairs and started banging on my guitar and screaming aloud as I could.  I heard them storm up the stairs.  Matt, Keith, Andy, Drew.  So I leaped down the stairs over them.  I was more of a crowd surf down the flight of stairs.  But it was truly majestic any way you look at it.  I came home one evening and decided to pull an prank.  It had been awhile and I didn�t wanted to get out of practice.  My current best prank was  in the wee hours of April Fool�s day freshman year.  I was in the bathroom pretending like I was throwing up and Trevor ran into Matt Warner�s room and said that I was throwing up blood and we needed him to drive me to the hospital.  I should have won an academy award for my performance.  Matt is honestly one of the nicest guys you�ll ever meet.  So he gathered up some of his homework in anticipation that we would be at the hospital for a while.  We walk out to his car.  One problem, this was the second time that evening we had pulled this prank, and Keith, the first victim, was none too happy.  He saw us walking to the car and tackled me.  Dan ran over and ripped him off of me.  By the time Matt turned around, Dan and Keith we rolling around on the grass.  Which wasn�t anything too unusual, except it was 3AM.  We got in his car.  I even had a bucket for effect.  My throat was beginning to hurt now. �Where�s the hospital,� Matt asked. Trevor was sitting up front, mostly so I wouldn�t make him laugh (He�s not the greatest for pranks because he gets such a kick out of what�s going on that he laughs.  I caught him a few times that night.  I an the other have am reknown for keeping my composure in the midst of pranks. Trevor said, �Turn right.�  then they arbritarially said left or right when we came to a stop light. I finally weekly muttered, �What day is it today?� Matt, thinking I was planning ahead to fill out the hospital forms said, �April 1, Heh, that�s kind of ironic, huh?� We all cracked up, but he still didn�t get it.  �It�s a joke,� Trevor said.  matt was a great sport.  He didn�t try to tackle me or anything.  Then one day, I came home after a whole day of helping Amy move into her new apartment.  I hate moving.  I hate it with a vengeance.  So I was frustrated, sore, the whole ball of wax.  I come home and the house is empty.  I see Jesse�s car key�s lying i the kitchen table in front of the window.  I said to myself, �That�s not too wise.  If they wanted to, somebody could easily steal his car.�  A grin swept across my face and a picked up the keys and backed his car out of the driveway.  I parked the car on the street just one block over then walked back tot he house feeling very satisfied.  But then I got to thinking, �If someone were to break into our house, they would just take the car, they�d take all our other stuff too.  So I went through everybody�s rooms taking cases full of CD�s, CD players, TV�s, laptops, guitars and put them all in my crawlspace in my room.  I hid my stuff too, to complete the caper.  Then I left to go see a movie with Amy.  I was estatic, like a little kid.  I thought I was the genius of the world.  What really helped my cause was that, not a month ago some neighbor kids walked into our house and took some stuff: a watch, a mini TV, a guitar.  Fate was on my side.  Most of the guys in the house had went down to a concert in L.A., so I knew they would be getting back around 1.  I stayed out with Amy pretty late, then around 1:30 I began getting the calls.  I didn�t answer them, but waited for the messages on my voice mail.  Drew and Keith.  Drew said in the most somber, funeral director voice ever, �Hey Darren, this is Drew.  Um, you�re gonna need to call us as soon as you can.  We;ve had some stuff go down here at the house.  Oh, do your have your laptop with you.  Bye.�  I laughed so loud and so much.  It was uncontrollable.  I eventually called Drew back up and he told me that some stuff had been stolen and that I should come back to the house.  Amy was still with me and wanted to get in on the fun so she came along.  As I turned down the street, I saw a police car in front of the house, so I quickly backed up and headed to Super K.  I had Amy call the guys and tell them that I was really upset and had went to a park and left her in the car.  It was beautiful  I went back to the house around 3 or 4.  I took all the stuff out of my crawlspace and placed it all neatly in the living room.  I tried to be a quiet as possible, but the stairs were creaky and I actually dropped the TV on t he ground.  I thought I had broken it, but it�s a stuff little sucker.  In the morning everybody was so happy and the fingers immediately pointed to Mike Sycz, friend and known prankster.  The charade lasted about a day until Drew and I went out to eat at this Indian place.  He was asking me about Amy and school when he blurted out, �So did you do it?�  I couldn�t help but laugh.  I don�t understand women I really don�t.  I really have to learn how to control my mouth too.XXXXXXXdeletedXXXXXXXXX  I�ve always wanted to get thrown out of a ballgame.  The closest I had got went opening day '99.  Jesse and I were in Oakland.  Clemens pitching for the Yankee.  It was a terrible day.  It was drizzling went the game started and just got worse.  After a while they stopped the game.  Jesse and I moved down to behind the Yankee�s dugout.  The delay lasted quite a while and people started going home.  The grounds crew covered the field with a tarp.  Jesse and I joked about running out and doing a slip and slide number.  We both said that if the delay lasted a half an hour longer, we�d do it.  It didn�t and we didn�t.  We did encounter of of my all time greatest baseball experiences though.  The game started back up and about three row in front of us was a guy decked out in a Yankee jacker and cap.  He was just cursing the A�s up and down, telling every player how much he sucked.  This lady behind us kept telling him to shut up.  He ignored her for a while.  Then he told to to suck a particular part of his body.  This caused her to yell at him even more, which prompted the Yankee�s fan to turn around, grab his crotch, and shake it at the lady.  The climax of this whole affair culminated with the Yankee�s fan replacing the �1...2...3...strikes you�re out!� part of �Take me out to the Ballgame� with �1...2...3...XXXXdeletedXXX!� and shouting that part as loud as he could at the lady.  I was amazed that he never got tossed from the game.  The rain picked back up near the end of the game and Jesse and I had to walk dozens of blocks across a very cold, very rainy San Francisco. 	My dream eventually came true though.  It happened at Dodger Stadium on a Friday night went the Cardinals came to town.  Jesse got tickets in advance in anticipation of Mark McGwire chasing the home run record again.  Unfortunately, Big Mac was out for most of the season.  But little did we know he would retire at the end of the season.  He never got into the game that night.  And I was mad.  In addition to the four seats Jesse had, I invited about 10 friends to the game.  And if you know me you know I love an audience.  We were sitting in the Left Field Pavilion, which is called the family section (no alcohol, even though Jesse, Dan and I sneak some beers in once) but is anything but.  The most diehard Dodger fans sit in the Left Field Pavilion.  I knew this.  Knowing that I wore a Cardinal Jersey to the game.  About the 8th inning, I was really getting upset that Big Mac wasn�t in the game.  So with the Cardinals leading 4-1 ?, I took my jersey off, marched down into the aisle, held up my jersey and shouted �Cardinals!�  I ran up and down the aisle.   Dodger fans taught me a little how the Apostle Stephen felt.  As soon as the dodger fans saw me they began pelting me with whatever they could get their hands on.  Popcorn flew, half drank soda flew through the air, Dodger dogs nailed me in the ear.  I saw the security guy approaching me from either side.  Somehow I was covered in ketchup.  They escorted me out of the stadium, took down my name, and gave me a lecture about why it�s not good to do what I did.  They were really nice. It was funny, because I had talked to the main security guy before the game and had asked him how rowdy it got on the weekends.  He probably though I had been planning this the whole time.  He told me that its good to root for your team, just not cause a riot over it.  He said that innocent people were being knocked in the head with concession because of me.  The security guy had asked me if I was coming to anymore games that weekend.  I said, �no.�  Then I came back on Sunday and watched Big Mac fly out a few feet in front of me to end the game.
