Following up on the Iraq-Halliburton story, I checked the contributions of Halliburton employees to the current presidential candidates in this election cycle.  So far, there only seems to be 3 direct contributions.  One is for $2000 to Bush/Cheney 2004 and two contributions of $500 each to the Clark for President campaign.
