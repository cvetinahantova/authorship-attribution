If she gets that job, I will for sure be getting a car, because I'll need my own so I can take car of my self...! Doom! ::spins around and dances:: OOOoo, I want a ford focus...     Isn't it beautiful?? ::huggles it:: I love you ford focus...  I'm watching Pokemon... something wrong with me? I think so... >.>...! Heh, I love Pikachu...! I'll admit it, I think he's adorable!

I'd catch a Vulpix and let it evolve into a Ninetails... I'd get all psyhic pokemon... then I'd kick Sabrina's ass(first season) and take over her gym... nah... I wouldn't want to have to deal with a gym... I'd want to go on adventures... but I wouldn't want to do the whole gym battling thing... just go on adventures to be away from home and meet people! w00t... I'd be all mysterious... yeah... kickass... ::writes story about it::
