I went on vacation once and I was with my family and some of my closer relatives.  My uncle, aunt, two cousins, my brother, my dad, my mom, and I...we were all sharing the same place.  We had a boat to go out on a lake.  We had a beach area to enjoy.  We had sunshine and we had so many places to just relax that anyone would have loved it.  But I got a little too into myself, and I started to forget how great things really were.  My brother did something to irritate me and I made a scene.  At the expense of my family, I stopped people dead in their tracks and started insulting my brother.  And I thought I was so right that people who got irritated at me were just as bad as my brother.  One thing I learned from that is my problem was foolish but better...I could've told my brother in private and not ruined all the fun people were having.  Spencer...you got a problem IM me.  This is something you don't need to involve others in.  New Beginning??? Let's ROCK!
