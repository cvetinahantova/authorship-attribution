urlLink Andrew Sullivan  takes Al Sharpton to task for his flailing comments about the Federal Reserve.  I'm no Sharpton supporter but his comments, whether you agree or disagree with them, did make a substantative point--we need a Fed that supports full employment and economic growth.  On the other hand, John Edwards completely whiffed on a question about the Defense of Marriage Act.  When asked about it,  urlLink Edwards said:    "what happened with the Defense of Marriage Act is it took away the power of states, like Vermont, to be able to do what they chose to do about civil unions, about these kinds of marriage issues."   Later, Brit Hume pressed him on this response and Edwards said:   No, the Defense of Marriage -- first of all, I wasn't in the Congress, I don't claim to be an expert on this. But as I understand the Defense of Marriage Act, it would take away the power of some states to choose whether they would recognize or not recognize gay marriages. That's my understanding of it.   That's completely wrong.  The Defense of Marriage Act says that one state does not have to recognize the marriage between two homosexuals granted by another state.    Why not go after Edwards on this?
