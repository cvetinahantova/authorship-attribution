Dear Journal,             April 19th- I went to Matt Tippett’s party.  I drank a lot, but not enough to forget the evening’s events.  Well, I did some regrettable things: 1.  I told Matt how I feel about him, even after all this time, and then I kissed him.  He pulled away, walked away and the next day, he remembered NOTHING, not a SINGLE thing I said or did!  I felt so sick, so damn REPULSIVE!! 2.  I stayed when Kim left; I should have left with.  #3 explains why. 3.  I made out with Marcus, after trying to hook him up with Kim.  I only hit on him AFTER he told me about the French kiss between Kim and Matt!  We got close to sex, but suddenly he was blew me off!!  He told me, nicely I guess, to get out of his car.  He said we should go back inside.  Hey Amy, REPULSIVE much? 4.  Rob and Walker were flirting with me.  Eww!  Rob’s weird and sleeps with his eyes ½ open, and Walker’s like my dad’s age!             I should explain.  I’m naive when I drink.  No, I’m friendly, that’s how I see it.  I’m a happy drunk!!  But Kim says I’m a drunken slut.  Josh says I’m basically I’m a drunk naive bitch.  People who are my friend or my sibling’s friends just see me as a fun drunk!             I saw Sarah though; she’s about to graduate from ECU.  I also saw Deena Szary; she goes to ECU also.  I also met two guys, Josey and Ander.  They’re black (so of course nobody wanted drunkard Amy around them); they were so cool.  Josey sounds like a talk show announcer; Ander was really quiet, but had sweet almond eyes.             April 20th- I saw the old trailer park; there were lots of changes.  Mama’s pissed at me for not leaving with Kim.  Don’t worry, Mama, I am too, but more so!  I missed Jonny’s first Easter.  Mama says,  “Did you forget you have two kids at home?”  “Its nice to see you’d rather not be spending Easter with them!”              Why argue?  After this past weekend why would I ever want to go out?!  It’s safe here, with my boys.  They don’t find me repulsive.
