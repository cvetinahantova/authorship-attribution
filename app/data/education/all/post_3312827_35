This is going to be quick since I need to get to bed...  Sweetheart is now perching on my finger in the cage... go budgie!  My boss Delores is a bitch, and I'm not the only one who things so.  Now I realize why no one wants to work during the day with her.  One of these days I'm going to tell her off.  Boy who was remaining nameless told me tonight that he has been dating someone on and off.  I'm glad he told me... he let me know that he wanted to be friends and didn't want to lead me on.  Nice guy.  Moving on...  my birthday is Tuesday and it looks like I'll be celebrating by getting drunk with Ryan on Monday night.  Anyone care to join??    Time for bed...
