Can you think of an activity that makes you dumber, not smarter? Do you learn anything from that activity?   No.  Acticities are a way to continually expand your mind.  Even if the knowledge base is in place, the activity has been taught before, students have shown mastery, actually participating in the activity should just "reinforce" the learning.  Making the transition from short term to long term memory.  How many times as a kid did I put the same puzzle together...50, 100, 1000 times?  It wasn't that I was learning something "new" each time I did the puzzle, I was just transferring knowledge and expanding my thinking each time I did the puzzle.  Maybe the 1,156th time I did the puzzle I wanted to put the pieces together by size or maybe by color.  Who knows what I was thinking.....that's just it...I was thinking.  So learning is constantly going on no matter what the activity.  BC
