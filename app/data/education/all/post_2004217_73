Life is good, life is great, I am fab and everything is right again. I got into Leeds! That particular piece of news sent last night into a frenzy of hyperactive dancing, screaming and quoting Finding Nemo. Everything is fabulous! I feel happy, slim and successful. I know where I'm going; I've got a purpose. Good things are happening to me, for once - Yay!   I've got this strange hyperactive energy, I haven't felt tired at all, in fact the entire opposite: I want to run around and shout and sing and dance because I know where my life is going! I know what I have to do to get where I want to go, and I know that I'll definitely be going there if I do it. Talk about motivation, huh?
