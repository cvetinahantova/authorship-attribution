There's this  blog chain  that has caught my attention.  It goes like this, you ask me  five questions .  These questions can be of any kind, but, it would be more fun if they were really  weird  and  out of this world .  You can ask anything, from the color of my favorite blanket to what's under my bed.  Just shoot!  After I pick the best ones, I shall post the answers on this blog and I also get to ask the person/s (the "poster" of the chosen questions) five questions, which s/he will also answer on his/her blog.  S/he will, of course, have to ask his/her readers to do the same so the chain would continue. :)  Thanks!  (You can post your questions on my Comment ( Your Thoughts ) Board.)
