I had my latest appointment last Friday. It was another waste of time. We went through the basics and although she didn't ask the right questions again, I made a point of just telling her all about the last few weeks in one big swoop. Right at the end of my "little bit" I happened to mention that I had had a letter from the mental health team telling me I was on the waiting list. They expect to see me in 3 months time, although haven't issued a date yet.  It seemed to act as a cue for her to say "right well in that case its pointless starting anything with you, do you want to make another appointment with me or just wait until the referral comes through?"  I chose to wait - stupid fucking incompetent cow! That might be a bit harsh, but its the way I feel.
