My daddy has excepted to jobby thingie in St Helens.  So we are definatly moving sum time.  Any way not dwelling on the present lets dwell on the past. i got and email last night. From dave godden. he was a guy was building a tower with becci and against charlie he didn't talk to me but got my email off charlie so he could talk to me.  So umm yeah i got back in touch and said that meeting up with him would be a good thing to do so long as we were with other ppl.  We might be meeting up this weekend so yeah that would be funny i guess.   Going back to the present if my parents don't find me a school i will be staying here for the next two years which would be fine and stuff but my parents would have to live apart for the week and only see each other for the weekends.  That would really suck. Never mind We are in the IT rooms doing RE and looking at paintings which is fun but not as fun as writing here. Better go
