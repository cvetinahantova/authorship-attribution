Tomorrow will be a sad, sad day around here.    Dale has to go back to work.  Tommy's work that is.  Seems they are having another promotion, so Dale has to take up his post on the show room floor.    I will miss seeing him out of the corner of my eye when I walk thru the living room.    Savannah will mis saying "hey" to her Dale when she comes down.  Renee will miss losing herself in his sea blue eyes.  Oh my Dale, my sweet, sweet, cardboard Dale, what will life be like without you?
