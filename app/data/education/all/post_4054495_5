Wow, a lot of changes have gone on in AWARE this past week. We are all forming an alliance! (Bar The Restorers, who plan on detonating a nuclear bomb and throwing a major hissy fit if Congress doesn't "reassemble" the Constitution by September 5th for their sick twisted endgame).  I was really disappointed to see Omniscient Eyes' posts. I thought with their previous nefariousness would be plotting the assassinations of all Ideltech employees, but it turned they were just solving the same puzzles as us mostly. They didn't even know the solution to their own puzzle!! Alecia even said that we would be "shocked" to see what had been discussed in their forums, but really there wasn't anything too surprising.  Some people are angry with the whole Hidden Alliance thing, but I like it. It's forcing us to join forces to fight a greater evil. Maybe it will all work out... I don't know.  I'll write more tomorrow or Thursday.
