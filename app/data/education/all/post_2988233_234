YOu may have noticed, or not that I haven't posted about the NBA finals.  Most sports finals, I post about, I watch them, and I get into them.  NOT NBA.  If I were to pull for a team, it would be Detroit.  I can't stand the lakers.  Kobe, and Shaq are not my favorite people in the world.    I can't stand pro basketball.  Just can't.  I like college ball, I go completly nuts at March Madness. Especially watching my Duke Blue Devils.  I even enjoy Carolina now that Roy Williams is there.  I like Roy, he is from my hometown!  Tommy is watching the game right now, so I am getting to play on the computer, without feeling guilty over not spending that time with my family.    Dale JR did good today.  I was soooo afraid he was gonna lose his points lead, but miracle upon miracle happened for him today, and he didn't.  I was truly amazed.  He finished 3rd.  WOW. AND increased his points lead to 98 points!  GOOOOO JUNYA!!!!!
