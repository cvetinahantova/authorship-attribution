Hi All,  Kate and I made it back safely to MJ around two this morning.  About thirty minutes out of IC we drove straight through the wickedest storm I've ever seen.  I looked over at Kate and said, "Do you think this is a fucking Tornado we're driving through?"  It looked like nuke-u-ler winter outside.  The only colour I remember was grey.  That's when we tuned the radio to an Emergency Broadcast Beep and a man saying a Tornado was touching down within miles of Vinton and that if you were in the area, you were to seek immediate shelter behind concrete walls.  Go little Ford Escort Go!  And it did.  We ran into a Pizza Hut yelling Tornado! Tornado!  The people there just looked up at us and kept on feeding.  We hung out for a while until the T-advisory was let down then made our way home.  The advisory said Iowa City itself might see some action.  Did it?  I hope everyone keeps on posting, because I'm feeling sad to have left Iowa.
