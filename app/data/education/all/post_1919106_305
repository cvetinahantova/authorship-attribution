The worse of this semester's courses is done with. Had the final today, and I'm terribly glad it's over. Plus, I got to get a nice buzz afterwards, and a decent conversation with a good looking girl. Can't complain about that, eh? As soon as the buzz wears off I'm heading back home for a good nap. Tomorrow I'm taking the car out to get new tires - I'll probably take it for a spin around Halton Hills in the afternoon - the roads there are pretty good for some nice cornering. The next final is on Monday, but it's a take-home exam, so I doubt it'll be that difficult. After that, all I have to worry about is grading the cs350 assignments, and probably proctoring the final for that course.
