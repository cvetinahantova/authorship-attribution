Am I an Artist?  I was asked this question by Shane in the response to the previous post.  The answer depends on what one means by artist. I am  not  a visual or performance artist, which is what one usually means when they say "artist."  However, that is not what Shane meant.  Am I a creator?  What do I create?  Do I apply certain principles and create a purpose in my creation?  Am I willing to destroy a previous creation in order to give birth to a new one?  In the context of the last post, the object by which the artist does his work is the self.  In this sense, I am an artist, although perhaps not a proficient one.  I have always tried to recreate myself; to reject who I was with the intent of becoming someone new, and improved.    I've used different tools to do this; leaving my home at 18 and joining the Marines was entirely motivated by the desire to become someone new, although in that case, I was giving myself to an institution with the intent that   they  would recreate me, rather than myself.  But I have long since destroyed that self as well, except for a few aspects which I considered worth holding onto.  There are key points in my life where I chose to change: becoming a philosopher as a Marine; leaving the Marines to go to school, becoming a Christian, becoming an atheist, getting engaged, breaking off the engagement.    These were more than simple actions; they each defined who I was.    Just like the easal of a painter, my life is an experiment for me; I try new things to see what happens.  Sometimes, the results are satisfactory.  Othertimes, a failure.  One must remain creative, new, changing, and active, while also using some principles of form, and a foresight as to what one wishes to accomplish.  And even when this is achieved, it is not satisfactory to admire one's work for more than a few moments before destroying it and creating something new.     How are you an artist?
