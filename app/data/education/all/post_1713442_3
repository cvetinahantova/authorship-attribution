urlLink SatelliteTV.cc - Dish Network Satellite TV!  As the new NFL season approaches, I realize that I probably once again will be unable to see many of the games of my favorite team.  I love the Bengals but they are so bad that they never put them on TV outside of Ohio.  All I will get to see is the Detroit Lions.  Yuck.  I am thinking of paying the money to get satellite TV so that I can buy an NFL package and watch the Bengals every week.  Who knows, they might actually be good this year...
