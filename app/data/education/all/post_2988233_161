I am exhausted.  Good exhausted, but still.  I went to super Walmart today.  It is only the 3rd time I have ever been in one.    Our city council decided several years ago to block a superWal, so we don't have one, yet.  I drove a hour to get to it.  It was great.  I love going in there.    When we lived in Vegas I used to love going to the grocery store, becuase they had everything.  For a small town girl like me to be able to grocery shop at 3am and be able to buy clothes, and furniture at the same store, well, that was jsut amazing.    I would have loved living in Vegas now, then I was too young and naive to enjoy it.  I thought everyone was going to murder me and leave my body in the desert.  I also thought I would turn into some evil person if I gambled.  Now, I would love it.  I would go out more, take advantage of the food bars, and visit all around Vegas.  I pretty much stuck to our apartment when we lived there.  There and work, all I ever did.  Unless Tommy was with me.  I rarely went out alone.  I was too scared to walk out to my car by myself.  So young.
