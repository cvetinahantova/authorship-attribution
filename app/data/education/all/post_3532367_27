I've fitted my amp in the boot and we have sound! I've hidden the boxes in the bin so that Sandra doesn't find out - silly or what, I'll have to tell her eventually. I've spent the morning, cutting out 3 huge holes in the parcel shelf for two 6"x9" speakers and a 10" sub woofer.   I had to take some medicine into school during lunch for my son, who claimed he had a headache too. It gave me an opportunity to see how the new lunch system was going and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. I couldn't get over how quiet it seemed to be.
