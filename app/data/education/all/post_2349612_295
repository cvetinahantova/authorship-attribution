re: prayer request from yesterday  so my 12 year old cousin is presently in surgery... she hasn't been able to eat or drink anything all week, so they're putting in a stent (sp?) now, and she'll have to have another surgery next week to follow up unless they miraculously catch the stone today.... she's been in intense pain the past couple days and not responding to any medication... here's to hoping it all turns out ok...
