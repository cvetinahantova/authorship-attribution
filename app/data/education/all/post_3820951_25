as the title goes, i have a gazillion papers to write..  this morning, during the montessori training, we realized for sure that our fellow trainee who cried yesterday because she got ribbed by our trainor, will not be back anymore..which is really sad as she was already one of the very few who made it past phase 1 of the application..lots of other hopefuls would have done great things with the opportunity given her..i guess her ego was really hurt that's why she quit just like that. our trainor said she was just challenging the girl who suddenly didn't show up, she should have been open to suggestions since it was for the trainee's own improvement. anyway, to each his own, right? i just hope that that person who suddenly left realize that criticism doesn't necessarily mean negative criticism, it can definitely be constructive criticism (which is really how i always remind myself to see it every chance i get). and more often than not, that's the purpose why it was given to you in the first place, to help you along the path of realizing your best self..  every one in my class seems to be afraid of ms. alcantara, the head of directresses (who is also our very commanding trainor)..i would hav reacted the same way too had i not taken my first term of master studies this term. the lessons with ms. chichi are really helping a lot..it's just so wonderful i can recite and talk with confidence now than before when i'd rather blend in the background. yes, evitz is working on improving herself and is very excited about this work every day and night!  the papers i have to make before the week ends: album for maria montessori psychology classes, DAP for saturday, thesis proposal revisions also for saturday (ideally), and the developmental profile of the preschool child, Ashley..
