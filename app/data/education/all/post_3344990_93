I finally have the time to do a blog about our trip to Texas and I can also insert some cool pictures and SHOW you who some of our friends are.        Katy and Paula Bush at Kitchen Table in Garland Texas. Paula and Katy were childhood friends.          Rachel Bush sitting at Computer        Katy meets Melody Morris for the first time in REAL LIFE!!          Katy and Karen Perring in kitchen at Robstown Texas just outside of Corpus Christi Texas. Karen was Katy's High School friend.          After the memorial service for Hal Eads on South Padre Island on Saturday we left on Sunday morning and spent the day in Richmond Texas with Carla Meuth.  Carla Meuth is a teacher at Sugurland Middle School who Katy worked with before we left Texas.           We left Richmond Texas on Monday after visiting with Carla Meuth and headed for Picyune Mississippi to visit with Dawn Vaughn who Katy knows through Circle of Friends elist. This picture shows Dawn and her 7 year old daughter Savannah          Our furry family members awaiting us when we arrived back in South Carolina
