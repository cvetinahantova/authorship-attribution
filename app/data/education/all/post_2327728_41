Ok, since making the committment not to rag on Halifax anymore, I have come to realize that it is not the worst place I can be. I am getting used to it, and I have found my niche. I can't say that I am really happy, though.    My horoscope for the coming week:            The astrological omens suggest that I should urge you to be far bolder than usual. They even seem to be saying that the more brazen you are, the bigger your rewards will be. In fact, Scorpio, if I'm reading the signs accurately, you might want to draw your inspiration from the 40 starving artists in Paris who broke into an abandoned building near the Louvre a few years back. They built studios inside and have been squatting rent-free ever since. Now the city of Paris has bought the building and is paying $3.5 million to renovate it so that the artists can continue to thrive there. Be like them.   *sigh* How to be bold... what boldness can I undertake, and for what purpose? I just want to be happy here, and right now I have a smile on my face but it's fading. I will grin and bear it for a few more weeks, and then... and then... and then. I should stop writing in my blog, for one.    So, part of my unhappiness comes from a cancelled trip I was about to take. I was going to go to a university in Ontario for a month to complete an fMRI research experiment, but the magnet at the Robart's Institute is fubared, so the trip has been postponed indefinitely. I was really looking forward to this being the highlight of my summer - getting out of this city, and getting some perspective, plus seeing some friends in Toronto.     Darren, the witty new addition to our lab, tried to cheer me up with my  favorite ,    fuzzy grapefruit slices this morning. How very thoughtful... Darren, am I detecting a crush?
