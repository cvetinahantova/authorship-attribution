From her astonishing face, to her bright brown eyes.. her wonderful shaped body, and beautiful brown hair... everything about her is nearli perfect, no ones perfect, but i would have to say she is the closest that i have ever met. Her personality glows like a flickering candle in the wind,Â when no ones knows their wai, they alwais know where to find it... because she is alwais there... Her smile is stunning, all eyes capture her splendor, as if to sai, such beauti has never lived... Nothing has possessed her to be anything but wonderful to people that she meets. And as for me, I must be the luckiest out of them all, for me to have such an astonishing friend, for me to have such a smart, breath takingly beautiful friend, for me to have anything of the sorts, I must have lucked out because she is the best thing i could have ever asked for. If i asked for more, I would have to reach for a star as bright and as beautiful as her, perhaps, this is seemingly impossible, and i congratulate anyone who succeeds for she is beyond belief, for she is shocking, and if anyone was to doubt, to hell with them, because the true meaning of best friend is the best 5 letter word ever invented, ever named, ever born. And she is more than the world could ask for, more than it could dream, because having something this close to perfect must be a fluke... But its not, it all comes with the true talents, that she has earned... All of her is the most amazing thing ever built, or perhaps known to man... All i know is that she is real, as real as can be, and no one can be better, even if they tried their hardest... I love you megan, with all mi heart, I hope you love me too... Because you mean so much, and if i lost you, i would be lost forever without your smile...  (haha i am so cheesy, I hope you like it, I almost ran out of adjectives)... *mwahs* *let me rest in pieces*
