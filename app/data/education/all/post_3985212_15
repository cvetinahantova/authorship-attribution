Ok, so we've got PPP (prayer pet peeve) #1 covered. On to #2.  It bugs me when people use the many holy names of God as filler (instead of saying ummm...or errr....they say God, Father, Lord....etc). Here is what I mean:  Oh Father, please help us, Jesus, to know you God, better Lord.  For crying out loud! Are you trying to get His attention (you've already got it, duh!) or can you just not think of anything else to say? Maybe you're just trying to be more holy by calling God the many names that he has??? I dunno!!!  Does this bother anyone else?  Signing off.....  Current mood......extremely tired.
