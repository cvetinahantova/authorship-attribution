Ok....Some of you already know that I recently joined Weight Watchers. Let me just tell you. I love it! So many people say....."All diets are the same". True. I'd agree with you there. And all diets are hard. However, Weight Watchers is not a diet! It's a lifestyle change. And you know what else? Changing your lifestyle is even harder than a diet, but it's long lasting, unlike most diets.   I have been on this diet for 4 weeks. I have lost 10 lbs. I know, you can loose more on the Atkins diet in a short period of time. But the question is, "Can you stay away from carbs for the rest of your life?" I would have to answer that with a no. Will it do your body any good to eat lots of fatty foods for years to come. I doubt it. Atkins is a good "quick fix" for those times when you want to lose a quick 6 lbs. I wouldn't recommend it for more than that though.   With Weight Watchers, you eat 5 servings of fruit and veggies per day, 6 eight ounce glasses of water, and 2-3 servings of milk. You also eat foods that are low in calories, low in fat and high in fiber.Â  However, you may eat foods that are high in fat and calories, but they take up more of your allotted daily points. You can also earn points by exercising. Gee, sounds like being healthy, doesn't it?   I just wanted to say here that if you are one of us in the world who is overweight, don't be! You can do it! Group meetings are wonderful. You go once a week for under $10. You get weighted in and rewarded for lbs that you have lost. You get encouragement and tips from other Weight Watchers. The website is also a great place to go.  urlLink http://www.weightwatchers.com    If I can do it, so can you! I will be posting some low point foods, recipes and tips for weightwatchers on here in the future, so keep your eyes open!   Signing off.....
