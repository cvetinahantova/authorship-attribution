Well the checkup at the dentist went well today.  I guess I haven't been to the dentist in over a year but apparently I did a good job b/c he kept commenting on how "mighty fine" my teeth were.  I kinda think that b/c I was in Dublin Ga. that he gets a lot of not so "might fine" sets of teeth in there and has to deal with that.  Anyway the interesting thing is my mouth felt so much cleaner afterwards.  He said I need to floss more which, admittedly I do need to do.  I was a little under and hour drive away but since I didn't have insurance it was well worth the drive.  Everyone in Warner Robins is insured by the military so all the dentists and doctors here change a crazy amount.  Today I received mail from Scott Kim confirming that he has received my stuff all safe and sound.  He said it will take a week to process and then after which I'll be able to come back and get going.  I also got and e-mail from Gabe.  That was a pleasant unexpected surprise.  I can the comment box didn't fully explain I would like to say I don't think Andrew's blogging habits are terrible, I just wish he'd write more like everyone else.  Becky's blog is really good and interesting.  I wanna add a link to her page but I don't know her very well and I figure I'll ask later when I'm back in Korea.  I enjoy Caleb's drunken blogs a lot.  You get that drunken raw honesty thing going on which is always fun to try and make sense of.  I'm debating buying a digital camera.  The only thing holding me back is that I won't have a computer in Korea, but I'm not sure that really matters b/c you can just have them printed out like regular pictures.  That being said I've debated buying a laptop but I think I'll hold off unless I come across an absolutely amazing deal.  Ok now I'm gonna go try and tack a crack and making another web page or something.
