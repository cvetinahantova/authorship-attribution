in the dark with only the light of the monitor to show me where to go. i have no other, there is nothing for me... what is this, i try to write whats in my head and things that i dont understand come out. i want to know, let me understand. are you doing what i was so used to doing? i want to know, why if so? ive thought of it all and lost every bit of it, there is no end. youve done something with the mind hammered onto what it should be, but there are others that think differently. there are others that want to think what they benifit from, there is no end. why was there so much chaos... why the fuck was it so hard, is that really why that was how it was? or was it the many years of complete control and the crack of the whip, was it the sight or the whip... which one...? you think so differently of what i mean, you dont hear what i really have to say... you dont listen, you seem to but you really dont. i wish i understood, though everyone does. there always has to be pain... you say you will but you block it completly and do the thing i dispise the very most... you think i am what im not, you dont know me as well as you think. i hate it so so much, but you think its fine... i never wanted to but it was forced, you couldnt handle what it was and did what you shouldnt have. theres no more room for hypocricy, deal with it or stop it yourself. PLEASE!!! i hate it so much!... how am i still here, i dont know how i managed to stay and take all the shit in... is what i feel true? is it all real? does it seem right? i dont believe i want to take the risk of knowing... i cant take it, i need my corner. i need my gun. i need my life. i need my lock... its so very tempting to do what will release you from the pain and pressure all towards the center of one. will i ever have rest, will i ever have peace, will i ever have a clear uncorrupted mind, i think not...
