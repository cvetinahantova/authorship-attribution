I seemed to be a fountain of emotions today.  Just spilling over and crying at the drop of a dime.  Strangely enough, however, there was hardly a dime to be found in the fountain at Library Mall.  Which makes me wonder, why?  Here are my hypotheses: A.  The fountain was just cleaned out by city workers and the money was donated to charity. B.  The homeless folks went wading last night in order to get today's cup of coffee and a Subway sandwhich. C.  Sadly enough, people are making fewer wishes. D.  People have less change in their pockets or need to put it in the change jar. E.  The ducks that were there mistook it for food and ate up all the change. F.  One college student got smart and in order to recover from the tuition hike, she makes nightly trips to the fountain.  I made arrangements last night to have my going away party for work at Muramoto Japanese Restaurant.  So the evening of July 12, we'll all dine there together.  It's bound to be a hard night.  But tomorrow will be an even harder day unless I get my butt to bed.  So after watching the anti-capitalist, Michael Moore movie, "Roger & Me", I ponder: "How do the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer?"  I too contemplate nightly trips to the fountain.
