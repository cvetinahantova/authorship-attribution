He began to make his way out of the room as he finished buttoning up his shirt, but had to stop when he reached Catrina.  He slid his hands inside the sheet and pulled her close to him, spreading his fingers out along the small of her back.  Catrina tried to remain cool, but she felt him harden against her, and she could barely help herself.  Dex raised one hand to the side of her face, grazing her breast on the way by.  He kissed her fully on the mouth.  As Catrina returned his advance readily, circling her arms around his waist, her sheet dropped to the floor.    Dex pulled away abruptly, loosening his hold on Catrina.    "I have to go.  You have no idea how sorry I am, Cat."  Catrina winced.  She had never been particularly fond of that version of her name.  She let her arms fall away from Dex, and said very quietly, "You have to do what you have to do," in an effort to leave it open, so that he might understand that she herself was something that he very much needed to deal with.  Dex smiled and traced his finger along her cheek and down to her collarbone.  He gave an apologetic smile, before turning and walking out the door.  Catrina stared after him, mouth agape.  She had thrown herself at Dex, and now stood alone, naked, and getting increasingly annoyed, in her bedroom.  Sitting down on the bed, Catrina sighed.  As her anger faded into a feeling of should-have-known-better, her arousal, surprisingly, would not subside.  Considering her options, Catrina reached into her bedside table for her box of goodies.  Rummaging through them, she paused to think.  This was supposed to be an exciting night, passionate, not her alone with some double a's.  Before the disappointment could settle in again, she came up with a brilliant idea.  A smile slowly spread across her face.  She would not let this night be a waste, and she knew just who to call.
