This Lifestyle Can`t Last Forever!       I guess one could quite easily say that I have been bit by the travel bug and just can`t manage to recover.  I love exploring different parts of the world, meeting incredible people, and just having amazing experiences and learning about myself, the people around me, and just life in general.  However, I have recently been reminded of why this can`t go on forever (well there are many reasons but this is the one I am thinking of now).    When I left Australia I had to say goodbye to some incredible people.  People who had such a major impact on my life in general.  Now I am realizing that once again some very hard goodbye`s are beginning. I said goodbye to a couple of teachers last week and soon I will be saying goodbye to one of my closest friends in Japan.  I now realize that if I were to continue this lifestyle for too long, I would continually be meeting incredible people and then as soon as close relationships were formed, I would be leaving and moving on to somewhere else.  I think after a little while I will be tired of having to stay in touch with friends and family in the U.S. through emails and phone calls and having loads of friends scattered around the world but who I rarely ever get to see.      I am not ready to settle down just yet, but I am beginning to realize that with this type of lifestyle comes many really incredible things but there are also some things that this lifestyle prevents. These things might just be the most important or valuable things to me and my future!
