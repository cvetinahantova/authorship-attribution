How can I be fool enough to allow myself to be swayed by the nasty attitude of Jorge, he loves to make a fool out of me! I hated him for that. Last night he got into my nerves..really! He love it more when I get so mad and so damn bullshit..makulit talaga, nakakainis as in! Sakin pa talaga nagpabili ng ulam kahit anlakas ng ulan..sobrang inconsiderate...ay bahala na nga siya, magkakaroon lang ako ng heart disease or dis-ease!  Anyway, I plan to study now, to go to the doctor before I'll have this serious tubercular or lung virus or whatever you call it. I'll see him then to give him the money (kailangan nyang bumili ng gamit) then they plan to watch the controversial documentary film of Imelda, I bet it will be  very "imeldific" this afternoon or evening, I think so...  I just have to live each day enjoying and savoring each moment that he is still here, we are still together. Perhaps parati akong naiinis sa kanya kasi gusto ko lang maglambing or because this is part of the pain of separation...ha ha ha, can't believe I am saying this! In any case, I love him so, without question and without doubt!  I  am always and always GRATEFUL!
