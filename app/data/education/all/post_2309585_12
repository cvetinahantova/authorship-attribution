Ok, I'm sitting here in my NEW HOUSE (finally got moved in and everything!) watching "The Simple Life" on Fox. You know, the one where Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie go to live on an Arkansas farm. And I thought it'd be only right to dispell a few myths about my home state...  1) We do not all live in the country. Granted, we don't have HUGE cities like L.A. or New York, but we do have towns and cities. 2) We do not all live on farms. In fact, in the 26 years I've lived here, I've never milked a cow. I never even saw a live chicken until I was 17. 3) We are not all uneducated. Granted, there's a lot of ignorant white trash here, but we've got a whole lot of college grads here. 4) We actually wear shoes. It's acceptable to go barefoot at home in the summer, though. 5) We don't hang out at Wal-Mart all the time. We will, however, go there if there's absolutely NOTHING else to do. And we do stuff like  urlLink this .  There. Felt good to get that out of my system!
