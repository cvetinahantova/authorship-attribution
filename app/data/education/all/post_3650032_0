These pics are from a bike ride to the north of Yonezawa. I was guided around by Andrew (a 2nd year ALT also stationed in Yonezawa), and we spent most of the time following the main river out of the city. I spent much more time biking than taking photos, so there isn't much to show unfortunately. Should be exciting for river fetishists though.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
