Blog, blog, blog.  More blogging.  I plotted two really nice maps of the Big Island - prepping for the trip next month.  I can't wait to be back on the volcano and also on the beaches.  I'm looking forward to some relaxation time...  I'll give Noah and Amanda a copy for their wedding present and put the other on my wall to peruse 'til trip time.  Also need to get Laura's email address.  I've emailed her twice in the last month or two, but no response.  She probably switched emails and the one I have for her is out of date.  I also want to get webcams: one each for her, my Yawski, and me so that we can see each other and the girls can see them with video email...
