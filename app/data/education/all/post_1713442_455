urlLink Effective Approaches to Teaching Young Mexican Immigrant Children. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by de Atiles, Julia Reguero and Allexsaht-Snider, Martha.   It is about teaching Mexain students in the USA.  From the ERIC Digest:  Of the 22 million children currently enrolled in schools in the United States, more than 2 million have limited English proficiency (Macias, 2000). Preschoolers and elementary-age children make up the greatest proportion of the immigrant student population. Given these demographic trends, many teachers need support in educating young children from diverse linguistic backgrounds (Soto, 1991). The following review outlines strategies for working with Mexican and other immigrant children. The effectiveness of these research-based approaches has been affirmed by teachers.
