Ah, okay, somehow all that midnight cheer just drifted away. I think I should go to sleep soon.  I'm listening to Depeche Mode right now... The music I listen to seems to affect my mood.  Depeche Mode - depressing Nirvana - apathetic The Cure - hopeful The Smashing Pumpkins - sad Twisted Sister - rebelious Britney Spears - suicidal Great Big Sea - happy Duran Duran - howly The Beastie Boys - gangsta The Beatles - like a walrus The Ramones - punk Cake - murderous (can't figure this one out myself)  Well, those moods don't always apply. When I'm really happy, nothing will break the energy.   I've switched to Sheryl Crow and now I feel vampiric. lol. I'm a vampire >> ^w^   Sleepy time!  ...I don't really listen to Britney Spears.
