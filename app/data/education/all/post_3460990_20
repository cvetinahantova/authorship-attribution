Okay, so things are going. They aren't necessarily going well, but they're still going.   Honestly, this doesn't even feel like it's happening to me.  One minute I'm staring into space, the next I'm bawling. Then nothing.    I don't know what to say at this point. There are things that neither of my parents will never see in my life, and that makes me angry, and sad. And really, in a way, thinking about that helps me to deal with everything that's going on. I guess I figure if I can list out all the important events that I should know they won't be attending, then that fact won't be able to sneak up on me later.    My first day of school as a teacher, my Master's graduation, my wedding. I never imagined that neither of my parents would be there.    There's that saying about what doesn't kill us makes us stronger, and I believe that. They just never tell you that sometimes that one thing that doesn't kill you might try to kill you again at every important event in your life from then on.
