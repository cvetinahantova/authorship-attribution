ok, i was honest. i had to go though, so i don't know how he reacted! Here's a part of our conversation; ben's name was "(8) Looking for some hot stuff baby tonight (8) Stop looking, here it is!!! ;)" and he asks me if i agree... -----------------------------------------------------------------  Ben...       watcha think? u know u agree!!!  Ben...       lol   Charlie...   ha ha  Charlie...   :P   Ben...       wat dont u think i sexy?   Charlie...   of course   Ben...       is dat u agree, or u disagree?   Charlie...   i can't tell if ur just joking around or if u serious  Charlie...   (q)   Ben...       course i just joking around  Ben...       but it wud be interesting to know some proper truth!   Charlie...   well, don't ask me!  Charlie...   (alien) i is just some random alien   Ben...       come on i need to know what each of my friends think, so dont be               embarassed to say da truth   Charlie...   you 'need' to know?   Ben...       course i do  Ben...       brb  Ben...       having me tea   Charlie...   k sure   Ben...       stay online tlk to u after   Charlie...   k  Charlie...   ok, so while ur not here i'm going to talk 2 u!  Charlie...   and here's the answer to your question - no, i'm afraid i don't find you               particularly sexy, but if it's any consolation i seem to find very few               people sexy  Charlie...   i hardly ever just fancy ppl :(  Charlie...   of my own accord  Charlie...   i guess i shouldn't ask if you think i'm sexy ((q))... maybe i'm a little               young..?   -------------------------------------------------------------------- Ben didn't come back online before i came off, and i haven't had the chance to speak to him since. I couldn't resist asking that last bit at the bottom... how could i? Hee hee!   By the way the reason i'm not at school today is i'm really not feeling well and i'm all weak and shaking (bleeeeuuugh). Also, i'm posting this by email and i don't know whether it will work or not.
