Hey! How is everybody? I'm fine. I was just watching Phillmore... some kids show on ABC. Anyway, tomorrow is the only thing that's saving me from going to school. (meaning I have one day left before school... not fair...) Clint and Cody are washing cars at Walmart. Mom's working... at Walmart. Dad's working in Mitchell. So, I'm all alone and bored.       Mostly because Lauren isn't on because she's having a yard sale. I hope she makes some big profits today. That'd be cool. *Lauren... save the money ... you might need it to help your church get Slingshot 57 in... alright, here's what you do: 1) yard sale 2) get money 3) split your money into 4 piles... 4) 2 piles, you can spend on whatever you like; 1 pile, Slingshot 57 concert next Friday... buy something!; 1 pile, save for the Slingshot 57 fund of your church ... that way you can have them come for a concert... Isn't that a good idea?! I know it is... that's what I do... If you get change,put it in the fund; or if you feel like putting in a few $dollars$, go ahead and put it in the fund. It's that simple... and you get more $money$ raised that way for the concert. It'll help your church soooooo much. Our church hasn't started raising money for it yet. I wish they would.      Anyway, I'll talk more later.      Silent
