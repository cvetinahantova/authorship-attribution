I went to a wedding last night that was for someone I didn't even know.  It was poorly executed, poorly planned, and even moreso; it was tacky.  It was a "traditional" italian wedding, but it really wasn't.  They played music that was popular in the 50's in Italy, not things that were popular now.  So it begs the question, what is it to be Italian in America?  I find that being italian somewhat myself, this question is of some importance to me.  Italian-Americans try to identify themselves with an Italy of yore.  The Italy that actually existed while their grandparents or great grandparents experienced.  How long can this nostalgia last?  Italy has evolved well beyond the days of Al Martino's crooning or Louis Prima's frenetic lyrics.  This simply becomes a caricature of what really is Italian.  I think those who have real knowledge of their italian heritage would be repulsed by this.  It is insulting to them to think that their culture is one that never progressed, and grew a culture of mobsters and scumbags.  This stereotype must end, and only will when Italian-Americans stop perpetuating it.
