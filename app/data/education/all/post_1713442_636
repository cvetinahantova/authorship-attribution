urlLink Afterschool Programs. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Linda Lumsden.  From the ERIC Digest:  According to Jodi Wilgoren of the New York Times (2000), recent growth in afterschool programming "represents nothing less than the reimagining of the school day for the first time in generations."    Afterschool programs are increasingly viewed as one viable way of bridging the gap between the end of the school day and the time parents get home from work. They have the potential to provide a safe, supervised place for children and youth to participate in constructive activities and form positive relationships with peers and adults. Such programs may also supplement what children and youth learn during the regular school day and expose students to a wide array of enrichment opportunities that promote cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and moral growth and development.    The caliber of afterschool programs varies widely, however, and so it is important for administrators and policy- makers to be familiar with factors that tend to set apart high-quality programs. Otherwise, millions of children may end up being "warehoused in inadequate programs" (Grossman 2002).    This Digest briefly discusses why afterschool programs are needed, what potential benefits may be, what challenges may affect the viability of programs, what factors are identified with high-quality programs, and what policy issues need to be addressed.
