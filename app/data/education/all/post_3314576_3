I don't have much time today to write.... or think for that matter.  I just spent the entire day scoring our portfolios.  I'm pretty happy with how my scores turned out-- the ones that scored an apprentice were not a surprise, but most of mine scored a proficient.  In case you are reading this and are unfamiliar-- I could go on for years about our porfolios and testing, but basically--- My kids could have scored a novice (not good), apprentice, proficient, or distinguished.  Usually, we don't have many distinguished.  A distinguished writer is not the sort of writer you teach-- it's the portfolio that gives you goosebumps.  In fact, I hear that you can conference a kid right  out  of distunguished, but not  into .  I'm not going to be Lucy's favorite person tonight because I am home for an hour and then I'll leave for another 4hrs. to listen to interviews.  We have an opening at our school and there are 4 interviews tonight.  I'm so whooped!  It was a good day though. I can't believe that there are only 7 days left of school though!  That seems so crazy.    Other stuff- I can hardly wait for my mom to come and visit.  I harrassed her about visiting for months and now she is!  Do I feel guilty about this?  Naaaa....... I may have guilted her into it a little, but it's not like I was convincing her to want to come... I was just convincing her that she should come sooner than later.  7 months is a long time to be away from home!  For me at least ;-)  I think my longest time without going home or seeing my fam. is 9months.  Mass craziness!  Well, this is kind of a boring post, but oh well :)  Gotta run...........  Ooh, I need to remember to post about my adventures last Saturday.
