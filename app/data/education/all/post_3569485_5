Okay, so every year my dad and I go shopping together and he picks out what he wants for father's day and I pick out what I want for my birthday. So on the day before father's day, he called me and he said that we should get our shopping done so we didn't have to do it the next day. He told me that he wanted a portable vacuum cleaner and that it was around twenty dollors. I told him I would get it for him because i was spending twenty dollors on both Jack and him. So, we went to target and the vacuum ended up being fourty dollors. I got it for him anyways and told him that he would have to make up for it with my present.. and i was serious. When i was looking for my present, i couldmn't think of anything i wanted except for clothes.. when i told him, he just said that we would get them the next day. The next day.. Father's day.. we went golfing and then out to lunch. He than said after lunch that he wanted to go the next day because he was to tired. So when i called him the next day he told me that he had to work and that he would just try to get my a gift certificate. I am so f***en pissed off at him because i know that he's never going to give me anything and i just waiste fourty dollors on him. So now i decided i won't talk to him anymore for along time!....
