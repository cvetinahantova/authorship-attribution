Rich and I finally got a chance to take in a movie last Saturday. We saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It's a little dull to watch a movie like that when you know from the start that this scary dog chasing Harry is really his beloved godfather just trying to clear his name. I think it was better than the other movies, but it was a little lacking in exposition at the end. If I hadn't read the book, I would have left it more confused that I should have. I want to see the Stepford Wives, but I don't think we'll be getting to another movie any time soon. We're just in TiVo country now! That's how we watch T3-- Which was incidentally a setup for T4.. However how were they to know that Arnold was to become governor of California and hence not available for Terminator movies. I'm sure the franchise will continue.  When we went to see Harry Potter, Sarah watched Eric for us for 3 hours. She was SO tired chasing after the two of them. We came back to her house and she and Zaida were sacked out on her bed with Eric between them bopping around. He of course fell asleep in the car on the way home.  I've been so happy at home lately. Eric has gotten genuinely affectionate. He give hugs and snuggles, and big wet sloppy things that I think he thinks are kisses. But they're completely lovely. I've always considered myself a very loving person, but parenthood has brought out another level of love that I didn't know about. It's like discovering a color that you've never seen before. It's new, complete, profound and overwhelming. I love him so much. It's going to be so hard to watch him discover the world is unfair. But we just have to teach him that he's strong and that he can handle it. Part of the reason it's so important to me to work, is to that we will have the money to pay for private school if we need to.   Yesterday we were playing and he almost pulled my nose off my face.   It was cool.
