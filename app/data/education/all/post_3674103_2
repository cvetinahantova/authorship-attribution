it's that time again. i'm currently in the middle of writing evaluations for my MANY students (somewhere over one hundred). i really don't mind writing them that much. i mean, i enjoy giving those horrible kids bad marks. it's just so satisfying. i'm more annoyed at the way they must be done. this time around, the school decided that actually writing on the paper was not the way to go. instead, we were told that we would have to type out our comments, print them, and glue them onto the paper. what the hell is that all about? i'd also like to see if the korean teachers will be doing the same. somehow, i doubt it.
