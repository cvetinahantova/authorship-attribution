Hello,  My home's in the process of being repaired.  It's been getting me up early.  Boy am I tired.  LOL.  I just need to get my bearings.  I'm also hoping to get myself working on some new theories.  I wrote them down, and we'll see what I can work with in the future.    They're cleaning the carpet at work today.  It's slippery.  I hope not to fall down.  I'll stay in one spot.  LOL  That's it.  One spot.
