how come it's so hard for me to understand everybody else?  i used to be so good at reading people and thinking how they thought.  now i just read people completely wrong and i don't know why.  i'm really frustrated.  the person that i've shared the most with still doesn't understand me.  he's the first person i've actually tried super hard to communicate with and i just get shut out and argued with.  i don't understand.  i don't think i'm being irrational...i'm not mad or feeling bad...and i'm certainly not looking for someone to attach some meaning to why i'm supposedly feeling bad.  i simply wanted to talk about our friendship and try to clarify a few things so that our friendship doesn't get destroyed.  obviously he doesn't think there's a problem and doesn't want to try and have closure.  i give up.  i tried.  it's people like this that make me never want to share my feelings or thoughts with anyone again.  dammit, why am i so emotional lately?  this has been going on for almost a year now...there are times i can't even have a normal conversation without crying...even when it's not even involving anything that i would ever cry about.  maybe there's something wrong with me...like a tear-duct problem...do those exist?  i don't know.  i'm getting better...i think.  anyway, i've decided that i don't need to find anyone.  i'm perfectly fine being alone.  of course, if someone comes along, i won't ignore it.  the thing is that i'm independent.  i've always been independent, and guys don't like that.  what i really need is just a companion to go through life with.  someone i can talk with and go places with.  someone to keep company.  someone that cares about me.  someone who wants to spend time with me...
