Sometimes I crawl into bed and wonder if I'll ever have that amazing feeling of comfort again.  You know the one.  The one where someone you love has his arms wrapped around you, holding you, like they never want to let you go.  That feeling of safety, comfort, love.  The feeling that know matter what else happens life is good just because of this one, wonderful person.  Often I just lay there and pretend.  Pretend he's in the next room and that any minute now he will come crawl into bed and hold me.  Sometimes I just wish I could change something in my past or present to make that happen.  Other times I lay down and I can't pretend.  I can't bear the thought of it all.  So I put on a movie to distract me until I fall into blissfully unaware sleep.  Sometimes I just can't face the night. That's a hard thing for me because I love night time.  I love the darkness.  I love the stars.  I love the subtle beauty.  Daylight brings harsh reality.  Night hides it all in a delicate light.  My favorite is an evening rain storm.  When I was young I use to sneak out of the house during those night time rains and dance under the stars in our back yard.  It had a special meaning to me.  Something... indescribable.
