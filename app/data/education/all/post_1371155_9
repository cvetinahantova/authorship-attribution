The Kuwaiti government in all its wisdom has banned  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  for exposing links between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens. All the evidence that Moore presents and more has been catalogued in Craig Unger's House of Bush, House of Saud and Putu recommends  urlLink this review  by Martin Jacques in the  urlLink Guardian .
