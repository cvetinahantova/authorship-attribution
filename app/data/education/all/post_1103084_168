i've been obsessed with flying for a good deal of my life.  i celebrate airplane takeoffs, drooling out the window, bowled over by the hubris of the whole exercise.  i dream fly frequently.  i've recently told Jaelyn and Addison the story of Icarus and they're intrigued too.  Tell it again, daddy!  (Are there negative consequences to telling your children incessant stories about mythical figures plunging down from the sky to a messy death in the ocean? )  In any case --  urlLink this site  made me glad.  More people should spend their time in productive ventures like this one.
