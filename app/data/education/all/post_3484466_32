'nother typical school day... nothing interesting, really, except science, because we're doing some last-minute physics, which has always been my favorite science. So, that's a bit more entertaining. Anyway, I've got 4 finals... yesterday I thought I only had 2, but no. Health, Math, French, Science in that order. French hardly counts, because it's so easy. Anyway, yeah.  Well, I've got to finish my Utopia project, so I'll be off now.  Current Music: The Mars Volta - Cicatriz ESP
