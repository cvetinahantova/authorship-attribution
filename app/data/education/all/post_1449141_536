HEATHER BOUSHEY, hboushey@cepr.net, http://www.cepr.net An economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Boushey said today: "Compare the current job-loss recovery to the job-less recovery of the early 1990s, and you'll find that in the first 25 months of the recovery of the early 1990s, the economy gained 1,681,000 jobs. Now, 25 months since the 2001 recession ended, the economy has lost 776,000 jobs and wages are actually falling, in spite of booming productivity growth.... This week, the administration has acknowledged that their policies over the past three years have not met their own projections for job growth [which] had assumed that the economy would add about 300,000 jobs per month. Although economic growth picked up last year, as did productivity, 2003 ended with fewer jobs than it had when it began, and over the past four months we've added an average of only 75,000 jobs per month. President Bush said that he would provide more funds for job training.... However, over the past three years, he has proposed at least $1 billion in cuts to job training and vocational programs."
