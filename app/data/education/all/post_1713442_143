urlLink What is Information Literacy? And why should I care?  This is a web site for school (k-12) age students explaining information literacy and why it is important. I like the general approach and how it attempts to make information literacy appear to be relevant.  From the site:  "School research is a training ground for real life. Information literacy skills are skills you will need through your life. We are always seeking information. What car or stereo should I buy? Which college should I choose? Which book should I read next? How can I sell this idea to my boss? How can I convince the school board to act on my proposal? Information helps us reach conclusions, make our choices, and communicate more effectively. But the good stuff is often buried in heaps of junk. We need to continue to improve our searching, evaluating and communication skills in a changing information environment."
