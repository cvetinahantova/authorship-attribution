Well, I got up at 9:30.... god knows when I fell asleep. I think I was waiting for something to install, and it bored the hell out of me, so I collapsed and forgot to get back up... heh...  Yeah, anyway, I guess I'll just go do something. I'll check back later, I'm sure.    Current Music: Royksopp - Remind Me
