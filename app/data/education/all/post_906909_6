As an avid blogger, with an active personal  urlLink blog  being kicked about for a couple of years or so, this platform seemed ideal for the record keeping of my study journal as I amble through the programs I'm taking with  urlLink USQ .   I'm also inspired by the other blogs of fellow study mates and hope that this journal will be up to mark!   For this semester, I'm taking on two subjects, FET5601: Instructional Design for Flexible Learning and FET8601: Teaching Online: Strategies and Tactics. With this being my first semester in the program, I am looking forward to the learning experience and sharing in the wealth of experience and knowledge that every one in the class contributes to.
