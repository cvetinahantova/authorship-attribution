This is by far the hardest part of keeping a blog over here, writing when there is really not a whole lot to write about.  I did have a somewhat eventful day by middle Georgia standards.  I had to go to Macon, which is about 20 min North.  I went and got my international drivers license and I signed up to take the GRE on Monday.  Well the international drivers license thing was cake.  All you needed were to passport size photos and $10 and you're good to go.  You have to fill out a really short form and that's all.  I was expecting some kind of test or a lot of paper work or something but as it turned out I walked in and walked out.  It is only good for a year but hell for $10 who cares.  I really don't have anything to drive but I am thinking of getting something if I can find it cheap.  I think it might come in handy sometimes.  Not so much for when I go out b/c I usually get pretty drunk but for getting around and stuff it might not be bad.  No feed back on the white pants so I guess I'll bring them.  Scott mailed me today and said he has gotten all the paper work and will mail it to me tomorrow.  That is about all I'm waiting on.  Once I get that it's a quick run to get the visa and then I jump on the plane.  Seems to easy, something has to go wrong between now and then.  I'm tired, it's pretty late over here.  Here are the answers to the questions in case anyone cared.  I'll post more questions later.   1) Richard III 2) Denton, he was nicknamed Cy- for Cyclone- b/c of his fastball 3) the seed, the big red thing we eat is called the bulb. 4) Winston- after Winston Churchill 5) Pride (in the name of love)
