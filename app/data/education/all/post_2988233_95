HOw is my day after Easter???? I have been on the phone or waiting for the phone to ring all morning.  Trying to get Casey in with the Orthopidic doctor.  Evidently there has been a ruch of broken bones and our normal doc is all booked up.    So I am waiting for another doc to call now.  Pateintly, patiently waiting.   (singing now)dummm dee dumm dee dummmmmmm, waiting for the phone to ring, the phone to ring, the phone to ring......  ALl in the house are asleep.  Quiet is good.  Very good.    Tommy is off today for Easter.  I was really glad to here that.  In all the commotion, we didn't get any laundry done yesterday, and at 1am, I realized Tommy had no clothes for work done.  I thanked him so much when he told me he was off.  lol.  Silly I know, but I didn't want to be making a trip to mom and dad's at 6:30am to do laundry.  I wanted to sleep in.    Still haven't done the laundry.  Waiting for the phone to ring.  That is my mantra today, Waiting for the phone to ring.
