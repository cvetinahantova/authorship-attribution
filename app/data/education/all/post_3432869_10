Instead of going to Chicago to the Q&A session for Japan, Tony and I decided to attend Ron and Angie’s wedding in its entirety.    As the time drew near, my anxiety about going to Japan decreased, thanks to my predecessor Kirsty, and I was beginning to feel that the time with my family would be more valuable.  Besides that, the 3 hour drive to Chicago and then the 5 hour drive to Sheboygan afterwards would have been extremely taxing.  The drive to Sheboygan was a little stressful.  Last minute, Tony discovered that he had nothing to wear.  Until I went shopping with him last weekend, I didn’t understand how difficult it was to find clothing and shoes that fit him.  Poor thing.  That’s one thing we both look forward to in Japan.  We should be able to find everything that we need in our size!  We spent some pretty stressful moments at Johnson Creek Outlet stores before just buying a belt and leaving it at that.    We made it to the church with about 10 minutes to spare.  The whole family from mom’s side was there.  It was kind of hard because we had to sit down right away and I didn’t have time to introduce Tony to everyone.   It was a fairly small and simple wedding; very nice actually.  Everyone had a really good time and surprising enough, Crazy Aunt Mary was rather controlled.  The highlight of the evening had to be watching grandma do the chicken dance and the YMCA.  What a great time!
