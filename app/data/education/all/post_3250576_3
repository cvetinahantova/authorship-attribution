So, I'm getting married in 27 days.  Since it's on my mind, the impending marriage often comes up in conversations.  Lately, I've noticed that instead of saying congrats or asking me if I'm excited, the majority of people I talk to ask me if I'm nervous or scared.  I get told I'm so brave for getting married considering the divorce rate.  In general, people seem to be of the opinion that marriage is something that I have to do rather than something that I want to do.  Where is this coming from?  Did I miss the memo about being afraid of marriage?  There is certainly no box to check on my wedding checklist that tells me when to get cold feet.  It's not even so much that I don't understand why people are skeptical of marriage, but rather that they would impose their skepticism onto me.  Isn't it simply more polite to say congrats instead of "are you scared?"  Make no mistake.  Marriage is not something I'm being forced into.  I don't feel like I have to do it to satisfy social norms, my parents, or anyone else.  This marriage is not about taxes or legal issues.  It's not because I want to wear a white dress and eat cake.  I want to get married.  I am excited to take part in a ceremony that will declare my love for my future husband.  Nothing major will change in our lives after the ceremony, we already live together as husband and wife and I view Ted as my family.  But seriously, why this sudden fear of, and even disdain for marriage?  It's everywhere!  I'm no traditionalist by any means, and I certainly respect a person's right not to get married.  Is it too much to ask that you respect my right to marry?
