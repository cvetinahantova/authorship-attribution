Last semester, we were doing a proposal paper for Prof.Kay course.... she did mentioned about primary and secondary sources.According to Prof.Kay, primary source is more reliable than a secondary source because it has the advantage of being a firsthand account.          In carrying out the task given either in position or research paper, I have to read with a 'critical eye'.I have to examine the assumptions, assessing its evidence and weighing its conclusions.          Ssometimes I came across some elements of argument and encounter experts who disagree with the sources I found. Here I have to read the sources arguments with special care and testing them with my own critical intelligence....now my note taking skills came in. In order to make life easier, I have to take notes as I read because it will help me to remember later as I am going to draft my position as well as my research paper.....
