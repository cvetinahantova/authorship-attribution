On Friday night I had the fun task of trying to sort out the mess our wild shower had created. Yep, the water pressure caused it to veer wildly out of control, flooding the bathroom and soaking the ceiling of my neighbours who live below my flat.  Naturally, he was not best pleased...and neither when I when insurance figures started floating before my eyes.  Luckily it all ended well the next day when I went down to speak to him; he's going to fix the damage himself.  But what a pain that was! Going home for an evening tomorrow to have a few last-minute bridesmaid stuff done.
