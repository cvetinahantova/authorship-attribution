Ok, all that actually read my posts...... We (as in me and Shane at the moment) are planning to gather up everybody, steal them away, and take them to the magical Wild Waters. That's right W.W. So if you still got your tix from when they gave us all refunds then throw together a beach bag and head on over. Even if you don't have a ticket then you get to wait and pay full price or use your season pass. We want you there anyway. We aren't sure when but we'll figure out a time and date soon.   For more info on this or if you just want to talk then email me or call me. If you don't have my number then email me and I can give you my number.
