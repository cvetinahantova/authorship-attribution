Well, here I am in the computer lab, getting a jump start on a week's worth of homework. I wish I had a life.  I've decided to hold off on finalizing topics for a couple of classes until we have an actual class, not just the "here's the syllabus, and by the way, you're doing a final project that'll turn your brain to oatmeal" session. But I've got options at this point, which is good. I chose an oral interp project, since we're supposed to bring something to read in front of the class tomorrow. I decided on the lyrics to  Ana Ng  by  urlLink They Might Be Giants . A lot of their works are real poetry. Plus, I fell in love with the line "When I was driving once, I saw this painted on a bridge/ "I don't want the world, I just want your half." the first time I heard it.  And I think I'm going to do my semester-long study for Play Production on Tennessee William's  The Glass Menagerie . I'm more than familiar with the show and the set and prop requirements, so that should help a lot. And for my stage management credit, I think I'm going to ask this girl Lindsey if I can stage manage her show,  The Boys Next Door , which she's directing for her senior project. She seemed rather excited at the prospect of having a stage manager handle all the logistics so she can concentrate on directing.  I get the feeling that most of my tech tine this week is going to be spent rearranging and reorganizing the workshop and costume shop. ::sigh:: I want something to paint! :) And perhaps this will be the year I finally learn to use a drill!
