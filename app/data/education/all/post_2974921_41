gosh, everything's too good to be true!  my folks finally approved of jammi calling me at home but mama's still gonna talk to my uncle.   jammi and i talked over the phone yesterday for more than an hour. i had fun! we talked a lot and found something nice about each other. at the end of our conversation, i aid someting i really meant. "“I love you…..and for the first time, I really mean it. Before I didn’t when I said it. It was like, you like me, okay, I love you. But now, it’s different. I do love you, Jammi…” god, i mean it....  i just found out why my life sucks. it's because i live up to everyone's expectations i can't live up to my own. i'm too used to doing what everyone tells me that i forget what my own wants are. i realized that last year, when i found out someone hates me, i do everything i can to make them love me. now that was whacked! jammi and i had a talk about it. he said i should try using this motto:"the world fucks you, fuck the world." nice one, i'll take it then.   finally, my bro and i are talking now. just a little at a time but, hey, that's improvement...
