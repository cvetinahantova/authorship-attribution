You can hear songs from the new  urlLink PJ Harvey  album  urlLink here . The album as a whole is much harder than her last (which was fucking brilliant). It's a bit too much for me, but I do like "No Child Of Mine" (a wee song), "The Darker Days Of Me And Him," "Shame" and (the single) "The Letter."   PS: The first song isn't bad either .
