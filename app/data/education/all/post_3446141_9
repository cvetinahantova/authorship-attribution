Ok so Comcast had a planned on coming to hookup our cable at the house between the hours of 2 and 5pm......sounds easy right?  Well apparently not.  5 rolls around, still no cable.  So Tyler makes a phone call and they say "oh right, uhhhh, he will be there by 5:30 sorry for the inconvenience."  So I get home from work around 5:00, hang around waiting for the cable guy........yet again a no show at 5:30.  So Tyler makes another phone call and the cable people say "oh erm, well he will be there by 6:45.  So anyway at this point my friend Beth has already come by the house and is hanging out will I get ready for us to go out for a girls night.  We finally decided our plans, dinner then Willy D's (if there wasn't a cover) and left at 7ish.  Still no cable guy at this point.  We leave Tyler there to fend for himself with the cable situation.  Well finally around 8:15 I get a call on my cell phone, Tyler needing to get Aliciaâ€™s password to make sure the internet is working on her computer.  LOL.  Talk about late service.  Anyway, I just think that there should be some way for the Cable Company to be just a little bit more organized!  That is all.
