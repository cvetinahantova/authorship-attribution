so it wasn't as bad as i thought! we actually had fun. we had steak for dinner, it was soo good. then we went to the show, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. it was a cute show (with cute boys). they tried to force us to watch it in class last year and i rebelled. haha i never follow directions.. Sheila came with me so i wouldn't get bored and i learned my daddy doesn't love me! totally ignored me.. talked to sheila.. oh well. i always liked the mail man more then him anyway..   so yeah.. there's really nothing else to talk about!
