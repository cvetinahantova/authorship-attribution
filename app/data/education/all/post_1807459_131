Ok so Saipan is basically tropical paradise.  It is everything and more that Caleb made it out to be.  I'm way too tired to go into detail about we'll say it was a good trip.  Definitely too short but a good trip.  I'm currently sitting my ass in the airport as I wait for the atms to start working so I can get some money to buy a bus ticket to go the hell home.  I think I'll actually try and work today just so I don't have to go in on Sunday.  The atms here are stupid.  I really hate them.  If the worked at, say 7 o'clock, Mr. Papp and myself could have been on our way home.  I reality we are only getting set back a little over and hour so it isn't a big deal but it's the principle of the matter.  Why don't they work?  And why isn't there a sign explaining it?  Jeez, sometimes Korea baffles me.  I also need to go to Immigration.  I was supposed to go on Friday with Scott but as you can guess that feel apart somehow.  The funny thing is that my visa runs out tomorrow and if I don't go I'm going to be in some hot water.  I think really all I have to do is pay a fine but still that ain't cool.  Ok I think this is about all for now.  I'll recount the past weekend and the trip to Saipan another time.  Despite that this PC room is a bit expensive it is still a great idea to kill time in the airport.
