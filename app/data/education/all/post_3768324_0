I think when the school year actually begins in about three, four weeks I'm going to move this blog into a daily summary and analysis of teaching in an urban Texas ghetto. It might shape the direction of "Donna Martin Graduates."  As for the DNC, a collection of thoughts:    When my first child is in Kindegarten, his social studies curriculum will be highlighted by President Barack Obama.   Was Kerry's speech really that rushed?   Being a delegate in 2008 would be cool.   I thought the unity and the speeches were all very good, but hey... isn't it the same political rhetoric I heard in 1992, 1996, and 2000? Do these speeches ever result in change?   Why is it that all politicians try to shape their lives as common and meaningful to the average man, yet they're well-connected millionaires in reality?   Wouldn't you love to see a dude who drove to Boston in a dusty pickup truck win the nomination?   Does the GOP have an advantage by going second, and closer to Election Day?    Seriously, this is what I don't understand. Bear in mind, this argument is going to make me sound stupid, and not credible to discuss said topics. If you watch CNN and see a set piece where a Republician and a Democrat are interviewed about the same issue, HONESTLY they say slight variations of the same general theme. If everyone wants America to succeed, why can't bipartanship flourish in various governmental organizations? Why can't anyone say "fuck the sides of the aisle, I want America to succeed" and then actually mean it?  Ah, I'm naive...
