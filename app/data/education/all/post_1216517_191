I'VE ARRIVED yes.  i am here.  in antigua guatemala.  i spend the night in atlanta because the flight was oversold.  i got to eat dinner with a bunch of high schoolers traveling to spain.  their flight was oversold too.  one kid showed me a list of his 200 favorite cartoons.  i told him that homestar runner needed to be on there.  he had no idea about the site.  kids.  the airline gave me a 400 dollar flight voucher so i have my next trip in the works (ireland, thailand?)  I had a wonderful introduction to the country.  In line waiting for customs i met a guatemalan couple, luis and ruth.  They were the most hospitable people ive ever met.  they offered to show me the bus from guatemala city to antigua.  then told me that they would drive me there.  its an hour away.  they wouldnt let me refuse.  so we loaded up with the couple their nephew and luis brother.  it was hilarious.  at the airport, they were met by what seemed like dozens of their relatives. they just kept showing up, crawling out of the woodwork.  it was like they knew everybody in the city.  they waved to people on the road as we were driving to antigua.  they introduced me as their adopted son, darren.  classic.  ive only been in guatemala about 3 hours, but i love it.  i met a couple of irish guys, andy and martin who were blasting u2 achtung baby back at the hostel.   antigua is pretty dope.  it used to be the colonial capital of central america (side note: justin timberlake is bumping it here at the internet cafe) all the buildings here are really old.  there are a lot of travelers here as well.  they have a few language schools here.  i almost feel like an old man with all these youngsters running around.  well, im going to head to the donna luisa (our friend william jefferson clinton who is in the news so much nowadays visited there on a trip to guatamala as president) for some local grub if i can find it.  nothing is marked here (street signs, names, addresses..)  peace.  check my blog, iï¿½ll try and give more updates as the trip progresses.
