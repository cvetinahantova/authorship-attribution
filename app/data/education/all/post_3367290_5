No we are not miles apart, But i cannot heal my withered heart.  These pains i feel, Not yet realizing that this is so real.  These pains in my heart,  As we fell so far apart.  The roses i gave so little and few, But every rose there has been  has said I love you.  You made me feel like a peice of gold, A peice of gold everyone wanted to hold.  My feelings for you will always be, But always knowing we will never see.  When you left me that day I died within, Not knowing that you could never love me again.  The things i said might have never been clear, Witch would release my worst fear.  For moving on is going to be hard, But ounce again my life will go on.
