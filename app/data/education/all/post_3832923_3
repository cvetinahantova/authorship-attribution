So I mentioned briefly in my first entry that I've kept journals since I was 14 years old, right? Well, as I was cleaning out my sorry excuse for a bedroom two days ago I came across like five of my old journals and since I didn't really feel like cleaning to begin with, I had a sit and flipped through them.  After reading outrageous entry after hilarious entry (cue laughter), I started thinking about my years of journalling and am now able to articulate that thought that snuck into my head at that moment.  Question: Am I still the Hope of 14 year old Hope or am I someone completely new and revised from the older version? I mean, I detect a resemblance to that girl from before. I remember what I did and what I thought (thanks to dear old Diary), but am I really the same person? I tend to think not. Just because life continues day after day and I see the slow progression from me being me then to me now, I still can't say that who I am at 27 has much to do with who I was at 14. I'm not better. I'm older and I think differently, but not better.  I used to believe that experience was everything and from experience man grew and transformed and became substance, but I won't go that far anymore. I'll say my life has taught me things and given me memories, but that's not synonymous with becoming someone new. Hell, I don't know.  That's the point of this column. That's the point of this blog. I don't know. Show's over folks, the wizard has been revealed as the little man behind the curtain and here I am left wondering what to do next.   Oh. I know. I'll write another entry on this very topic only I'm tweak it to make it look like something else. Cue smoke and mirrors.
