today..teacher's day!no EXAM!nothing much..just celebration..but without me as one of the people-in-charge..  surfed the web..found some information abt engineering courses in UK.. submitted the application form...hahaha..guess what..i submitted for courses tht will be started during winter 2005...what a rush..just imagine..a year after SPM dah fly..really-really cool..but i'm not depending 100% on tht application..just wanna see if i'm lucky or not..and tht's not part of my masterplan..i hv my own goals to achive and i don't wait for it..as the france proverb says "je ne cherche pas, je trouve" (i do not seek,i find) and tht's wht i'm gonna do... BUT if i'm lucky, given the opportunity, i'll grab it..not stupid enough to let it go..  t'morrow..physics paper..i don't hv any target yet..maybe b'coz i hvn't prepared yet..but it's the part of the plan..i wanna see my true ability..just face the exam without any preparation..i hv to sacrifice my mid year exam because this is the first time sitting for the real examination format question papers..sorry mum, dad, princess and teachers...maybe i'll let u all a bit down this time..but as i said before..it's a part of my plan..nevermind..after this, i'll be extremely serious for my trial exam..and straight As is my target..that's my promise
