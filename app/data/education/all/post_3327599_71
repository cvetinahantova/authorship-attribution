AWWW HOW CUTE!! i'm a little ummm hyper... and sometimes I freeze the pills and it's like eating a bunch of ice cream. so I put all the pills in a giant carton, and i put a little bit of milk, and then... and then i wait a couple hours, i take it out of the freezer, and then i get a spoon and then i just start eating it. er.. some of the side effects to the medication i take are either nightmares, and sometimes diseases, and sometimes diarrhea, constipation, bleeding from the eyes... my ears ache... sometimes, i get headaches, migraines... death... but i got pills to cure the death, so i take those and it... and it off-sets the death effects.  and NOW you're thinking "omg she pops pills".. but.. but.. why would you say that i "pop" them? i don't pop the pills, i take them and i eat them. i put them in my mouth and i swallow them and then they stay in my tummy and go turn colors and make them go larger, and then all of a sudden my diseases are cured for a short time until I have to take more pills...  now for some seriousness.. yeah.. me.. serious.. whatever! anyway! those were lines from my lord and master Foamy.. actually from his friend Pillz-e whom i love and is my hero!! www.illwillpress.com you will not be sad you went.. and if you don't laugh.. you are a freak and i don't want to talk to you ever again.. jk i will still love you even though you are weird! chances are.. i already know you are weird..
