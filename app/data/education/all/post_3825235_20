Just so you know who the girls are that you are reading about.  Abbie-Dabbie and her moma..yeah!Â  urlLink     urlLink     This was taken around christmas-time, and NO, it is not a copyrighted picture.  We did not go to a photographer...we set up camp right there in my MomMaw's Living Room.  There, we took pictures of the cousins on my mom's side of the family.  (Meanwhile, the reunion last weekend was for my dad's side of the family.  All clear, now!)  So, there you have it, our family picture...isn't it great???
