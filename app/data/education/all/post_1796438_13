Movie Day  This Tuesday was movie day. The two options were either School of Rock or Looney Tunes. In the morning it was pretty much average. Hera was absent, leading to speculation that she only attends school for the work. The siren went and everyone headed off to the form rooms. Period 1 saw the group slitting off into the smaller groups: those in the English room, those in the  and those who wern't. In the English room was myself, along with Morgan, Tonya, Kyla, Mandy, Teagan... (I think that's everyone. Forgive me if I'm wrong). well, everyone else. In the English room we were working on the laptops trying to organise the class poetry book, "Cicadas in a Pond". The work was very hectic, and demanded a stop for lunch before everyone else had theirs. Morgan and Lily walked down to the shop to get fish and chips, but unfortunately it was closed. The came back with chips, and we managed to have a decent meal anyway (after hiding the poster that said "No Eating In Room 3 Or Else". We got lots done on the poetry book, including ordering it and everything. Trust me, this was a big breakthrough for us.  Meanwhile other talents were being put to use in the Art room between recess and lunch. Hawkins, Cartledge and Jordan were in there finishing their respective portraits. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, there were no large scale paint wars. However Jordan did miscalculate the amount of paint neededfor his painting and ended up with a result that could be improved. Both of the Brad's however came to the decision that their pieces of art were perfect. Everyone else spent their time wandering around... talking, sitting, avoiding the possibility of playing sport and other everyday tasks.  After lunch we traversed over to Fenwick 3 Cinemas. We lined up in 2 lnes, one for each movie. The School of Rock line stretched at least twice as long as the Looney Tunes line. In cinema 2 (L.T.) was myself, Cartledge, Hawkins, Jordan, Cody and Mandy. In cinema 1 (S.o.R.) was the remainder of the group going to the movies. As Looney Tunes was shorter than School of Rock by approximately half an hour we were able to watch the beginning of another Lonney Tunes cartoon, but the sound was horrendous, and it would've been better just to sit and talk. After the movies everyone was forced to return to the school via the busses, and then we went home.   Assembly  Lots of people got prizes at the assembly on Wednesday. Here's a list of winner of the prizes: Art            :   Lily Business  :   Hayden Computer :   Jordan Drama      :   Morgan                 :   Tonya   English     :   Hayden French      :   Lily Japanese :   Hawkins Horse       :   Mandy Media       :   Morgan S & E        :   Morgan  Challenge Bank endeavor award : Lily  Remember, those are only the prizes.

She is moving up to Perth, but she is still as much of a member of the Loud Crowd as anyone else. We hope to be hearing from her via this website in the near future. That way she can read up on our news and we can read up on hers. If you want to contact her then email her at coyote_ugly14788@hotmail.com and say hello.   Site Update  Tonya and Morgan now have posting abilities. We hope to hear interesting tales from them soon...
