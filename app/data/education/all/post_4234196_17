It is the night before our first day in a classroom.  Tomorrow, we will be meeting with our cooperating teachers in their schools to attend meetings with them and begin helping them set up their classrooms.  I am excited and a little bit nervous.  I have not been able to contact my cooperating teacher yet, so I will be meeting him tomorrow morning for the first time.  Had to attend to a family birthday party, so I put on my new "Teacher Shoes" to wear for the day, just to get used to them.  They seem to be pretty comfortable.  I will be getting to bed at around 10:00 p.m., hoping to get up at 6:00 a.m. to get ready.  I already have my clothes picked out and everything.  (Aren't I cute?)  Unfortunately, on only my second day of posting, I have already hurt the feelings of someone in our cohort that I care very much about.  I have apologized and amended my commentary.  The things that I meant did not come out as well as I wanted them to and I am sorry.  Best of luck to everyone!  Paul
