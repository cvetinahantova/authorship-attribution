I am at home in the afternoon again! Makes me so mad. Today my pain was very bad, so I taught my lessons at work and then came home at lunchtime. I had no lessons this afternoon, and I will go to work as normal tomorrow, but I will not over-exert myself. Well, my return to work hasn't been all that bad, you know. Apart from the incident of the vile student with a vendetta against me (which I feel has set my recovery back a little as I was beginning to be on the mend), I've quite enjoyed a lot of it. My lower set year 10s and my year 9s were, ugh, soul-destroying, but the rest has been ok. VM, in my tutor group, has even asked me to bring back my rat story book, so she can read it herself. This is such a big thing for her: she is so painfully shy it's without a doubt the most she's ever said to me in the 2 years I've been her teacher. It surely makes the heart swell! The one sad thing is that the news of my imminent departure is slowly seeping around the school. Two of my favourite pupils overheard the receptionists talking about it and boy; are these girls not happy with me! They are devestated. Another year 8 girl asked me about it today. I'm not sure quite what to do now. I didn't really want to break it to anyone before I went. Oh well. I'm going to go and have a bath now.
