after not watching TV regularly for so long i'm halfway kicking myself for being hooked on 3 shows... but they're fun so i can't get too mad at myself. =P  tired because i stayed up and watched what i had recorded of friends and the apprentice until 2am last night instead of getting even close to 8 hours of sleep... but i *had* to see who got fired!  i'm starting to hope troy wins.  today's another turn in homework day in algebra... i ran the first two times... we'll see if i stay in the room this time or not.  blah.  happy almost weekend at least. =P
