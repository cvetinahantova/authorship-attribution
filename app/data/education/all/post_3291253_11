Hell...  I have never felt comfortable enough with anyone to really tell the first sexual experience I've ever had, so I have a bit of a problem with first times. Some people may even say that I don't give a good first impression, but as they get to know me, in time, they change their minds about me. I find that hard to believe, I think they actually confirm that I am a pompous ass and just realize that I am rather harmless and decide they can actually get by without giving a damn about me.  So without further ado I give you what hopefully will be endless pointless observations on my life and pretty much a complete waste of time.
