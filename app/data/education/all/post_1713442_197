urlLink ACRL - Internet Education Project  This project is highlighting good instructional resources that teach students to use the Web.  It includes a databse of these materials as well a site of the month archive.  From the site:  "The Internet Education Project (IEP) is a means to promote and share peer reviewed instructional materials created by librarians to teach people about discovering, accessing and evaluating information in networked environments. The Committee hopes that publicizing selective, high quality resources will help librarians to respond to the educational challenges posed by still emerging digital technologies."
