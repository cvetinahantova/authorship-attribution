Hi!  It is Friday at lunchtime.  I have asked my cooperating teacher and my principal for the afternoon off, so that I can chase down my registration problems at CSU and get everything straightened away.    After much legwork, I found out my problem.  I am not admitted into the Graduate School yet.  This is putting a hold on my registration.  I talked with Randi Fuller and there are still two pieces of paper that I am missing from my folder.  I have them and will be taking them to her this afternoon.  I am hoping that with some luck and alot of running around, I can get the admission approved this afternoon and complete registration.  She is out to lunch at the moment, but I will check in with her afterwards.  I will need to get her approval, the approval of Donna (?) the head of the Ed. Grad. School, then get the information to Admissions, so that they can release my hold, allowing me to register at The Registrar's office.  Of course, I will be unable to get registered for all classes, as I need an overload form, taking 23 credits instead of the normal 15 as a Graduate Student.  This means I will have to get the signature of the Dean of the Graduate School on my Overload form, then take the form back to the Registrar for completion of my registration.  Think I can get all of that done today?  I doubt it.  If I can at least get the Admissions stuff completed today, I think that I will be alright, because I can do late registration if absolutely necessary.  Everyone is getting together this evening at Kylie's house for a check-in with our cohort.  My wife will be working and I will have the kids, so I don't know if I will make it...  Anyway, I need to get going.  Bye!
