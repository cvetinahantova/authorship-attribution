The wind just picked up and now they've just changed Mom and Rod's evacuation alert to an evacuation order.  1050 families are now packing up and getting out. Two families are coming to my house. Wow. Scary stuff. The helicopters and fire engines are going crazy.    Mom and Rod stayed overnight with us last night because they didn't want to be evacuated in the middle of the night. Today they went back home and spent the afternoon packing up more stuff as the fires get closer.  Mom called me a little while ago to tell that the helicopters were bucketing directly over her house.  She said it felt like M*A*S*H.    I have been watching the TV news, listening the the radio, and watching the Castanet website all day long.  I can't stop. I heard the evacuation order come through and called mom to tell her.  Also called another family who had asked if they could stay with us in the event they were evacuated.  Neither of them had even heard.  More later.
