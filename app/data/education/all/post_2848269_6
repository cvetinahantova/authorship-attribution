So, my dad gave me his N64. I was supposed to get Perfect Dark with it too, but that's no where to be found. Oh well, I have DUKE NUKEM 64, YEAH! Just wait until I get Goldeneye 007. I own at Turok 2 as well.   Eventually my brothers will be too afraid to play with me. Muah.  That is the end of that though. Post more later.
