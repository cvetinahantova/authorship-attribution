THE MAN AUCTION!      Because I wasn`t nearly tired enough after my party on Friday night, Saturday night had to be an equally festive and exhausting one.  In Miyagi there are two different groups of Jets doing Habitat for Humanity projects over Golden Week in May.  Well, the group going to Sri Lanka (the other one is going to Bangladesh) decided to have a ladies night and auction off some of Miyagi`s finest.  Our first challenge was getting there.    Due to the excitement of the previous night, I along with a couple of friends did not want to spend the night at the location of this event.  The problem was that the last bus to return was at 7:30 and that is the same time the event started.  While we initially believed we had no alternative, we eventually realized that not only would renting a car enable us to return home and sleep in our own beds, it would also end up costing less than taking the train, subway, and bus to get there.  I got to drive again!!!    The auction was a huge success and the habitat group raised over 6 man (60,000 yen or roughly $600 US).  All of us knew what package we were bidding on but not the man who was offering the designated service.  The packages included things such as motorcycle rides and dinner, massages, tennis lessons, and the final package was even a haircut and then photo shoot which enabled you to spend the day with one of the best looking Miyagi Jets.  The night was loads of fun and although I didn`t return home until almost 2:30 AM (I was running a bit of a carpool and therefore had to return everyone to their cities first) it was well worth it!   Lucky me also got to use the car the next day because we had to rent it for 24 hours so Jemma and I had fun doing a little shopping and lunch before I had to give it back.  All in all a very eventful weekend!
