I just wanted to let y'all know that I had a job lined up for this coming school year. I was taking a maternity leave position (full year) for an elementary music teacher in the Portage school system near my house. Unfortunately the teacher carried to term and delivered a still-born infant. The teacher now wants her job abck for this year (understandably). This leaves me displaced for this year.  Fortunately (for me), I have the school superintendant on my side and she has been calling around to the other area schools to try and place me in a permanant job setting. Today I was informed that I have an interview on thursday the 29th of July at 5 pm for a choir director position at Merrillville Schools (Jr. High). Hopefully this will lead to a full time position. Please pray for me with this interview.  I also need to finish a correspondance course and get my Indiana Teaching Certificate in one month. This is going to be a real stretch for me, but I think I can do it. Pray for me as I will be very stressed out trying to get all my papers and tests finished by this time.   I know that God is leading me into something wonderful here. Perhaps because there is a child in this school that needs my guidance. This sounds like a wonderful opportunity and I'm hoping and praying that I get the position.  Signing off.  Current mood: Hopful  Current Music: Third Day
