what's better than just having a cool funny boss who likes me and makes me free lunches? -- getting to swim in her pool after work!  today it got up to 99 with a heat index of 119 in my part of town... craziness... however, at 4pm, when we were done working, we headed outside and swam for 2 hours -- it felt great!  i hadn't had a chance to swim since last year!  done working for the summer... tomorrow's dentist appointment, packing, lunch with mom, and Bible study @ Doc Sohn's before i head back to jersey thurs and fri..  time to be a bum for once... later dudes :-P
