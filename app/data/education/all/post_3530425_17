Last night, I went out with David.  For the second time.  His face keeps showing up on my personals subscription as a "match," and I thought maybe the universe was trying to tell me something.  Our first date was early in the spring, and a subsequent phone conversation kind of freaked me out.  He told me he's psychic, and everything in me went, "Oh no, not again."  The ex made the same claim, and got really weird about it.  I think it's possible to be tuned into your intuition and to recognize signs that less in-tune people don't recognize.  But the ex was just f-ing weird about the whole thing.  I didn't want to go there again.  Awkward at first, a drink got us more relaxed with one another.   While we didn't get too deep, the conversation flowed nicely.  The musicians started, and I sort of leaned into him, just in case the touches on his hand weren't letting him know I was interested.  We held hands, he stroked my knee -- I never knew that could feel so good.  He's a good man -- rock solid.  He is self-assured without being arrogant.  He's an absolute gentleman:  I was hoping, when we got into the elevator to go to my car that he'd wrap his arms around me and make out a little, but he just gave me two gentle kisses good night at the car.  No rush.  So nice.   This one is worth seeing again, without reservation.
