I have been reading blogs for some time now, okay really only a few months in reality.  Since the end of October.  I started reading blogs through accident. I was trying to locate a business in the Houston area and doing a google search sent me  urlLink here .  I have been reading ever since.  Through emily's blog, I began reading others and it has grown into a sort of obsession. I like to read what other's write because I realize that while, yes, my life isn't exactly action city (that would be Vegas right?) I still have a little bit to say on some things.  So this blog is in some ways a thank you to emily, and to  urlLink mice  because I didn't even know  urlLink this site  existed.  Although I don't think they know that they are my "inspirations" if you will.  So be sure to visit their sites for some good reading and interesting perspectives on different topics.  I think I will be able to celebrate my one year anniversary with pride and joy and a feeling of accomplishment even if no one actually reads this.
