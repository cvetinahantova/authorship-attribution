Tommy is watching Jerry Springer.  He is the last person on earth that still enjoys watching that show.  I hate it.  Have hated it from the first time I saw it.    I may be naive, but there is no way that show isn't scripted.  There can't be THAT many perverted people in America.    But he still gets a kick out of watching all the fights.
