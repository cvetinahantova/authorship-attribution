Having got home a bit flustered, I managed to lock my keys in the garage while putting my bike away (no spare key!) but at least I was in the house. Panic set in because of the way I was thinking, following the events at the doctors. The realisation a doctor thought I had depression was just kicking in......and it was depressing! I found myself thinking of needing a hug from my wife, then questioned whether I was only thinking that because I was low and needed a high.  After an hour or so I rang my mother-in-law (my parents are not supportive), explained what I had done with my keys and told her that I had been to the doctors, got a referral and was on anti-depressants. I wasn't sure what her reaction would be (because I felt I now had this huge label "depression" hanging round my neck) but she was very good about it.  My father-in-law came round and managed to break into the garage - either because of a mis-spent youth or because he was able to put his engineering skills to practice (I don't know which!)  Now the only hurdle was how to tell my wife. This actually proved easier in practise than it did when thinking it over. She is a nurse and has strong beliefs about people with depression. She told me to try not to get hung up on it, or use it as an excuse. The discussions that followed, made me realise that my fear was myself and that my problem was treatable.
