I Love Post-Its!!!!!!    Â  Maybe my memory is going insane, but I love Post-its! Yes Yes I admit it, I do love them! I constantly am writing down lists of "things to do" and I KNOW I will forget if I do not write down what needs to be done...and well Post-Its have become my best friend because of this habit! Every day I must go through at least 4 Post-Its on which I write down what I need to do!!! All I know is that these wonderful sticky pieces of papers totally help me get the job done!
