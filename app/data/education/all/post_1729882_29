Reality TV sucks.  It has no basis in reality.  I'll take a good baseball game anyday.  Why can't coaches be fair.  I know some kids are better than others, but to play a kid 1/2 of an inning when others are playing the whole game is not right.  In keeping with the baseball theme -   GO CARDINALS!!     Bush has got to go!  (I'm just not thrilled with Kerry either.)   Motivation and procrastination - a winning combination.  Especially when it comes to diet and exercise.  School starts in 3 weeks - yippee?  Everyone talked about how Steven King's   Dark Tower   series was so good.  I am reading the first book and am not that excited about it.  Should I buy a Palm PDA?  We are taking the boys to the   Brickyard 400   in Indy.  What am I getting myself into?
