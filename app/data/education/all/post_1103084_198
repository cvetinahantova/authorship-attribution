. spirituality .  "According to the Franciscan priest Richard Rohr, spirituality is not for people who are trying to avoid hell; it is for people who have been through hell. In many ways, spirituality is about what we do with our pain. And the truth is, if we don't transform it, we will transmit it." - Al Gustafson   thanks to  urlLink bob .  who i don't know, but appreciate just now.
