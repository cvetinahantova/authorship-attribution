The coming generation of theologians will start out as bloggers, says  urlLink Dan Hughes . They will be "schooled in global-reach pontification, in flame wars and public reconciliation. They will know how it feels to be wrong in a very open way and will be well versed in admitting to it. ... these new theologians will not be content with restating the given truths of a bygone era nor, certainly, the cosmologies, philosophies or economies of power that these language worlds of the past came to dominance within. an explosion of nuanced thinking around the myriad details of existence will be felt as the voices of a million empowered perspectives articulate a new network of worlds no less foreign to us now than our's would be to those who labored in Calvin's Geneva, Muhammad's Medina or Augustine's Hippo."
