I love it when I have dreams in Spanish...   And the wierd thing is, I can speak it fluently in my sleep.   Huh...  Now if I can only learn how to harness this power, I could concievably teach English during the day, and have people come over at night and sit by my bed while I give them Spanish lessons in my sleep!  Whoooaaa... I would be so rich.  I mean, come on, if you could teach in your sleep, you could charge an arm and a leg so that people would have the priviledge of saying, "I'm a student of the Sleeper Teecher"   God, I need to cut back on all the sugar I put on my Frosted Flakes.
