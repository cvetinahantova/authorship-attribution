urlLink Presidents (Eyewitness Books)   This looks like a fun sticker book on American Presidents.  It is by James Barber and John Hareas.  From the Amazon Description:  With this 8-page booklet, young readers can learn fun facts about United States presidents as they fill in background scenes with more than 60 reusable stickers. All 43 presidents are represented in miniature photo or portrait reproductions. In addition, stickers of the presidential seal, campaign posters, pins, and pendants, and American flags can be removed and placed in the scenes, which include the Oval Office of the White House, Mount Rushmore's presidential carvings, and Air Force One. Side boxes on several of the pages offer interesting tidbits about the nation's commanders: Grover Cleveland, for example, was the first president to have a child born in the White House. This event inspired a candy bar named after his daughter: Baby Ruth. Children won't come away from this booklet with a comprehensive knowledge of the presidents, but it will be an entertaining introduction to some of the most powerful men in history.
