okay guys, this is crazy - so crazy in fact that I thought it was a hoax until I started seeing the photographic proof that these people are actually giving away iPods.  So I signed up.  If you want a free one you should sign up too.  But first read  urlLink  this  and make sure to sign up using me as a  urlLink referral   urlLink freeiPods.com   Okay if that wasn't enough you can use the same company to get yerself a free 27" Sony WEGA flatscreen TV  urlLink FreeFlatScreens  again use my  urlLink referral code   The Hitch:  1:  You have to sign up for a free offer (you know how those work - sign up and cancel before they start charging you AND 2:  You have to refer so many people (5-8) who each have to sign up for an offer. Is this a pain?  Yea kinda, but if it means getting a free iPod or TV out of the deal I can live with it.
