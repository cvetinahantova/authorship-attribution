urlLink       ::sigh:: Fridays are teh suck. I show up for chapel at 9, then I have NOTHING until 2:00. No car either. So, here I am in the computer lab, getting a head start on final projects (yes, the first fweaking week of the semester) like the uber-nerd I am.  And now...it's  Heather Quote Time!   I must toot my own horn here and say that I've spouted a few zingers this week. Mainly out of nervousness, which I combat with sarcasm. Anyway, here's a few memorable ones...  "Her bitchiness was like a cancer that started in her nipples and slowly made their way up into her brain." (Describing a former colleague of Andy's and mine.)  "I really missed you today. I saw a VW and had to hit myself." (To Andy, my constant "slug-bug" companion)  "You know, some mornings, you're walking along, and the air is fresh, and you're sipping spiced tea, and you just have to smile and wonder to yourself,  Where the heck am I anyway ?"  Have a good day.
