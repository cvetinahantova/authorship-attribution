A few weeks ago, I spent time in the North Cascades (Washington State) on an Outward Bound canoeing/backpacking trip. Wow! It was amazing to see how eight teachers could come together in such a short amount of time. Normally on longer Outward Bound trips, participants spend several days on a solo expedition. The solo is not about survival, it's about reflection. We had an opportunity to complete a four-hour solo. Here are some things I wrote during that time...  June 24, 2004 I am happy here and now All alone, among the creaking trees The constant wind in my ears The lake sparkles below me Reminding me of distances paddled, strokes learned, steering perfected, Devil's Creek gorge explored White water rocks the boat, prevents steady paddling  Aspen leaves stick to green leaves on the forest floor, like cobwebs of the past Skeletons of yesterday I compulsively want to pick them off-- like dead skin but I refrain The skin of the forest  I'm shedding my outer shell of emotional wall The trees above sway dangerously back and forth, left and right but I am safe, not afraid  A chipmunk scurries to and fro and sounds like a giant on crushed leaves I am in control but the weather washes over me The mountains rise above me to tell me there is always something for which to strive  Though I will never climb Mt. Everest I will admire the view from Desolation Peak and feel like I'm on top of the world- my reward for struggling not the weakest link an equal contributing member of the expedition team singing, flowering, throwing snowballs, smiling, thinkng  Moss is soft and comfortable Maybe my favorite plant  What would make this time better Is someone to share it with Someone to kiss and hug and cuddle  From here I see no one, hear no one, talk with no one, my company is Mother Earth and me I am at Peace.  ~~~~~~~~~ Two songs were running through my head as I sat among the leaves and trees:  Peace, I ask of thee o River Peace, peace, peace When I learn to live serenely Cares will cease From the hills I gather courage Visions of the day to be Strength to lead and faith to follow All are given unto me Peace I ask of the o River Peace, peace, peace ~~~~~  You must give yourself to love If love is what you're after Open up your heart to The tears and laughter and Give yourself to love  I've walked these mountains in the rain I've learned to love the wind I've been up before the sunrise to watch the day begin I always knew I'd find you, though I never did know how Like sunshine on a cloudy day You stand before me now
