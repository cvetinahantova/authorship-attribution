There's a real-life Tarzan/Romulus/Remus.  Sort of.  He was  urlLink raised by chickens  (Via  urlLink Fark ).  I really want this to be cool, but I just feel bad for the guy.  The only thing lamer than being raised by chickens is... I don't know.  It's pretty much entirely uncool.  Even pigeons would be better.  Anything.   And  he is an orphan  and  this is all the result of blatant abuse (As opposed to, say, high adventure).  What a drag.
