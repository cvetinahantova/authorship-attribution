Quick Note:    Tonight we didn't have a usual life group meeting. Angela, Adela, Danielle, Tinamarie, Vince and I headed out to Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa to their worship night. It was awesome! The place got packed. The worship and teaching was good. It was amazing to see some people receive christ. Keep them in prayer.The ride and fellowship was good too!!=) We were going to go watch the movie the notebook afterwards but Danielle got a call that one of her friends broke her collar bone so she went to go visit her. It was cool though because on the way back we were driving on the 605 N comming home and they started talking about the bingo club right off of south st. I shared that my dad works there and Vince was like so you know where San Pedro's Tacos is??? which is a taco restaurant across the street. And I was like YES! So we were driving and I was like you want to go??? And everyone was like YEAH!! so instead of going to the movies we had dinner there!! It was yummy and we were just chattting. I had a good time!!! Well I am tired I will hollar at ya'll later Good night  God Bless you all.
