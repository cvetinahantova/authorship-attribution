Sorry I didn't get to write yesterday, it was a busy day.  I had a dentist appointment and then had to run errands and didn't get to write to the blog or do much of anything.  Well anyway my life is pretty exciting, probably because it is New Years Eve.  I am also going to clean out the home office today and do some organizing for my mom.  I did sleep in late today though.  I got up at 10:30!  That may not be late for you, but for me that is vvvvveryyyyyyyyy late!!!Nothing much has happened in the community so not much to say there.  I am so happy that I don't have to start school back for another week!  My sister has to start back on Monday.  Of course she deserves it.  I love getting to sleep in late and not have to worry about tests, homework, teachers, quizzes, FINALS!  But I know that I will  have to go back sometime, but until then it is party time :)  I am also happy because my mother got her 4-runner back and we no longer have to ride in the company car, thankgoodness.  Also be prepared for some changes in my website design.  I am looking for a whole new look.  Dont know when it will change, but it will.  If you know of any place to find or have suggestions yourself for backgrounds, feel free to e-mail them to me.
