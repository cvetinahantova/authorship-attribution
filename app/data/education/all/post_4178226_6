Here's an interesting little bit-o-fun I stumbled across today:  urlLink SpaceFem  has some time-wasters (i.e., quizzes) on her site, and I just took the Militant Feminist Quiz. Here are my results:   ___________________________________________    urlLink      I'm getting there.  I don't suck, but I've got a ways to go.    ___________________________________________    Make of that what you will ... Anyway, I also took her Geek Time quiz, and apparently I am a 1970's geek. Um, not quite sure what that means, but there you have it.    Speaking of Internet quizzes, I always enjoy the time I waste over at  urlLink Tickle , formerly eMode. Frankly, the site was way better when it  was  eMode, before Tickle came along and added all the bullshit with the personals. I was happy with just the tests, what did they need to go and attatch "matchmaking and social networking"?! I guess there just aren't enough websites for such things. What  ever   ...    I also came across a virtual pet adoption link on  urlLink Resevoir Kitten's blog  over at  urlLink tBlog . Scroll down the sidebar to see this blog's new mascot, Killer, the White Rabbit. BTW, when you click on him, he jumps! W00t! If you'd like a virtual pet for your own web page, go to  urlLink Bunnyhero Lab's Adoption Centre . In addition to rabbits, they have puppies, kittens, ducks, and penguins. Also dragons, "coming soon."  And lastly, thanks to  urlLink MyCartoonDolls  for providing "adoptable" avatars; I chose one for this site from their Irish Eyes collection.
