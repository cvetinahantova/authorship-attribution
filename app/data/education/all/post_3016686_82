urlLink The Hidden Cameras   sound so sweet but they are not for the faint of heart. Lisa introduced me to them and their first CD, called  urlLink  The Smell Of Our Own   and now they have a new record out in England called  urlLink  Mississauga Goddam   (a clever play on "Mississippi Goddamn" by Nina Simone).  It's due out here in September. They're Canadian and sound is folky and very choral - kind of like Belle And Sebastian with harmonies (am I right?). They have also been called the Gay Polyphonic Spree, which is apt.  But children beware:  the sweet voices mask rannnnndy lyrics. A sample of " urlLink Golden Streams " here:      The golden stone builds the golden road to heaven    Held up high by golden streams of ice    My golden bone meets the golden buns    Buns held high in our dreams of men      And that is  minor  compared to the lyrics of " urlLink The Man That I Am With My Man "!! It all reads as crackpot, yet they  are  amusing on record. The new record has titles like "Music Is My Boyfriend," "I Want Another Enema" and  "Builds The Bone," but somehow this group adds up to more than novelty and they are getting  urlLink good reviews .      Note that Amazon has them linked with The Shins, Postal Service, Broken Social Scene and Death Cab for Cutie, among others.  Just to give you a reference point or four! I don't have the new record, but if I hear it, I will comment on the blog. It's a big hit on  urlLink Popjustice , my new fave site.
