My tennis elbow is a bit bad today. You know, I don't play tennis. I just spend my day here sitting in front of the computer. It hurts like hell actually.  Today doesn't feel like its going to be really hot. The weather was hazy but nice, it was fresh but humid. Who the hell cares?  Well, if you live in a place that can become an inferno in less than 2 hours you would. Temperatures around 38C are expected later this week, that means it will probably feel like 45C in this humidity saturated hell hole. To the imperialists, 45C is way too hot.   But it is a bit unfair to call it a hell hole, it can be a beautiful place, with gorgeous mountain framed sunsets and spectacular cloud effects. I enjoy watching the mountain every time I drive home from work. I can get lost in its deep misty ravines and am myself mystified by its white faces of rock around its tops. I wish I could be a cloud, and roll down its green sides, scratching the unscratchable depths of my soul with the tips of its evergreens.   Too bad... I could have been a poet or a thief...  if you know what I mean.   I saw a tv programme (  How I like this girl. I wonder what music she likes.
