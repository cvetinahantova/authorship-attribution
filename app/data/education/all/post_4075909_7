I was just about to drive my mom over to the bank and I received my mail.  As you all know I do business over amazon.com. Well, I recently sold a copy of Harriet the Spy. It was in fine condition when sold. To my surprise I got a letter telling my I would be reported if I sell poor quality merchandise. I put the tape in my VCR and it was fine. First I thought this person was crazy because she comes from Missouri and we all know what happened in that state yesterday.  God forbid gay people get married, we might all save this country from debt.  So, I called and complained to the main amazon.com branch and refunded the money, (which this person did not ask for).  This person is still crazy, I know.  But, she probably wanted to watch the VHS and then return it...whatever.  Other than that I found out Edie Falco had breast cancer, which is the reason for the short hair.  I met her once and she is a very nice person.  I am looking forward to seeing her on Broadway with the very talented Brenda Blethyn.  Right now, I'm waiting for Mario Cantone in Laugh Whore.  I saw this two years ago and almost peed in my pants, the man is funny, deserved a Tony and is extremely funny and too nice, I love him, I want to adopt him!  I told him so...LOL!  Ok, that's enough, I have go clean out my dogs ears, they are turning like grade old cheese.
