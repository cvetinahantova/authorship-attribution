I despise summer with every fiber of my being.  I actually like my work (as an academic), and I also like my work environment to be active and flourishing.  Campus is dead as a doornail, even with summer classes in session, and it slows down the pace of my work, which is a Bad Thing when I have so much of it to do.  June was quite the struggle this year--it is usually July before I start to drag down.  The next six months will weigh on me heavily, and I want September to come around so that I can have people to lean on.  However, I can take solace in the fact that one-third of the Wretched Three Months has passed (and August will be much more active than it usually is, since I will be taking a little vacation).  July will be rough--it will be all work and very little play.  Still, if I can be productive during the month, it will go a long way toward making me a much happier person.  The month will end with a visit from Jessica, which is something to look forward to, and my move will also take place during this month, clearing August for the "fun stuff" of getting geared up for the next academic year.  So, at any rate, July, enjoy your reign.  --Varenia
