Your special day   Your special day is not  entirely made up of the  usual smiles, the usual  tongue wrestling kisses. Oh no it calls, for something extraordinary. A brilliant, ingenious brew of hedonistic delight with divinely inspired  appetisers and desserts.  Perhaps to start off  a skirt reminiscent of lolita and strappy heels to compliment a virginal white blouse with no frills.  Then as the appetiser whisks by you smell the innocent floral scent like mint dressing on tender lamp chops.   In case you're still dreaming  then well-toned legs earned from hours in the gym will wrap around your waist and the main course can begin.   Any girl who loves you this much would do all of the above and more.  They could moan and promise to love you forever, until the next moon and lifetime.  As they melt in your mouth, their passionate replies would gratify your desires and when you are finished, there won't be  anything left to find fault with.  So what has a virgin,  with God's given gift of temperance, anything left to offer you?  Surely her knitted sweaters and home-made cards  will find a cosy space in the back of your mind sooner than the just baked brownies on the table.   For each bite from the edge to the heart of its chocolate centre, you remember the times when coming home brought relief and comfort to your free-ranging spirit in the world.  For each nut you encounter, memories of her trigger beginning with the time you peeked at her changing, seeing her silhoutte on the curtains.  There weren't many nuts but they were just enough to bring you to the point when she wrote her first poem for you, after all  the love letters you've sent.   Your special day, I didn't forget.  Of course I have a gift.  It's a fortune cookie with a message in it. When you're finished with the appetisers,  main course and dessert,  you'll find my gift still there  and a message that will tell you what all of this means.  But till then,  how can i spoil the surprise?
