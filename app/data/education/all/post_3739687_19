hello fam and friends,  well.  i made the bus this morning.  i got to the station 45 minutes ahead of time just to make sure and i called and harrassed the woman to tell me exactly where i was supposed to stand and what the bus would look like.  anyway... i got on it just fine.  it was a very nice aircon bus that served us sushi (not great but edible) and constantly provided us with a our choice of pepsi, tea or water.  i'm glad i went with one of the services that does everything for you instead of just going to the bus station and arranging the travel myself.  the part of cambodia we went to, poi pet, was very scary.  i was encouraged to keep my bag in front of me and the tour/border run guides kept a close eye on anyone coming up to me because i was one of only two westerners on the bus and the only western female.  there were beggars everywhere many of  them children running up to me asking for a single baht. also, many people missing arms or legs laying around and one man with only his right leg.  i was afraid to take out my camera to take a picture even. well honestly i didn't want a record of the event.  what's more amazing is that after crossing into cambodia they put us in a van and took us maybe 1/4 of a mile to a casino where they was a full buffet a all types of food available.  mainly asian food but some american style items also.  strange how people were starving just right down the road.  made me feel guilty when i went back for second helping.  well gotta run.  i'm a little depressed now that i put the experience into words.  jane
