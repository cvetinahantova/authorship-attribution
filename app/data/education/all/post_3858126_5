Well, here I am in England.   I was expecting the weather to be cold and dismal... Well, the dismal part is right. It is cloudy and constantly threatening to be rainy, but it is also humid and hot - even though the temperature is probably only about 24 degrees C! I arrived yesterday after a very bumpy flight that stopped at Athens airport for 4 hours! There I bought a nice bottle of perfume and read my book. I even took a little nap!  So what has happened to me since my arrival? Well, I have visited two pubs and eaten various pork varieties. Most notable was the breakfast this morning of eggs and maple cured bacon. Sorry to offend any not-eating-pork people, but I have missed this food!  I went to bed earlier than I have done in a while and I woke up earlier than I have done in a while. Maybe it's jet lag, I don't know. After breakfast, I turned on the TV and watched various movies that I haven't had the luxury of seeing. They were all linked together by the presence of different actors. It was uncanny. Then I turned on the Sci-Fi Channel (Kimberly would be jealous at this as our TV is not working well yet) and there I watched  urlLink Farscape   and was hooked. I just think John Crichton (aka Ben Browder) looks hot in his tight leather trousers! It's a good show, shame it's been cancelled!  Anyway, the prospects for today: go to the pub, enjoy the sticky hot weather of England and watch TV. Tomorrow I shall go and investigate town life! It's funny seeing kids coming home from school (my school ended a month ago!) and it will be even funnier when the weekend starts a day later than I am used to!  Oh well, good bye from mighty blighty!
