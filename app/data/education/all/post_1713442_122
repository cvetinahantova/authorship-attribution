urlLink FIFA.COM The Official web site of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association  Hard as it is to believe, qualifying matches for the 2006 FIFA Soccer World Cup have already started in some regions.  The official approval for all the draws was done today.  The USA gets a bye in the 1st round of qualifying but will have matches next year.  Much to the astonishment of the world, the USA finished 8th out of 32 teams in 2002.  This included some big wins over Portugal and Mexico.  I am all for the USA winning the next World Cup.  Wouldn't that be something?  All those American hating countries would have to live with the fact that a soccer (football) indifferent USA can beat the world at it's own sport.  Heck, if the USA wins in 2006, we can put the soccer balls away and retire from the game on top.
