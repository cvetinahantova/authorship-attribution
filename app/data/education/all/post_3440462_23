Ah, yes; Let the madness officially begin:  the Title of the sixth Harry Potter book was released today by J.K. Rowling, though no word yet as to when to expect publication.  I, personally was a late-comer to the Harry Potter madness; but I did read the fifth book (Order of Phoenix) in one sitting on the day it was released, so I guess you could say I have caught the bug.  Oh, by the way the title is "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"  Any speculation on who this "Half Blood Prince" is? urlLink The Next Harry Potter Book
