From  urlLink Reuters  Saturday:  "Two British policemen have been suspended from duty after a newspaper reported they had been filmed enjoying the attentions of porn stars while they were supposed to be on patrol.  The News of the World reported Sunday that the two policemen, aged 30 and 34, had been called to calm down a crowd who spotted a pornographic movie being filmed in a street in London's Soho district.    But the officers talked their way into the film crew's van and allowed the two female stars to perform a sex act on them, while the crew secretly rolled the cameras, the paper said."   Abuse of power at its finest.   Cokemaster and the Russian's across-the-pond doppelgangers.   In other news (also reported by Reuters):  "A wheelchair-bound woman with no limbs sued Air France for discrimination on Friday, alleging she was kept off a flight by a gate agent who told her a 'torso cannot possibly fly on its own.'"   The article fails to include the transcript from the rest of the gate agent/torso confrontation.  The "torso," a Ms. Adele Price, retorted:   "Oh, I see.  Running away, eh?  You yellow bastard.  Come back here and take what's coming to you.  I'll bite your legs off!"
