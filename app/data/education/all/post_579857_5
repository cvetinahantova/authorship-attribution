i feel very displaced right now. i havent gone to morning prayer since last week. i just wake up, eat, get ready for work, work, come back to the apt to eat and watch tv, take care of pookie, then talk on AIM till it's too late and repeat.   i've been experiencing a lot about double-motives. whether it is brought up by someone or comes from something i read or listen to. what is God trying to teach me? i know i need discipline and even ask for it on occasion. why does God love me so much? i want to get myself out of this slump, i dont like it at all. i feel distant from people and God. but the true answer is...  i need God. only by the grace and mercy of God. go to the cross!
