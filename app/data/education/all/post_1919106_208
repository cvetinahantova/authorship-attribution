... But I won't have any because I don't have anyone to drink  with  and drinking alone is just not right.  Anyway, the situation with dad is as follows: He's throwing the whole  "Oh I'm dying, I'm so depressed, nobody loves me"  act. There's more to that, but I'll stop there. And he's done it before I'm told. So after going today to see what the whole situation is I've come to the conclusion that I'd better put some distance between myself and the whole shit. I don't drag  them  into my problems, so I don't want them to drag  me  into theirs. And my stepbrothers and sisters pretty much agree there. I did a last thing out of pure nicety which was to bring everyone else in the family who has a fucking life up to date, but things are stopping there. I can't afford to sacrifice half my day for this shit, and contrary to the beliefs of some people, I do have a life, and a pretty busy one on top of that.  As for dad's health situation, it seems to be either a pulmonar infection or a heart condition (or possibly both or one that cascaded into the other). However, it's nothing that should be a problem if takes care of himself. Which is the tough part, because he's a stubborn bastard. But whatever happens I'm staying out of it.  Now, there is still part of the evening left, the sun is shining, and I intend to enjoy it and  The Confusion . And I will let nothing short of bad weather or an alien abduction ruin that.
