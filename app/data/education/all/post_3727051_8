On the way home from work yesterday, we passed my husband heading to town.  I got that sinking feeling of impending doom in my stomach, which I pushed aside in favor of more positive thoughts.  Sure enough, when he called (which in itself is an improvement), he was on his way to a meeting!!    WOO HOO!!!    He also called when he was on his way home.  I made sure to let him know how proud I was of him - making the first step is always hard.  He told me the hardest part was admitting that he screwed up 11 1/2 years of sobriety.  I am cautiously optimistic that we are on an uphill trend.  He still needs to make an appointment for the substance abuse counselor and continue to go to his meetings.  I have to work on helping him raise his self-esteem and his confidence in himself.  We both have a lot to work on, but I think we are going in the right direction.
