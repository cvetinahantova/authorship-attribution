I am afraid, Lord.   My soul is aching and I weep for the passion that does not exist.  Our lives are too easy, too difficult - a paradox of crippling proportions.  The only thing worth having is painfully eating away at me until I am afraid of death, but to forsake the painful necessary is to embrace a deadly pleasure.  Sweet nectar that pleases the palette but rots the belly.  Only clutching the worthwhile, the painful, the searing flames that devour all things but that golden nugget of truth, I find purpose and vitality.
