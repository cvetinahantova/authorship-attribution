I was looking for art programs where I'm going to study. But there isn't any. I'm going to an art school anyways. But really? I wanted art, there's no other place right now near here to go to a degree in art so I have to do that for starters. I'm studying psychology by the way. But my true passion, apart from helping others with their problems, it's art. And since I was a little girl I've been dreaming of traveling the world and drawing smile on the faces of others with my art. And transport everyone into my world through it. And it has been the only dream that has truly lasted this long. But things aren't that easy, so I have to take one step at a time. But in the school I'm going I have lots of chances. They even give exhibitions to Spain. So I got a great chance to fulfill my dream. Even though I never had Spain on my future plans. I must say, everything points to Spain and that I will start there. First Spain, then England, then the World! I know I will do it. I don't know how, or when, but I do know it WILL happen. That's the power of manifestation. And I have lots of time to work with that manifestation. :D
