You know... death should always be a possible side-effect. Of course, I suppose they only include the ones that are a direct cause of the product. But, for example, something that may cause drowsiness could cause you to fall asleep while driving or walking on a narrow catwalk.  Of course, then they'd have to include every possible way that falling asleep could kill you... fall asleep and drown, fall asleep and fall off of a train platform, etc.  It's amazing the kinds of things people get away with in court these days. It's crazy, because it's not like they could make small claims a thing of the past, because then people would just start shooting each other, or whatever they could do.  Anyway, that's the random pile o' whatever for now.    Current Music: Lisa Gerrard - Gortoz A Ran
