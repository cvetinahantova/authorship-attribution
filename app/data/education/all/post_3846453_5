Hummm hummm hummmm chicken. I'm sitting in Maths  meant  to be doing Mathsy Work. Chellsy is searching her name on Google, and Sumbal is searching my name, and coming up with horses. Thanks. But, she is searching my  real  name, as Jimzy didn't have any results.  Sniff sniff.  Pelin is exclaiming her suprise about Chellsy's obessions of Smelly Desmonds. Oo....Sim has found pictures of MPF, and lots of little froggies, I like froggies I do. She's found a new bacground for our website, when she sends it to me, I'll put is as the homepage possibly??? Her arm hurts, as she had an injection yesterday. I managed to dodge it, as I forgot my slip to permissionize it. (?) I can't hit her anymore without feeling the slightest bit guilty. I don't abuse her or anything, I just playfully hit her as a sign of........... ummmm..... Froggyness.
