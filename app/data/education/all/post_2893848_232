Beauty Considered    urlLink The NYTimes misses the point on reality television and plastic beauty .  The problem isn't that we're all going to look the same, or that beauty will become boring, but that the relationship between the product and the consumer has become so tricky as to be much more than simply disingenuous.  What we think we want isn't what we actually want, and what we're getting isn't so much either as it is universal in whatever it actually is (outrageous, if you ask  urlLink Chicha , but I think it can be other things as well; the point is not how it hits us, but that it hit a majority of us the same way.)    A good example of this is market-researched endings to movies.  Does anyone really like those endings in which, despite the combined inertia of character, plot, plausibility and logic, everything works out?  I'm not sure; probably someone does.  Grandmas go to the movies too.  But the more more important point may be that fewer people staunchly object to these endings; we know that good art ultimately makes us happy, but that doesn't mean it  is  happy.  (Perhaps the real problem is a widespread confusion of satisfaction and happiness.  I might even confuse the two as I write this.)        Just as in the past we all became armchair psychologists, now we have all become armchair Ad-men.  We think we are savvy to market forces and cynically aware of how we are manipulated.  But we still buy the same shit, and just as much of it.  Our cynicism has been acknowledged and appropriated.  It strikes me that our two choices this November are the outright consequence of this trend: a conservative who talks like a liberal, and a liberal whose supporters vote for him mostly because they're pretty sure others will as well.
