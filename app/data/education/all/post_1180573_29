farewell, my enschede...   never thought that this day would come this fast  never imagined that it would be this hard to be passed  however, the moment has come, at last  drawing this wonderful world into my past   but not even a wisp of cloud will i bring away cause  i'm the one to go and the world should stay  [joy, pain, happiness, sadness, laughter, and sorrow]  may this inspiring memories be with me forever and impermeably
