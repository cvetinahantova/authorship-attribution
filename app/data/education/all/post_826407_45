I really shouted at a class this week, not just acting, like almost anger.  It was quite convincing I thought and nearly got them listening until the worst happened.  I was at the peak of my amplified announcement when I noticed a large bubble of spit flying out of my mouth.  By now it was too late to stop.  I continued speaking.  The spit continued flying across my desk and plopped gracefully on between to keen girls on the front row.    What should I do?  Acknowledge it and laugh?  Oh No!  Ignore it and carry on, better, but then I become the stupid teacher who spits when he's cross and doesn't know it.  there are easier ways to earn a living.   Got the  urlLink Flip Flop Flyin Minipops Poster  as a late anniversary present from Helen today,  Hooray!  Thank You H.
