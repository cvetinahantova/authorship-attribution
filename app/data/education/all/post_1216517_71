A poem by me 2002  the grand easter day hunt for music to identify with, to fry eggs with, to ride down sunset drive with.  listening for that perfect tune that plucks the string of the inner ukalaele and makes it sing more sweetly than any hawaiian ever could--that including don ho, hawaii 5-0, and magnum p.i. too (hawaii.  hawaii.  visions of mini scooters rented for dollars a day, buzzed down streets, and zipped around turns.  images of hikes up volcano cliffs christmas day. a call to mom.  a call to dad.  sorry disconnected before the call was made.  dreams of a colorful tent next to a palm and a bush and wet water splashing all night.  thoughts of that waterfall and that magnificently-shaped texan and the mango we shared [reminding me of a seductive blonde wal-mart girl.  softball player, cigarette breath. a few years my senior.  that night on the boat.  on the road.  in the water.  the sheepdog-sans the sheep-saved the day.  how much did it save when i always want that moment back, recalling in my mind, fighting for a chance not to be the next contestant on 'the waiting game.'  a few hours after, a call to confess and a chance to rest and thank God that He's still there.  however, i voided it all in the preceeding weeks with another summer fling, gave away my ring, filled my hole with helium and it rose to the top.  one down, more to go, an attempt to believe one's better than the other when i'm the one that needs to go {one and then another and then something else.  it was a tiny italian, cocoa shirley temple locks, the best laugh i've ever heard from a female, and she was my type.  God, she was, if there ever was one.  Her smile.  her eyes, that seductive glance without even trying.  we talked of india and united airlines visits to philadelphia.  (i still want to see the liberty bell and the 'rocky' stairs) and...my first kiss.  i stole it in the aisle of an airport souvenir shop.  miami.  we had cuban coffee and laid on the roof of a hotel and dreamed big dreams in front of the atlantic ocean.  that day my favorite ballplayer got traded.  that day i was in love with a tiny italian with cocoa shirley temple locks.  she had that smile too.  that smile.  she was wearing combat boots. and my heart  }]). still the continued search for the perfect song to medicate emotions.  after you feel a little bit of your past in every nice skirt you see.  and the sun goes down and the eyelids go up and dreams disappear and the light turns on and the covers come off and the clothes come on and on and on.  a temporary remedy: a well-placed song.   Spring 2002 It�s fairly simple to toss truth out the window when you feel it doesn�t apply.  But that�s like stargazing at the sun or mooning a planet or visa versa.  Objectively, you realize there�s no need to notice the bluebirds flying when they don�t notice you.  And you know what else?  You can�t see the sky.  That�s why reality TV is such a lie.  We know it�s not real, but choose to believe.  Needing that feeling even if being a fool is the price we pay, permitting ourselves to be transfixed by the pendulum swing of that ubiquitous stopwatch.  Getting sleeeepy.  Sleeeeepy.  Until next thing we know, we dream we�re surrounded by cats and mushrooms and police and one of them is dancing, but we�re afraid to find the function of each.  Or are we the dancing ones?  If so, who gave us lessons?  And why did they want to teach us?  Trying to single out a memory like that from the dark recesses is like a midnight ride on an inbound train from Berlin to Barcelona with a nice little smoke break in between in good ole� Pair-ee with their so-called idealism and dainty little arch and eyesore phallic art.  One shall be stumped for many moons about whether or not they realize their gall, or if it�s all just an act.  Act?  Pah!  It doesn�t matter.  The constant click of the train on the track is an obvious reaction from the friction it creates, or endures, or is pleased to feel like a dirty little deed afterwork for an overweight, middle-age businessman from the suburbs; tired with his wife, rather, didn�t give her a chance; turned off to her the faucet of his affection and dried his hands on his pants.  And what does he think about when he comes home and tucks his kids in at night?  And can you blame him?  Or feel the same as him?  He�s not the only one.  He�s only one.  Among one, among one, taking the desert drive from a dirty city to a dirty dive and the one�s that know they�ve lost are the one�s who stay alive to travel back to the dirty little city from the dirty little dive.  Spring 2002 we took an oceanside drive, parked under a tree, and snuck out on the beach with a  bottle of bacardi, case of sapporo, and a 2-liter coke.  on the way down to the water, they were terrified by a couple skunks we encountered playing on a well-lit picnic table.  (�they can spray up to twenty feet.�)  we continued down the trail.  the ocean ahead was a mural of darkness.  (�what if a sea monster came out and ate us?)  we stopped to check our supplies at a bench before a bend that went downwards to the left.  i hid in a cave and pretended to be a bear.  we descended, crossed the tracks, and invaded the empty beach.  a train went by too quickly, but i remembered to place a coin for next time.  after a while on the sand, we relocated to the rocks and talked of struggles,  expression, regret and depression.  we commented on the female anatomy.  i learned how to inhale a cigarette.  i made two flattened pennies and a quarter.  as the alcohol was slowly sipped (the styrofoam cups taken from beneath the soda fountain worked just fine), things became more interesting.  we were all intrigued by the indian trick of putting one�s ear to the rail to feel the oncoming train.  it never worked.  one time it took more than flashing lights to peel his head from the steel.  i yelled and called him a dumb ______ ______.  the suggested moments of solitude were an excellent segue to leaving.  after throwing cans in the trash, we noticed a paper under the wiper.  it was a forty-four dollar ticket that i agreed to pay a third of.  Spring 2002 i shouldn�t care it she got her hat in cuba, or how she does her hair, or if she looks good in those pants, or whether or not i like her just because she reminds me of sarah.  is it human to throw down the phone when you think you�ve dialed her home number?  or see her face in place of those of foreign actresses?  or to repeatedly sing a beatles tune just because her name is there?  is it odd that i play out scenarios in my head but dread ever actually talking to her, let alone marrying her?  is she ideal or just set up as a strawwoman (beautifully clothed, tight bodied, but a strawwoman nonetheless), set to collapse the moment i approach/get near.  that�s my real fear; that she isn�t perfect.  the answer is clear but i have hypnotized my mind to believe a lie i�ve implanted deep to avoid the truth i don�t want to hear so i can delay the inevitable death of the perfect girl in my life.  Spring 2002  I heard a song today  that didn�t remind me of anything, but still made me cry.  i sat in my car, leaning across the seats, listening to it on repeat.  i fell asleep. then woke up three hours later  with the tears dried in the corners of my eyes  and the song not quite over.  3-24-02  Over Halfway (for Trevor)  a roof with well-placed spirits and smoke is all friends need to grieve the fragmented past.
