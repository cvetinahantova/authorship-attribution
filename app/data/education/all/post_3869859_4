So what's the difference, you might ask? Etymologically, the two words are quite similar. I was quite confused for the first several weeks of working at NASA, since the building I work in houses the Astrobiology Institute. It turns out, however, that the Astrobiology Institute is on the first floor, and my office is on the second floor, in the life sciences division. I work for the Bioastronautics group which is located at Johnson Space Center, in Houston.     Astrobiology: the search for life elsewhere in the universe.   Bioastronautics: seeking to understand the effects of microgravity on astronauts' bodies.     Aha!
