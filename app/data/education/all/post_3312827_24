Yeah, ok, so I said I didn't want to be Bridget Jones last night, right?  Well, in the meantime, I struck up a conversation with another Match.com boy.  My age, but WAY more mature than these other goofballs.  I don't even dare risk saying his name for the fear that I will jinx myself into ruining even a friendship with him.  I love Holly.  Even though she's married now, I can still complain to her about guys and she understands.  Plus, she encourages my relationship with God and reminds me that if I give my life up to Him, He will provide.  I have to remember to let live and let God.  Don't get me wrong, though, this is not a blind faith.  Those of you who know me know that I am pretty turned off by "those kind" of people.  Don't think that I've gone Bible-thumper on you all...  I haven't.  :)  Hopefully today at work I'll remember everything I'm supposed to do, and I'll do it quickly.  Every day is a bit better than the last, right?  Maybe I'll even get a chance to eat something, which I didn't the other day.  DAYS TILL D-DAY:  3
