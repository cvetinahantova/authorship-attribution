Took an extra hour for lunch and went into the City Centre to meet Angela of all people. She had come over with a friend who had some work to do. Totally spontaneous, not pre-arranged or anything, she just emailed and said she was coming over to do shome shopping. I've not even shaved, brushed my teeth and I'm wearing trampy clothes today....bloody typical!  We had agreed on just meeting as friends for coffee - nothing more, but during the last couple of days we had had a couple of heart to hearts and she had come to realise that I was indeed telling the truth and not just after her as another woman on the side, or sexual conquest.  After walking to the shopping centre on the other side of town, I went to put my arm round her as a form of support when she was telling me something - just to say I was there if she needed it. She immediately came forward and kissed me - for ages - in the middle of the street, with loads of people around. The most unromantic place, the most unromantic time, but it just felt so right, so natural, so .....nice! We never made the coffee place, we stood overlooking the church, talking, hugging, kissing, listening and caring about each other. It felt soooo nice to be wanted and to feel appreciated. Not sex, not perverted, just simple feelings of happiness.  WOW!
