Won some money on mahjong today but not without a cost. Donno wat happened but i had some pain at my abdomen area ( ard 4th quadrant)  throughout the game...not sure if it is stomachache or wat... reached home at ard 7.30am and decided to take a sleep but as usual the noise level is not that acceptable for me to sleep in peace. Interestingly, i did not yell at anyone to keep quiet. Hahaha.....maybe win money, today good mood so neber throw my temper. Just "try" sleep....managed to do that till 2pm. Had lunch and going back to sleep again liao.  signing off: Stomach Pain Pain Stomach Stomach Pain Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
