it's monday afternoon, 15 minutes before analysis class... i dropped my parents off at the train station half an hour ago, and by now they should be boarded to catch their ride to the airport.  it's been a fun weekend, but kinda weird.  (1) i enjoy visiting with my parents, especially mom... but dad has a tendency to ask questions or make outrageous statements and get mad when the answer to a question is "same as i told you an hour ago" or i correct the outrageous statement in question and ask "are you listening to yourself?"  he means well, but he has a tendency to try my patience... on the whole he was mostly good this weekend just forgetful and repetative.  (2) mom has a tendency to see me as a friend (which is a good thing!) but then has a tendency to start telling me things about her and dad, forgetting the "daughter" aspect of things might make it so that there's some things i just don't want to know.  enough said.  (3) i spend so much time with my math people, it was completely bizarre not to see any of them all weekend and hear about adventures later on... i had my own quality adventures with the parents, and i'm not complaining or saying i wish things were different... just commenting it was a different kind of weekend. =P  that basically sums it up... now to pay for having fun all weekend, i have to do homework until i spontaneously combust this week... yuck.  at any rate, analysis class calls... later.
