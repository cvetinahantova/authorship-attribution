I find myself in a state of some frustration. This 'last four weeks' business is doing my head right in.   When half term ended, and essays were handed in, and snooze-inducing lectures attended and reunion beers drunk, I kind of, sort of, thought that This would be It.   Stupid,  stupid  me. Now I find my head so full of loose ends you'd think my brain was made of spaghetti. I can't get any focus, any follow-through. My life is a whirl of iddy-biddy, fiddly, nurdly, niggly bits of STUFF that need doing, and trying to get them done is like trying to catch water in a seive.  What I need is a metaphorical bucket. So I looked on Google, and Google offered me...  ...A  urlLink  Death Clock , to tell me when I was going to kick the...   Jesus.
