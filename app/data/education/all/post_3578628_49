Okay, I am just about sick of all the Ben Stiller crap I've been hearing lately.  Here's a guy whose making me laugh day in and day out and all I hear is he's trying to make another Something Bout Mary this and he plays whiney bozos that.  Ok maybe he does overdo it on the typecast roles you know but uh... I don't see you landing the gigs Mr. Big Shot I'll Write An Article on Ben person.  You know, and he's not Oscar award winning.  But he can sure bring home an MTV Movie Award.  Starsky and Hutch awesome!  Dodgeball...soon to be another Stiller favorite.  You don't like it, then shut up and SIT DOWN!
