urlLink Site of the Month Archive  I am pleased to report that this blog has been selected Blog of the Month at  urlLink Joeant . Thanks Aunt Em.  Joeant is an nice volunteer edited directory to the Web.  It only includes quality sites with good content.  While not immune to spam, the review process for new editors makes it hard to get poor quality sites into Joeant.  Try it for a few searches next time rather than Google.  You may have fewer hits but the relevance of those hits might just be better.
