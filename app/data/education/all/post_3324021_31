Since there will most likely be more than just a few posts with the title Homecoming Update I'm putting the date on there from now on. Anyway, I recently received word back from our president on more homecoming stuff. I urge each and every one of our class members to participate in the homecoming preparations, the more support we receive, the better the homecoming festivities we will have.  As of now, no meetings have been set. But if you could help out with any of the following things, please let a Class Officer or Senator know, or tell me and I will relay the message:  -Volunteer Artists to help with the indoor banner -Chaperones for the poster, float, and outdoor decoration parties -Food and Drink for the poster, float, and outdoor decoration parties -Bagels and Juice for our Spirit Day -A place to store decorations -Ten convertible type cars to drive Sophomore Homecoming Court and Student Council Members  Once again if you can help with any of the things listed above, please contact a Class Officer, Senator, or myself. Your help will be greatly appreciated.
