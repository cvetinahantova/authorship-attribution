Funny how God plan our life We can never expect any of it  Like my childhood friend and me  First, you just someone I hated so much when we were kids I really hated you When you pulled my hair in the class, when you made me cried And other things you did when we were kids I swore to cross your name from my friend’s list  Several years had passed us by I even forgot I have you as a friend Then,  in 1998 I screamed so loud in the middle of the night When you called The call turned into a meeting First time we faced each other after ages Then, we lost touch again So did I, forgot about you again  I know an airport is where people say hello and goodbye to their loved ones But I never expected to meet you again in there Though we could only talked for an hour and we said goodbye again At that moment, I could never forget you again Even  we are separated by the sea I have you in my mind  It is Thursday, 9.30 at night When my phone rang and I heard your voice on the line You missed me and I know deep down inside…I miss you too  And this time I will always remember  you in my heart and soul
