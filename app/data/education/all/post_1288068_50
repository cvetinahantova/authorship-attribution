This week I have charged myself with one of my most loathed duties  -  looking for a new flat. Back in ol' Dundee, this was a case of swapping places with a friend of a friend's sister who'd recently split up with her boyfriend/fallen out with her flatmate/had an illegitimate child with her tutor/delete as applicable. In the Big Smoke it is an epic quest that drags on for months and requires the sort of paperwork and initial cash outlay that could be used in a less pompous region to start a small independent state or breakaway republic.  There is also a kind of selective deafness to the lettings agents I have spoken to:  'Hello! I am looking for a one or two bedroom flat near New Cross station please.'   'Hm. What about a studio in Peckham?'   'Ah, well you see that has no bedrooms and is in Peckham, thus the complete opposite of what I am looking for.'   'Does it need to be furnished?'   'Yes it would be best if it had furniture. Beds, at least.'   Well, there's a place in Nunhead. But there's no furniture. Or shower. Or washing machine. Or roof. Or walls.   'I see. That's not really so much a flat then, is it? More a set of ideals.'  And so it goes on. I wish they would just say 'To be honest we haven't got anything that would suit you.' It would make it so much quicker. Honest estate agents.  Honestate Agents!  A new chain of estate agents that promise to be brutally honest.   Strangely similar to my plan for  Intellidressers , where you can have your hair cut and coloured by a stylist with a masters in criminal psychology. Eschew the conversational world of clubbing for one of forensic evidence! Or astrophysics! Or 18th century French literature! You could request the stylist with the specialist subject of your choice. There must be some disillusioned graduates out there who would love a little comb-holster.  Anyway. I think it is time to tidy up the bedroom.
