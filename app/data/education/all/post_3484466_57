Well, I didn't have time to update this morning,  because I woke up a bit late, and the filter on the school computers didn't let  me update either. The proxy we use to bypass the filters tends to conflict with  XML, so that didn't work, either.  Anyway, now I'm home, blah, blah.  Whatever. So, the day... it was a pretty interesting day,  actually... Mr. Dragavon was there today, so 6th period was spent listening to  stories and whatnot... *smiles* Dragavon is so cool. Anyway, we got let out a half hour early and we  stood in line for about 20 minutes to get yearbooks... the damned things are  huge... my math book is smaller! Yeah, so on the bus ride home I decided to see  how many seniors I know, and I must say I knew more than I thought I  did... Oh, and I'll probably be scanning a lot of the  student photos, so be expecting that some time.  Right, well, I'm off for now, but I'll be back  later (as always)  Current Music: Atreyu - Bleeding  Hearts
