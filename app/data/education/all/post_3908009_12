got up a while back. sleep just isnt an option anymore. goin driving in a bit. i hate it when the ones u care for are in need and u feel like there's nothing u can do for them. its a disgusting feeling. especially if ure one of those people that always has to look out for everybody. damn it.  i'm out.
