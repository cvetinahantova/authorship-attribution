"Ohana means family, and family means 'No one gets left behind.'"  I love the Ohana I was born into.  I love the friends that have become my Ohana.  I love the places that have been homes to my Ohana(s).  I love my track team Ohana (credit to Caitlyn).  I love my cats, the sweetest part of my Ohana.  I miss Midnight, who will always be remembered by my Ohana.  I love my Ohanas! They get me through Hell and high water.  I still feel like crying though. I just don't know if I have the strength to.
