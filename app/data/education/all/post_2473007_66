I thrust my hands to the heavens to embrace God and all that He has for me, but I must not lose sight of those in need around me.  It is very easy to reach for someone who cannot be touched with these hands; the real test is reaching out to those who can be touched, nurtured affected.  Loving God without loving men is like setting vague goals and not taking the steps to attain them.  Our love for God is subject to our love for others; Jesus Himself placed the qualifier!
