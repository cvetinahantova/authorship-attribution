in 24 hours i'll be the happiest lara ever... possibly in 22 or 23... in the meantime, analysis is sucking the life out of me... highly unfortunate.  i just want to get at least 50% on the exam so i can keep a B... i don't have a chance at an A anyhow. 50% doesn't sound like much, but my hard-earned midterm grade was a 55... it'll be close.  in other news, blogspot (the site this blog is hosted by) redid its pages today... i like the new look, but i have to pay attention to where i click when i go to post now since it's all different... doht.  back to analysis... oh the joy of hilbert spaces and fourier transforms.  wish me luck!
