Loving someone is to make that special person feel happy. Yet, I made my special one sad again and again. He's such a nice person, so kind, so understanding, so helpful. I always thought, how could I ever hurt this kind of person? However, I still hurt him, very deeply too. I know we spent lots of happy times together, I'll always remember them. As for the unhappy ones, though they are hard to forget, I hope he would forget them gradually and move on. He said he dunno what I exactly want. I didn't meant to quarrel with him, I didn't except those quarrels to have such big impact on him. I really didn't mean to hurt him. I called him today, right after my cca ended, hoping that i could meet him for lunch or something. However, when I called him, he actually hung up the phone without answering it. I admit I was furious and I used my friend's phone to call him. As expected, he answered the call. I thought he did not want to answer my call on purpose and thus, became more furious. Never did I expect him to be injured and was in great pain. I was devastated when I knew about his injury. I finally know why he didn't answer my call. I agree that we are drifting apart already. However, my trust, faith and love for you has not change. Believe me. Don't be confused anymore. My decision is of course not to leave you, but the choice is yours. I believe that our relationship is able to last very long as we are bonded together. This bond did not come easy. Every relationship has its own problems, that's what makes a relationship stronger, isn't it? I really hope that this relationship with my special one would not end this easily, coz I really really love my special one alot...
