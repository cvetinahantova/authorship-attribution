i'm having a great day!  first, i was able to remember to bring lunch so i'm a little closer to buying my own guitar. my parents agreed to share it with me. then, we had our computer today and i was able to see sir ralph for countless times. lastly, i was able to talk to jammi! he called and told me he had been calling for a couple of days now and he left me messages. it was so sweet of him. i had a great time. ^_^  *** i've been meeting a lot of new people lately. it's fun to meet new friends!  *** my seatmate, denise, was transferred because a couple of teachers gave mrs. dela cruz feedbacks that i was noisy. hey, is it my fault that i can listen to the teacher, write notes and chat with my seatmate at the same time?  *** i started making this comic about mimi and jammi, my two fave characters. it so cool and many of my classmates really like it! so far, i have three episodes, one crosswise each.
