The "winner" became incensed and has countered with  urlLink this post .     In it he poses some questions. So I thought it would be adequate if I were to answer his queries. "moron...imbecile...is that the best you can do?" Hurray for you. You figured out how to make a question mark. With all of that thinking, you must have forgot you have to press the shift key before to make a, in a way you can understand, big letter.   To answer your question, piss infected mongolian whoremonkey is the best I can do. "Why name calling?" Because it is funnier that way. "Is it some superiority complex or have you just not moved passed the middle school mentality?" Yes it is a superiority complex and yes I have moved passed the middle school mentality. In my middle school days, I would have came back with your all too common cliches. Did you have to look it up? Or did you figure it out all by yourself? If I looked it up, I would have used addle-pate, dullard, dumb cluck, dunderhead, ignoramus, lunkhead, schnook, or simp.  There are all my replies. Now let the flame wars ensue.
