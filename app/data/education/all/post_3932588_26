Thanks to everyone for their fundraising efforts to-date!   We have collected and sent a total of $1,195 to NEADS to-date.   I have also received $358 in cash toward airfare for Nancy and her assistant Michael to travel from Boston. I need approximately $200 more in cash to cover both tickets. If anyone can contribute toward this that would be great!  I would like to encourage you to keep sending the fundraising appeal out and to share with family, friends and collegues about what you are doing to keep the funds rolling!    Remember that our goal is to complete fundraising by August 30th.    Let me, Wendy or Debra know if you need support in this area.  As a reminder, please turn in your donations to me on Sunday. It would be best to put your name on a note on the check so I can credit you with the collection.   You guys are terrific!   MaryKay
