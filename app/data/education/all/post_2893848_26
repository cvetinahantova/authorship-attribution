Buried in a comments strain, Chang asked: "Where is everybody?  What's everyone doing for the Fourth?"  Sorry, Chang, for the pitiful job at paraphrase.    Well, I wonder, too.  And I'm sure others are curious, so I'm giving the matter its own post with its own comments and saying, "Thanks, Chang, for the great idea."  I'm still in IC with Kristin Hall-soon-to-be-Gilchrist-if-I-play-my-cards-right.  We decided to stay at least another six months but probably a year in order to be married without the stress of new jobs in a new town and etc.  No date yet for the wedding as we must wait for a pastoral change at St. Patrick's.  We're both working for local test scoring syndicates.  I'm blogging, cooking, gardening, reading, and even writing a little.  For the 4th, I'm attending my cousin's wedding in Cedar Rapids.  We had a bachelor party for him on Saturday from which I fully recovered this morning (Tuesday).  Kristin is running in the Alliant Energy 8K Very Early Morning Race before the wedding.  Anyone interested in running or spectating should drop me a line.  There.  My update complete, may we hear from the rest of yous?
