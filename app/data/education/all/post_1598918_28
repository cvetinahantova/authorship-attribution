urlLink The Chronicle: 3/5/2004: Recipe for an Affordable Supercomputer: Take 1,100 Apples ... ,  by: Hassan Aref, dean of the College of Engineering and professor of engineering science and mechanics at Virginia Tech.  You probably can't get to this link without a subscription to the Chronicle of Higher Education.  In print the article is from the issue dated March 5, 2004, Section: The Chronicle Review Volume 50, Issue 26, Page B14.  The article is worth reading.  It confronts us with important pilosophical as well as practical considerstions for our species in the future vis a vis computers.  Its probably plaguristic to chain quotes together with no ellipeses to show lack of context but I've done it anyway to share what I think are the most interesting points of the article.  No. 3 on the list (of the fastest computers in the world) is Virginia Tech X which is a cluster of 1,100 Apple G5 desktop computers.  It follows that any institution or company that can afford to set aside 1,000 desktop machines, and to invest in the communications software to link them, can own a supercomputer.  As we construct machines that rival the mental capability of humans, will our analytical skills atrophy? Will we come to rely too much on the ability to do brute-force simulations in a very short time, rather than subject problems to careful analysis? Will we run to the computer before thinking a problem through?  Humans have had centuries to come to grips with machines that outperform us in physical endeavors. A major challenge for the future of humanity is whether we can also learn to master machines that outperform us mentally. One day a supercomputer will mean a computer with superhuman intelligence.
