Well since Dave didn't have anything for today I will fill in. I teach in the classroom next door to Dave. My class is the loud, door slamming, wall pounding, screaming neighbor who disrtacts his class. But today was different, four students were asleep, two were out of class and two were actualy working. Sleeping bothers me more then the screaming and yelling of a normal day. Atleast if students are awake they can be engaged with. I have been told that sleeping is an acceptable coping skill, I am having some trouble dealing with that. It is hard for me to accept that education is a secondary goal for this school. My time is put into getting information ready to bring to the class. I have to figure out how to catch their attention while still meeting IEP goals. At the same time I am supposed to be covering 7th,8th and 9th grade concepts that I have to present at a third  or fourth grade reading level. It is not for the value of my time that I worry but to me  behavior modification and education are equal. I don't understand how one can be sucessful without the other. If a student can leave the school because of successful behavior but far behind accademically isn't that a set up? Well finaly time to go home.  I think that I will use the sleeping skill at the next staff meeting and see how well it is accepted. -Marilyn
