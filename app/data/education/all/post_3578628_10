Hahahahaha... LMAO hehehehehehe... I get it.  You guys don't think I am serious.  I post a movie idea and way for EVERYONE to get together and no one pays any attention.  I give three ways to reach me and NO ONE CARES.  I've had zero responses.  How many?  This isn't some message from your mom to clean your bedroom... or a complaint from your principal to call him doctor.  This is an attempt for a get together with EVERYBODY...    Ok you still think I am kidding?  Inside information.... I am right now working on a large party from like 6:30 to 10:30 tommorow night... Tuesday Night.  Then Spider Man 2 sometime Wednesday.  You all are welcome anytime.  Working on these plans though and so I'll have to post more details later.  But YOU ALL ARE INVITED.   Hey...whose invited?  EVERYONE  Okay so if you (i'm talking to you) want to come post something...like a comment or a post... And/or let someone know (TALK TO ME) Looking forward to havin this so I'm gonna go try to work it out.   But in the future, when I ask people to let me know what they think of seeing a movie like I did with the Spider Man 2, let me know please.  Later.
