"When things go wrong as they sometime will, don't quit!" this is a famous line in the DESIDERATA. To encourage us as we journey in an uphill place. It lets us venture into the realm of patience and perseverance. Because most of the time we quit when we are almost there...when the dawn has almost pass and the sun started to shine...but that is the darkest hour of the night when its almost dawn yet a very thin line to welcoming a new day full of light and life! Why am I saying all these, why do i go into encouraging myself to continue? to never give up? Is it because I feel so alone now, so sad? Perhaps yes. Because I am becoming tired, I am becoming hopeless.... but not really. I don't know I just hated myself for trying to confuse my own self. Just let me be...  I thank God!  Jo
