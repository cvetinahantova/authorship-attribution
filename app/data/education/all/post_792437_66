Just when you thought it was over...    Â  So I'm back, and thank goodness that I am not sick as I was the last time I came back from Pakistan! But since I didn't get much of any stomach illness, I suppose my immune department had to do something to annoy me. So heck with it, I did have a cold twice this time in Pakistan. and just when I thought it was over, I come back and I start coughing and have a sore throat. I took some pain killers to make the throat ache go away and it did. Mmm....I think I got happy too soon, since two days after that third stupid cold like whatever went away, I have now contracted something else..yes yes Cold #4!! this one sucks..as some stupid muscle or something is inflamed in my mouth..down to my throat and it hurts!!! Yes, I'm on more pain killers..to get over it! I called the nurses hotline and they said that I indeed have contracted yet another viral infection and that I should just wait another two weeks (max) to get over it..wopee..JUST what I needed....I almost want to say I wish I'd rather be puking...but I won't..cause those suck just as much..if not more! K..I rattled enough..  On a brighter note...nah I mean dimmer note cause this ain't any brighter.....I'm working on my thesis these days....a very tedious and boring process I must admit. I have to read too much and written very little....Just wish I finish this thinger and graduate soon enough.......
