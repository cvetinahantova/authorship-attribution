I realize today that there are many nice things in Bakersfield; lots of trees, good parks, the marketplace, occasional Farmers Markets, and my side of town (the good part). Today, people and organizations who have made Bakersfield beautiful will be honored in a ceremony tonight. These people earned the possibility to possibly recieve an award based on thier achievements. This morning, my mother and myself helped set up boards illustrating said achievements (Mom's on the advisory board). It will be televised live tonight on chammel 17, NBC. My parents are attending. My big brother and I will be eating pizza, and Sol will be at home sleeping. Have a great night!
