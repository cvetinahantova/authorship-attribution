Here's the Alter Piece from Connect last month; I blogged about it then.  I love the symbolism of it and the way it plays with the idea of communion.  What's great about connect is the way its different people doing it each month, it gives it a different flavour and expression of Church.  I think its Inspire tonight and as its leant I'm sure it'll be interesting.
