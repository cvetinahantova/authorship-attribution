So as of today I've offically been away from Korea a month.  I can't say I really miss it that much.  There are things I miss though.  I miss the social aspects, the girlfriend and circel of friends.  And I miss knowing where everything is and having my own room night after night.  But it'll all be there when I get back (at least I hope so).  Today the bus ride I was worried about really wasn't all that bad.  I've gone crazy reading lately and read most of the way here.  I finished "What color is your parachute."  Great great book.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a job.  I also picked up a knock off copy of a Dhali Lama book called, shit I can't remember.  Anyway it deals with finding happiness and how he thinks this is possible and whatnot.  I'm not blown away by it but it's good.  It was co-written my a shrink and there is too much of him and not enough of the DL in my opinion.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  I have to say Vietnam is a stunningly beautiful country.  It really sunk in on the way here.  Everything is so green and vibrant.   The city I'm right now is rather small but seems quite nice.  I should be meeting some girls I met on the bus for drinks in like 30 minutes or so.  This will beat a Saturday night of sitting in my room.  I think I'll take a small tour tomorrow and then go shopping.  This place is famous for making clothes at cheap prices.  One lady quoted $25 for a custom made suit.  I'll have to look into that.   Yahoo is giving me problems with mail.  What a pain in the ass.
