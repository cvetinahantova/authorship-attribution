urlLink (IBERRY)  Or, otherwise known as The Higher Education Links List (HELL).  It includes annotated links to education courseware and resources relating to higher education as well as other education topics including humor and job openings. The site is well organized and it is easy to navigate among the different categories.  In particular, I liked the list of student plagiarism paper mills.
