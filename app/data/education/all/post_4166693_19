I had a conversation with a friend the other day where she really bashed blogging. She thinks it's a stupid thing to do because it allows people to psuedo-stalk other people. Her reasoning makes sense, I guess, since people can read what you write and never post. However, when you write it you know people are going to read it that you don't necessarily know, so it's really more about publishing your words without the copyright. You want people to read about your life if you post. Or you want to let specific people read about your life, at least. Either way, it's like a diary that you can share without fear of retaliation or mockery. It's something I sort of have come to enjoy.  I know that she is bitter because of personal reasons which incorporate blogging but aren't necessarily typical of it. However, I found it somewhat offensive that she insinuated that all people who blog are stalkers. I'm not stalking anyone! Besides, the people that I communicate through the writing I do here have all had wonderful things to say. I enjoy their comments and their insights. I appreciate that they communicate back to me. It's fun. And, let's face it, one of them makes my friend light up like I've never seen before, so that's just phenomenal.  Blah to being negative....
