For now I think that I will utilize Life with Christ for a Jesus Connect Ministries Blog ONLY.  I will do that for exposure to the christian community there.  Hopefully some of those folks will check out what we are doing on our website and participate.    Until then I will do the personal weblog on Blogspot and Jesus Connect there.  Who knows, I might play with having multiple blogs on blogger.com instead.  Hopefully it will be a bit more seamless and less of a hassle.  I certainly appreciate all of the hard work and effort that Jeremy has put in to that website for Christians to use.
