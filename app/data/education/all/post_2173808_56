If you needed evidence of Bush's ability to move to the middle early in campaign, Bush's announcement yesterday on illegal aliens provided it.  It was clearly intended to bolster support among Hispanics and he did it despite the complaints of many conservatives.  The Democrats have yet to show up at the Iowa caucuses and Bush is already starting to troll for swing voters.
