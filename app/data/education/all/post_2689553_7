Im not really writing anything of value in here, just something so that I can be seen as an "active" Blogger user, so that I'll get invited to use GMail.  Hopefully, they won't read into my plan...which...wouldn't be too hard.  I just announced it.  Anyway, I suppose I should talk about something relevant.  Um...Well, its finals week, I guess.  And...um...that really sucks.  Oh, yeah, and for marching band Im gonna start playing the baritone...its kind of a small tuba.  Well, not much else to talk about...thats pretty much it.
