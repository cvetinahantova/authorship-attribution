This is my first posting and let's see if I can make it fine.    HI!  My name is Melissa but most call me Mel.  I'm 25 and have been going to college so long they should pay me.  I have three dogs because I seemed to have over done it since my former dog died.  This blog I created because so many of you out there have said I should put my thoughts in writing, well, here I am.  My first thought?  Kirste Alley gained all this weight so she can have a show to lose it.  My other thought?  Kerry should not be President, Edwards should.  Kerry is too boring and his face looks like it's going to run.  I don't know if I want to stare at that for four years.  Bush?  HA!  Four more years of that and I really will go into a coma.  I had a breakdown the first time he was elected.  Last week I heard from someone that the world is a narrow-minded place.  I felt like screaming it isn't, it's just that too many are self-absorbed and too much in a hurray to enjoy and understand.  I think that's it for today.  Join me tomorrow for another adventure.
