All right, I'm in the middle of making some aesthetic changes here.  This means, among other things, that we will be dispensing with the alteregos.  Sorry, Scott.    I don't know shit about coding, so if any kind souls who do want to make suggestions for how to make this look better, please let me know.    I'm going to add some links.  Suggestions are welcome.  Does anyone want to design me a better banner?  As long as it says "Impeccable Jones" and rocks, it should do.
