"Death was the gateway to possibilities.... "Why did God rest on the seventh day?" "I suppose He was a bit flaked out after six days' hard work", I answered. "He didn't rest because He was tired though." "Oh - didn't He? It makes me tired just to think about it all." "Course He didn't. He wasn't tired." "Wasn't He?" "No - He made rest." "Oh. He did that, did He?" "Yes, thats the biggest miracle. Rest is. What do you think it was like before Mister God started on the first day?" "A perishing big muddle, I guess, " I replied. "Yes, and you can't rest when everything is in a big muddle, can you?" "I suppose not. So what then?" "Well, when He started to make all the things, it got a bit less muddly." "Makes sense, " I nodded. "When He was finished making all the things, Mister God had undone all the muddle. Then you can rest, so that's why rest is the very,very biggest miracle of all. Don't you see?"  ...........  "Being dead is a rest. Bring dead, you can look back and get it all straight before you go on."  Being dead was nothing to get fussed about. Dying could be a bit of a problem, but not if you had really lived. Dying needed a certain amount of preparation and the only preparation for dying was real living, the kind of preparation old Granny Harding had made during her lifetime...Granny Harding was glad to die; not because life had been too hard for her, but because she had been glad to live. She was glad that rest was near, not because she had been overworked but because she wanted to order, wanted to arrange, ninety-three years of beautiful living, she wanted to play it all over again.  ~ "Mister God, this is Anna" by Fynn
