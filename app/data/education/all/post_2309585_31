I've decided one thing I really really hate about college-- chatty bottle-job blondes who don't know when to shut up and show a little respect now and then. For example-- today, as part of the campus-wide "Month of Prayer," they had the Benson Auditoruim open from 7 to 8:50 so that people could have a quiet place to pray and reflect without being disturbed. So, around 8:20 or so, I go, figuring I've got about 30 minutes to collect my thoughts and have some meditation time. No. In come these bimbos, talking LOUDLY about stupid junk, like, "Ewww...is she really going out with him? and "Oh, I, like, soooo failed that test today!" No amount of throat clearing or glaring would shut them up. I was so close to giving them a piece of my mind, especially as there were several people around me who were really into their prayers that morning, when the bell rang for chapel. Grrr...  Or take yesterday morning, for example. We had a song service for yesterday's chapel, which these two bottle-jobs talked through. I mean, I barely saw them stop for air. When they got loud, I'd sing louder, which would quiet them down for about ten seconds. Then we learned this morning that those songs were being recorded by request of Searcy area soldiers who are currently in Iraq. Way to ruin a beautiful thing, bimbos.  So, all I'm saying is, if you're one of those people, stop it before I kill you, or beat you until my arm hurts. Oh, and if your roots extend almost all the way down to your ears, we can tell you're not a natural blonde.
