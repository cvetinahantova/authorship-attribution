urlLink Normalizing Data Transformations. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Jason Osborne.  It deals with the application of a mathematical modification to the values of a variable.   From the ERIC Digest:  Data transformations are the application of a mathematical modification to the values of a variable. There are a great variety of possible data transformations, from adding constants to multiplying, squaring, or raising to a power, converting to logarithmic scales, inverting and reflecting, taking the square root of the values, and even applying trigonometric transformations such as sine wave transformations.   The goal of this Digest is to present some of the issues involved in data transformation, with particular focus on the use of data transformation for normalization of variables. The Digest is intended to serve as an aid to researchers who do not have extensive mathematical backgrounds or who have not had extensive exposure to this issue. It will focus on three of the most common data transformations utilized for improving normality as discussed in texts and the literature: square root, logarithmic, and inverse transformations. Readers looking for more information on data transformations might refer to Hartwig and Dearing (1979) or Micceri (1989).
