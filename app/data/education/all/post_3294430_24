i had comments from fellow kendokas from around the world. they gave me some ggod advice about how to cope with practicing suburi in low ceiling conditions. if not a shinai would have been sacrificed to a saw. thanks a million. we practised our fundamentals today. i enjoyed myself becauase training was hard. my kiai personally has also improved. i really think the way of the living sword is for me. with all this hardship, we learn humility, friendship, honor and most important respect for others and oneself. i will give it my all and not look back.
