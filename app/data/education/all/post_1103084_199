Early this morning (6;30ish a.m.)Jaelyn woke up.  The following is her co-authored account of the events leading up to her early rise:   Jaelyn dreamed that when she was little and she was playing in a big dollhouse with Emily Livermore â€“ they were playing INSIDE the dollhouse, and all of the sudden, there were big scary things outside of the dollhouse.  And all of the sudden, Daddy came up to the dollhouse and he was kind of scary because  his hands had turned RED like a monster.  So she woke up and called for her Dadddy.  Who came running up the stairs, and she burrowed out of her big yellow quilt and threw her arm backwards and up over the neck of her Daddy and pulled him close.    The End.
