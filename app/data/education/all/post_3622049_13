I have been obsessing about sex all week.  Damn am I in need.  It's been over a year and a half since the last time and my next prospective isn't until maybe September.  When you get it all the time you don't know how bad it is to want it.  When your a virgin you don't know what your missing.  So all I can think about is how much I want.   I don't know what else to say.  All I'm thinking about is sex.
