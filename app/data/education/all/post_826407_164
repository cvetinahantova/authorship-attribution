The reason for the 2 weeks silence?  Reports.  7 class sets to prepare, all finally done and handed in today.   A great weight is lifted off and now I have time for exciting stuff like blogging etc.  Except that it might remain quiet for a week more because we're off to Rome on mission (hooray).  We are staying with Marco and Cinzia.  I'm very excited.
