So pretty much just having a boring day. Trying to get things organized for August and I've suddnely realized that there isn't going to be enough time or money to get ready the way I want to. I'm downd to three unplanned weeks this summer, which yes I know all you corporate types think is more than any human deserves, but to a TEACHER this seems life a short amount of time. Right now the big toss-up in life is whether I should teach summer school or not. Comments? Suggestions? You jsut let me know.
