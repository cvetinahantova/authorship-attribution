BLUE NILE   finally  has a new CD ready! It's been  ten years  since the last.  The new one is called  High  and is due out on August 30 on Sanctuary Records. Read a Scottish newspaper article about it  urlLink here . If you don't know Blue Nile, do your  urlLink research .   ALISON MOYET  is also releasing a new CD called  Voice  in September, on Sanctuary Records, which my doppleganger must be running! I suspect it will be a stringy CD because it's being produced by Anne Dudley, who has done strings for  everyone . This record mixes oldies (including "Cry Me A River" and recent Bacharach/Costello song "God Give Me Strength") with new songs. Her last record was her first in like 10 years and was really lovely.  urlLink A good fansite .    PAUL WELLER  has a new single in August that's a cover of "Wishing On A Star" by Rose Royce. It's form his new covers CD called  Studio 150 .  His  urlLink new website  is clunky, FYI.   ERASURE  (this is for Jason!) have a new CD called   urlLink Nightbird   (hello Stevie Nicks) and a new single called "Breathe" (haven't they already released a single called "Breathe"? Doesn't everyone at some point?). Anyhoo, the whole shebang has been delayed until January 2005.   I guess I should note that  DURAN DURAN   finally  signed with Epic (not Sanctuary, who are wise to avoid this money pit). They trashed much of what they had been working on and are now working with Rich Harrison and Dallas Austin, which means this new record (due in October?) may be a  pukey hiphop record .  Attempts toward the trendy will  fail , old men.
