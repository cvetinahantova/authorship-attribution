I am working right now on a freelance editing/research job based on the  urlLink Scopes Monkey Trial .  It is extremely interesting and challenging - challenging for my own beliefs and life.  The trial was a famous trial that took place in the 1920's, and was pretty much a debate between conservative Christians and evolutionists.  John Scopes was tried for teaching evolution in a school, which at the time was illegal.  There's a whole lot more to it than that though.  Inherit the Wind is the famous movie that was made based on the trial, but there are a lot of facts that have been twisted and it's not completely accurate.  I am reading through the actual transcript of the trial and doing some research within that.  It is causing me to really scrutizine certain passages in the Bible and interpret these for myself.  Example: The Creation Story, Joshua's Battle (where the sun stands still), The Tower of Babble, The Flood, etc.   I have always known of these stories but never taken everything literally.  Like creation - I always thought the seven days represented periods of time, not actual days.  But there's a lot I'm finding out that may be causing me to re-evaluate my beliefs, or at least search deeper.   Now if only I had time to learn Hebrew and Greek.
