urlLink Studying Watersheds: A Confluence of Important Ideas. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury.  From the ERIC Digest:  "How is life in your watershed? Though we generally describe where we live in terms of towns, cities, or school districts, we also live within the boundaries of local watersheds. Determined by the topography of a region rather than political boundaries, watersheds are areas of land defined by the flow patterns of rainwater or melting snow and ice. In general terms a watershed is a geographic area where all the water, sediments, and dissolved materials drain to a common outlet-a stream, river system, reservoir, underground aquifer, or other body of water. It can also be thought of as an area that "catches" water and routes it to a common basin, channel, or network of channels. Internationally, the term catchment rather than watershed is used to convey this idea.   Some watersheds are complex systems like the Everglades (Robinson, Robinson, & Lane; 1996), while others are simpler river systems. Together they supply the world's fresh water. Understanding these natural systems and sustaining environmentally healthy conditions within these systems require the application of knowledge and skills from many subject domains, as well as active inquiry, collaborative study, and decision making. Unfortunately, most Americans do not know what watersheds are, and only 22% know that storm water runoff is the most common source of pollution in streams, rivers, and oceans (NEET, 1999).
