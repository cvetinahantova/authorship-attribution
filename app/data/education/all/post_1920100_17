THE WEEKEND     Friday:  I went to work in a fist grade classroom. It was a good day. Kids are so sweet at the end of the day some girl hands me a heart she had cut out out of her bookmark and says, "this is for you teacher you are nice" eventhough it was a small gesture it was very sweet and I felt appreciated.    Saturday:  I went to a baby shower 10am-12pm It was great time of women fellowship. I then went to my house because we were having a carne asada for my dad since his birthday was Sunday. I can't believe he is 60 years old. I pray that God continue blessing him and keeps him healthy and gives him many more years. Next, I went over to Sergio's house to go say bye to his sister. I had a lot of fun with her and it was really nice to get to know her and her son. I hope they enjoyed my company too.    Sunday:  Went to church and went with some friends to lunch. Later I went over to Celena's house as we waited for care group. Didn't want to drive home and be back in a couple of hours so I hung out there. I went to Target and guess what I got a price adjustment. I had bought a DVD player last Wednesday and when I went to Target Sunday it was 10 bucks less. That is cool.   I feel God has been doing amazing things these last couple days. I just want to continue drawing near to God and learning about his grace and love for us. Keep me in prayer. I am also praying for those of you I love.
