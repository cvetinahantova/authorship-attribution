Must military intervention destabilize world politics?  We think not.  Strategy depends on collecting models of how the world works.  Yet modeling itself always reduces the facts.  Importantly, enthuasiasm for models can sweep planners away from other details - for instance, it seemed to many people that an entry into Iraq would be clean and surgical because of our overwhelming advantages, while in reality Iraq merely opened a Pandora's box of cultural reactions that we have no models for.  IQ for hire intends to be the voice that says, Hey, there's no culture in your model.
