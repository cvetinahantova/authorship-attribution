A productive uneventful week   Yes, we've been very productive at work this week. We probably got more done since Monday than in the two months before that. The only catch is that we did that during the first half of the week, and now we're sleeping on the laurels. As my history teacher from high school used to say, "Hazte la fama y echate a dormir".
