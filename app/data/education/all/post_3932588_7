The 5  urlLink heart rate monitors  donated by the generous folks at Sports Instruments have arrived.  If you (like me) are interested in cool toys... If you (like me) don't know your body's limits very well yet... If you (like me) want to make the most of this training program... If you (like me) place huge importance on stylish fashion accessories...     ...then you should contact me to check out my Sports Instruments Fit 2 heart rate monitor or buy one of the 5 from the team.  I'd be happy to show off mine (which came yesterday) or answer any questions. I'm pleased with mine after playing for a day, though our first run together will be tonight after it cools off.  Carol, if you're still interested, please let me know how and when I can get you one. Everybody else: email me if you're interested, and remember that the $80 price of the monitor goes straight to the team and your fundraising goal. Awesome.
