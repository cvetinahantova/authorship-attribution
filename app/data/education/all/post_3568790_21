Time for another bloggie check in.  More folks retiring from work here - this year will be really interesting with all of the changes.  Next year will be, too, with all the new hirees...    I hope the girls make it home ok - their mom is getting a late start and she was dreading the flight(s) across the country.  Time to go to town and get ready for their arrival - shopping, cleaning, napping, etc.
