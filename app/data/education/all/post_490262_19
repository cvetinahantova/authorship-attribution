My class is taking a standardized test of basic skills this week.  It has to be the most boring thing we do.  However, it gives me a chance to observe the kids without them realizing it.  They do some weird things.  I will never understand why third graders are so enamored of pencil shavings.  Yes, that's right.  Pencil shavings.  They try to see how long they can make them with out breaking them.  They keep them in plastic baggies in their desks (which I admit is better than on the floor).  Several of them are playing with them right now.
