hello,  how is everyone?  i'm doing good just chillin at work.  i only have three  classes today so i have lots of time to do internet research.  well actually  right now i'm just instant messaging with friends in the states, but i do  intend to get started on work stuff soon.  i need to find good learning  games and activities for the kids.  i'm still figuring out their level so  it's a bit difficult.  i went to dinner last night with a girl from england named emma.  she's lots  of fun to hang around and is always using funny english expressions i've  never heard.  she's been traveling for almost a year all over the world.   it's great to hear her stories about the different places she has been.   india, nepal, cambodia, vietnam, australia, and laos are just some of the  places she has been.  wow.  it makes me so jealous i want to see all these  places too.  i think the travel bug bit me over here.  well i've gotta run.  hope everyone is enjoying their summer  jane  _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar Â get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/
