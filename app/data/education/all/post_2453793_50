i feel like people are keeping secrets from me.  people talk badly about me behind my back.  someone doesn't trust me.  people assume i'm doing things that i'm not.  it's cloudy out.  i believe and trust someone who has only told me lies.  someone leads me on.  i get bored with all of my music.  people make me feel like crap.  i get in a fight with my parents.  people only remember the bad things about me.  people don't believe me.  others answer for me because they  think  they know me well enough.  i lose a good friend.  i'm lonely.  it's spring but there's still snow on the ground and it takes forever to melt.  i take things for granted.  there's no hot water left to take a shower with.  my friends start dating someone and completely forget that i exist.  my friends start dating someone and start being total assholes because they see me as a threat.  i fall asleep with my contacts in.  i get sick.  i take online quizzes next to someone and they disagree with the answers i put and think i'm lying because they think they know what i think and feel.  people whisper around me.  there's nothing good on the radio.  i get in an argument with someone.  i feel like no one understands me at all.  i misplace something i need.  my room is messy and i'm super disorganized.  it's too cold to sleep.  people accuse me of things that they do.  i'm emotional.  there's nothing to do.  i'm away from my sister.  plants die.  my beliefs are attacked.  i lose sight of my values and everything seems to lose meaning.  someone takes my picture.   i share too much with someone because i'm naive and don't realize that i'm just an object to them.
