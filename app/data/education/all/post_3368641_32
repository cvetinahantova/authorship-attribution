Zoom  Seeing the decay of my untapped wonder frightened me worse than any fiction.  When the ambitious addictions wear off and you wake up to the decades in blur, you get a brief moment between taking another hit of the bullshit trip, or fighting the undertow, by seeing for yourself if what you are made of is the open road of change.  And I said zoom, and gave up my ghosts for the road that was paved with progressive intentions.   Â©2003 DC Vision
