well, that in a second.  first some snow commentary.  36 hours straight of snow, piling up to 10 inches in my part of jersey -- absolutely insane!  makes for driving taking 3 to 4 times the usual amount of time (30 minutes to campus instead of 10, 2.5 hours to get to walmart and back yesterday w/ scott which is normally 15 minutes each way)... nuts!  but i love it!  can't wait til i get pictures back from all this mess... snow is one thing... starting out w/ the first sticking snow of the season being this huge, that's juts plain freakin awesome!  and now... my day without verbs... see if you can pick out which items to ask me about for the most entertaining stories... & enjoy =P  awake, breakfast, crazy snow, car, errands, train, new york, zanzibar, mango margarita, trek, slush, "free" hat, indian chant, rockefeller center, sparkly tree, pictures, taxi, race, slush, broadway, 42nd street, balcony, tap-dancers, encore, slush, penn station, train, car, people, monsters inc, brownies, duuuuuuude
