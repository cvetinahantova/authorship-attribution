it's gonna be a lonely, lonely, lonely,  lonely day.. phantom planet's song, ringing through my head..  enjoyed my day, at the beach yesterday. but, it wasn't perfect, my sayang wasn't there.. all the time, Incubus', I Wish You Were Here, was playing in my mind...  ___________________________________ Wish You Were Here  I dig my toes into the sand The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket I lean against the wind Pretend that I am weightless And in this moment I am happy...happy  I wish you were here  I lay my head into the sand The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it I'm counting UFO's I signal them with my lighter And in this moment I am happy...happy  I wish you were here ___________________________________  here's one of my own:-  If only i could, I would hold you by the shores, And share the same air that blows..  If only i could, I would walk with you on the sands, And have your hand in mine..  If only i could, I would face the seas with you, And wrap my hands round your waist..  If only i could, I would sit you on the rocks, And feel your legs against mine..  If only i could, I would.. (",) ___________________________________  really wished my sayang, shazleen, was there at that moment of time.. her call made my day, and her msg that night, felt so beautiful.. "you are my one and only"
