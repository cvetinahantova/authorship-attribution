As I read the  urlLink blog  suggested by  urlLink Nirmalya , I learnt the term 'Quarter-life crisis'. It reminded me the counselling sessions I had when I was in the university.   Once I started my university studies, I felt like my old world was breaking. I thought once I entered the university, the goal was not far. Sorry lady, it's a start rather than an end. I could only say Thank you very much to the ones who told me my goal was not far, when I am dealing with my problems behind the door secretly ......  I was so fed up by myself to the extent that I blamed myself for everything. From my own poor grade to my tuition students' poor grade. I thought I were Jesus Christ :P. Thus I went to see the free counselling service of the university. I realized my problems, confessed to myself, accepted them and faced them directly. It sounded like cliche but it worked on me.  I hope that this remark helps.
