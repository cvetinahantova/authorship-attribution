I'm trying really hard not to be crabby today.  I didn't want to come to work. It's a gorgeous day outside and work is really not fun right now. We're in the middle of getting ready for new students which means trying to figure out where they think they're living in two weeks--on campus or off--and how we're going to get them all the information that they need and just tons and tons of important but annoying things. I'm glad that they're coming, but could they just let me know in writing where they're planning to live? And top onto that all the stuff that I'm doing for Institutional Research, which really isn't much, but it's time consuming and really confusing.  So, all in all, I'd have much rather stayed home and done yard work.    "Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."     ~1 Cor 10:31
