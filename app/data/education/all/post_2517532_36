After reading   urlLink Balbonics  ' and   urlLink Dominattyrix  's posts on the cute avatar/icons that anyone can create at   urlLink this site  , I also thought of creating MY avatar/icon.Â  And, here is what I came up with.      My friend (JanJan) and I both think this is how I look like.  Okay, okay... I look like a  happy cancer patient , but I think people who really know me and who've seen me will agree that I look like the icon.  After all, I hardly ever go out without my veil.  And, of course, you can NOT not notice how my icon self is wearing a pink shirt/sweater and a pink scarf.  Oh, and the background (which is partly hidden) is the gate of the  Sensoji (Asakusa Kannon Temple)  in  Tokyo , where I actually posed in and had my photo taken almost four years ago.:)  And, who's that little cute fellow in my hands?  That's Shan Cai, my aunt's cute spoiled brat of a cat!  Here's another look at her.:)    This one doesn't know she's a cat!  Tihihihi!:)
