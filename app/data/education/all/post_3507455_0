Is this really any different? Besides, we don't get the fun little icons of how we're feeling. I feel like a smiley face drinking a fruity blender drink. I love the day off, I have never smelled so much lighter fluid in my life. I feel like I must eat grilled meat today. yet I have no grill.   Jobs are a tricky thing. I'm scared to start a new job, but I know I must, and that requires obtaining a new job. So I must make a new resume and write letters. I hate this whole process. I want the big texan in the white hat to come and say "Hey there, tall drink of water, want a lucrative job where you do very little and get paid a lot? I'll relocate you to a non-dying area and you'll be swamped with money and broads!"   And I'd say "Boards? Why do I need boards?"  And he'd say, "No, broads."  And I'd say, "I'd rather have mamasitas thank you very much, especially if I'm going to Texas."  and he'd look all stern and then smile and go,"Well, that's settled. See ya Monday!"     THAT'S how I should get a job!
