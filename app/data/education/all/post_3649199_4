First off, i'd like to say hello to everyone who is reading this atempt at anger management through verbal execution through the execution of electronic prose. Ah, technology. while I acknoweldge that the wealth of people that will be reading this are aqauintances/friends/rivals/enemies/trust-fund conservatives (Yes! they do exist!)/penguin obsessers, i urge you to forward the link....http://scamelo.blogspot.com...if you find any of this desirable or high quality reading. First off, the title: Bias-has nothing to do with the unfortunate Len Bias , the great basketball player for te Terps of UMd in the mid-80s, but NBA/NHL/MLB/NFL/Xtreme ping-pong bias. Second, Bagels aren't really part of this equation, they're simply a hopeful use for alliteration. Thrid...basketball is interchangeable with:Xbox, football, soccer, baseball, new hollywood fad dodgeball, ice cream, my romantical ineptitude, oscure collectible toys made only in the state of Nevada, and pop art criticism. just kidding about the pop art.                 Basketball            IMO, the NBA (David Stern, particularly) hasa fixation with the Lakers. Then again, this the opinion of many people who consider themselves sports pundits or a variation of that. But it's not the fact that the Lakers don't have their reasons for popularity or reasons to drive up last years dismal ratings:they have first name recognition:Phil(!), Kobe, Shaq/thebigAristotle/diesel, Gp/Glove, Mailman, Medvedenko. But their counterparts in the Finals(DET)also have first name recognition:Rip, Tayshaun, Big Ben, Darko(!), Rasheed-or as he's been known, Tech. But the Lakers have had everything...more tomorrow.
