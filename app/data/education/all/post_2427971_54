Busy summer once again, or at least the first half. I don't want to do anything but hang out in Bend for the last half of the summer, just want to hang out with friends, really don't want to go anywhere at all this summer. I've got the LAN on the last day of school, that will be really fun i know. Then family raft trip on the Dschutes on Sunday going 'til Wednesday, so it'll be get in and out to Nates on that day. Will hang at Nates from then to the 26th-27th, depending on his mother. If it ends up being the 27th we'll go to LPNW which will obviously kick ass, can't wait to just get up there with 'im and game! After that I'll head to Portland apparently and go to my dads from there... Don't really understand that, I'll have to fix it. I'll be at my dad's for a month working and taking Drivers Ed *sigh*, Stupid... Save up for car insurence and a nice airsoft gun I think, then the rest in savings if there's any left(which there should be by the time I'm done working). When I get back I really hope there's nothing else planned that I don't know about, staying in Bend sounds good to me. I'll be set when all this stuff has passed, summer will be nice... I hope.
