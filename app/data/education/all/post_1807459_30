The date went well in that I had a good time.  But I couldn't be more different from this girl if I tried.  Her English was really good I'll say that.  She is as close to a Korean hippie as I have ever seen.  I project 0 future.  Oh well I'll live.  There is a possibility that some people have wondered onto my page that I had not intended to read my page.  Again, oh well.  As is turns out my site is linked to Asma's, which has turned out to be more popular than first imagined, in that everyone in the dorms reads it.  I  got a good laugh out of hearing this.  I ate lunch downtown with a teacher I used to work with.  She is really cool and we had a good time.  Pizza Hut seems to be the tradition and again we ate there today.  I'm really tired.  I've been trying to go to bed early but all attempts have failed.  I fucking lost my hat in the market and now I need to get another.  FUCK!  I really liked that hat.  Again oh well.  I'll survive, at least until I can get another hat.  I have to speak on Thursday and still haven't bothered putting together my hand out.  I might do that tomorrow.  I only have to talk about games I play in class so that shouldn't be hard.  I'm going to bed.
