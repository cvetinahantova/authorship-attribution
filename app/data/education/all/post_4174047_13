urlLink     A few more pics of the pad...My place is situated in a place called an OfficeTel. Which basically mean there are some rooms occupied by businesses and some used for living, the latter being the majority. A place like this will vary in price, Seoul being more expensive, but you may get lucky. In Kyunggi province where I live it is still pretty expensive. For those who are thinking of moving to Korea, unless you get housing from your school, which in my opinion is good and bad. I chose to get my own place last year, more out of necessity. As a Gyopo in Korea, we are given or should I say not given the same treatment as a caucasian foreigner. For the most part we do not recieve free housing, and other benefits such as paid return airfare to and from your home country. Now, this doesn't occur %100 of the time but it is definetly true that us Gyopos do not get the same treatment as others. The one advantage we do have is our VISA. We are able to apply for an   urlLink  F-4 visa or Gyopo Visa   . This Visa is a great thing to have as it allows us to teach private lessons legally. The length of sojourn is for 2 years rather than 1, and we are not required to leave the country to renew. Back to housing, it is required for a person to put down Gae Hak Geum (a deposit), usually between   urlLink  5million or 10 million won    (returned to you at the end of your lease). If you can afford more then do so, 'cause the higher the deposit the lower the Wol Sae (monthly rent). If you can afford a really big deposit like, 60million won which is the about the value of a place like mine, then you go into Chun Sae (which means putting the whole value down and the not paying any monthly rent) the owner recieves interest off these big deposits and then returns the money at the end of the lease. I hope this info helps...
