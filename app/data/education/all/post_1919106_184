I've previously praised  urlLink Arjen Anthony Lucassen's  music (including jewels like  Star One ,  Ambeon , and productions for  Lana Lane ), but he's really overdone himself with the new Ayreon disc,  urlLink The Human Equation . Last night  urlLink my favorite radio  played both discs. I was amazed, flabbergasted, blown away.  The Human Equation  is one of those discs that make you want to immediately run off to the store and buy it. Which means that it's on my wishlist now.
