urlLink Curriculum and Assessment in an Age of Computer Algebra Systems. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Michael Meagher.  From the ERIC Digest:  The use of Computer Algebra System (CAS) technology in the teaching of mathematics is entering a new and crucial stage. A considerable amount of work to date has focused on support of existing curriculum topics and existing curriculum models. Kutzler's seminal book on teaching and learning using DERIVE (1996) includes the phrase "here is an example of how CAS can be used to support an existing curriculum topic". Arguments for the use of CAS as an effective tool in supporting teaching and learning of mathematics are well established. Now comes the real work.   Curriculum models and assessment of curriculums are the structures that schools and examining boards create to educate students. The two are deeply connected and the real work of CAS advocates is now to develop curriculum models in which the use of CAS is an integral part, not just of the practice of the curriculum, but, of the conception of the curriculum. A thorough examination of topics must be carried out to decide what really has to stay for conceptual reasons and what is still extant only because of tradition.   A crucial part of this process is a demonstration of assessment using CAS. Unless instruments can be found to measure the achievement, or lack of achievement, of that learning which is possible through the use of CAS it is destined to remain as a prop occasionally brought out to support and bolster existing methods of teaching and learning.
