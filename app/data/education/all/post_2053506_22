Since it's summer here - and getting warmer each and every day. It's getting more difficult to even think about hot tea.  I can tolerate it first thing in the morning, or very late at night.  Like after a shower, when the sun is set, and it feels a little cooler outside.  I need to make myself drink more of it.  I know how good it is, I also know how wonderful it makes me feel. I enjoy having a cuppa and smelling the flavors. With all the swap choices, I also love trying to figure out which one I will have next.  I love doing that.  I think I have an idea, then I come across one I want more.  Having choices is part of the fun of the tea swaps.
