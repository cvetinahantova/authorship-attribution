Recently,  urlLink Zam  had a  urlLink post  that referenced  urlLink Merriam Webster's  top ten list of favorite words.  I have been working on including these words into normal conversation, because I can.  Also, I would like to add how much of a nerd I am, because I actually  wrote these words on to index cards with their definitions .  Yep, that's just me.  The sweet adorable nerd. Okay, fine, just the nerd then.   When I was fighting with my Mom, I never wanted to  urlLink defenestrate  someone that badly before in my life.   After my son was born, I developed a case of  urlLink callipygian .   Are you completely  urlLink discombobulated  yet?   I am often an unusual  urlLink plethora  of knowledge, while being somewhat  urlLink plethoric .   That's right, Plethora has two completely different meanings! I bet you didn't know that. I actually had to look up words for the second definition of plethora.  I feel so smart now.   urlLink Zam  strikes me as a  urlLink flibbertigibbet .   I really liked the movie  urlLink Serendipty .  It was such a sweet movie.   After having a fight, one really looks all  urlLink kerfuffle .   I am not a  urlLink persnickety  person, though I may come off as such at times.   I only watched old Batman shows for the  urlLink onomatopoeia  moments.   This is list is not  urlLink juxtaposed , it is actually the opposite.   There ya go! All ten of Merriam-Webster's favorite words for 2004.  Who knew that flibbertigibbet is really a word that one can use.  I always thought it was just a made up word.   Things that make you say, hmmmmmm.
