the following email is from andrew hamilton...   Gentlemen:  Please excuse any misspellings, exaggerations, or otherwise eccentric behavior.   I am drinking  the whiskey.  First, the Bayou is a Bayou no longer. The mighty magnolia has fallen; no shade falls on the sacred roof; the tender semen smell laces the cool morning air no more; the leaves do not litter the path; possums do not swing, nor waddle, nor twitch; and the landlord's grandmother turns in her grave. Perhaps she waits for the troubadour, Jesse Gloyd, and his promises of evening love for the dead, as strummed on a bandaged guitar.  Or,   Perhaps not.  One thing we know for sure. The Bayou, as we have known it, is gone. Much too much pale light changes the atmosphere; no better, no worse, only changed.  In other news, Iraq has been returned its sovereignty, Michael Moore continues to prove his stupidity on a national scale, and a new Bevmo has officially opened in Pasadena. And yet there remain those who doubt the existence of a God.  Disagreements:  Jesse: In continuation of our real time porch conversation of last night, and picking up the pieces of this virtual one, David Fricke, despite his (what you call) boyish, and (what I call) frighteningly preserved and (ultimately) bizarre looks, is definitely not our generation's Greil Marcus. Greil Marcus is first and foremost a social scientist. He is a semiologist who bridges pop culture and philosophy. He is a connection-maker by trade, signifying the hitherto mundane or merely factual. David Fricke is a music critic, albeit a usually very good one; with the exception of his wasting 5 stars on Adrock and the After School Crew. Greil Marcus on the other hand, is a critical theorist, much like Lester Bangs, Roland Barthes, and David Hickey.   There is, my dear boy, a difference.  Of course, too be fair, the only writings I have read of David Fricke are those in his tiny column in RS. He (usually) has good taste in music. He (according to the blurb in italics, apparently) has been to more shows than I have. I am sure that the 500 words he gets per month are not a qualitative sampling of his thoughts on pop culture as we know it, and, were he to have a few books, or even a longer section, I might change my mind. But, until he convinces me otherwise, I will not hold him as my generation's Greil Marcus. Instead, I pass that mantel on to either Nick Hornby, or Jon Singleton. Whom, come to think of it, are probably closer to Greil Marcus's generation. So, oh well.  On to other thoughts...  Old Music or New Music?  Is there anything worth listening to these days?   Do they make it like they used too?   Can there be such a thing as new music, given the range and subconscious influence of music history?   Considering the existence of the blues, has there ever been any such thing as New Music?   If there is such a thing as New Music, that is, music that has no place, only new, nothing to tether it to the long corridors of tradition and influence, music that uses nothing that anyone has ever used before, if there is this New Music, what does it sound like?        Ok.  Enough.  I am getting a little big for my britches, a little dogmatic.  After all, there is so much goodness to be enjoyed, why question it?   As long as it makes you want to   a) scream b) cry c) smile d) quiver or e) motherfuckingdance!  it's ok with me.  In other  news...  Andy: I continue to pray for you.  Matt: You too.  A & M: Don't get discouraged. No matter how many teenage love handles you see, never forget that while you are being paid (albeit ten dollars a day, or whatever), to travel around the country and play the rock and roll, some other people don't get to do that. Not that some people mind that much. No, but seriously, I can understand why you guys might get discouraged, and I'll be praying for you. That must be draining.  Matt: Is there a concrete plan for your B.P.? If no, do you want there to be? J-Glo and me gots plenty of time on our hands, if you want a plan to be in the works. Also, I heard about the rehearsal dinner situation with your mom. I am sorry, and I am praying for you too.   Jesse: I have nothing to say to you. Oh wait, yes I do. Thanks for the CDs. Bill Evans kicks so much ass. I am burning you some selections from my collections that you might appreciate.  And, I am officially tapped out. I take my last drag of cigarette,                                             , pat Matt on the fur coated shoulder, (pat-pat), pee in the dark because I believe the light bulb is burned out in the bathroom again,           , and, collapse into a bed writhing with Sylvia fleas. Good night boys...  -Andrew  P.S. Jesse, I read today that white sage is an ancient aphrodisiac. Supposedly, if you bottle the smoke and then sniff it through a straw, it will make you very, very "potent," if you know what I mean. You should try it.  P.P.S. A&M: Mustaches? Are you mustachioed? Oh god I hope so...  kisses,  a.
