This article can be found in your South Bend Tribune for Sunday, June 27th.  I have chosen to summarize what it is because it's a phenomenal story of stupidity.   The article says one-third of emergency evacuations fail.  In some cases, planes are fined.  Of course, the government is doing  everything  to figure out what the root of the problem is.  This is a common problem says federal safety officials.  The article says the reason behind it is often workers failing to remove a pin from the slides even though there is an attachment that reads "remove before flight".  These pins make the slide inoperable.  Keep reading...  This dumbass article continues with a quote from a board chairman, "We need to find out why so many slides fail during actual evacuations."    Solution?  More tests on the slides that would cost more money for the airlines.  Also because of the tests, more planes would be taken out of use.  I am hoping you've caught on to my point.  My friends who have jobs, this is one of those things that affects taxes or takes away from money that could go to better things.
