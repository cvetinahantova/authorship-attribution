How can  freecycle.org  appeal to people like me? Interested in the environment, want to do my bit for it, have lots of stuff that just hangs around gathering dust and likes to share. I shared lots of files in cyberspace, you know? It appeals to me precisely because I can give my wanted but not useful stuff to the masses. We are blessed with materials that we want but we do not need. Don't believe me? Stop. Take a look around your room, workspace or whatever and count how many things you don't need. The answer is invariably more than one for most, because we don't need all we have, at least we needed it then, but not now.  So what can you do? Share them, or give them through freecycle.org. It's not only sensible, you're helping recycling in a big way. See there's 3 types of recycling: downcycling, upcycling and freecycling. Downcycling is what most people think recycling is, like giving a computer away for their parts to be disassembled and form something useful in the lower chain of the system. Upcycling is what writers of  "Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things"  claim to want to do. Their book is written in a new form of papers, the  Durabook . When you're done with the book, they claim that it can be upcycled to form something better than a book, like parts of a car.  Freecycling is what I'm preaching now. It is a harmless way of distributing things, it's fun as you can share, and it's easy to do. Just join the freecycling.org group in your cities and post things to be given away. Similarly if you see something you like that people post you can email them to request it. To me, this is the elusive win-win situation.  Here is a link to  freecycling.org singapore .
