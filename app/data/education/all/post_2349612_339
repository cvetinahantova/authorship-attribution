watching the news tonight, there was a blurb about west nile virus since 5 memphis zip codes have had animals test positive for it this summer again...  normally when they talk to someone on TV you see their name, and then a subtitle with what they do or where they work...  e.g. "rick pudwell -- memphis botanic garden" or "joe smith -- concerned neighbor"  today, one lady they had on had the best subtitle ever:  "terry walker -- duck eats mosquitoes"  ai yai yai  later dudes :-P
