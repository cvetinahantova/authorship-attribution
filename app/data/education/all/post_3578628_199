I agree with spencer that this place needs a change! maybe not some drastic, omg-everything-here-is-wrong change, but it needs to be different.  I dont have a problem reading about the political stuff, but i dont comment on it because it doesnt interest me. I dont even mind the sports stuff, even tho half the time i dont understand it. There are things that i expected out of this that i'm not getting. But now i realize that it's up to  me  and not kevin or spencer or josh. if I'm not reading things that i'm interested in, i can't blame them. they dont know what i want. only i do.  that's how you all should be. if you have a problem with what you're reading..or aren't reading, as the case may be...do something about it! it's like the whole voting thing..if you dont like how Bush is running the country, speak up and be an advocate for Kerry. Or whatever. just do something about it.
