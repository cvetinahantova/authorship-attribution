HANAMI PARTIES GALORE!        Well, I can now say that I have experienced both a night time and day time Hanami party!  Or in english terminology a picnic/drinking party under the trees.  As the seconds on the clock were slowly ticking away my last hour of the day yesterday, I was given something to look forward to as soon as I was able to head out into the sunshine and beautiful weather.  Through text messages on our keitais and a couple of phone calls, Stephanie, Jemma and I were going to meet at Shiogama Shrine to enjoy the great outdoors.  Stephanie and I of course stopped at the convenient store to pick up some snacks and what turned out to be a pretty bad bottle of wine.  Anyway, maybe it's the fresh air and the opportunity to relax outside that hit us quite hard, but it ended up being a 3 1/2 hour venture filled with random movie quotes, even more random song lyrics, and laughing so much it hurt.  And no it was NOT the wine because I didn't even have a full glass! It is incredibly nice to have good friends you can call at the end of the work day (whether it was a really good day or an awful one) who are just as eager to meet up, relax, and have a few laughs over snacks and eventually dinner.
