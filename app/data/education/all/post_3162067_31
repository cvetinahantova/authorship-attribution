Well, I have some more excellent news! I have another job interview: this time with a company I really want to work for. Naturally, this has made me very happy. Even better is that the office is across the road from the British museum: heaven! Culture AND good shopping (plus the Â£22'000 a year doesn't hurt.) My interview is Thursday 24th, so wish me lotsa luck! My back is killing me, but it is painkiller time so I should have known better really. Can't wait 'til the osteopath's appointment. Today I have Period pains. Just thought I'd share that!
