geez, that last post was a bummer.    but, of course, genuine. and that seems like a great goodness of blogging or any other kind of journaling -- leaving the rawness of down-ness out in public...  so today i've decided that while the arch-sin / root - sin / worst sin is still pride --   one of the most culturally pervasive expressions of it in the western evangelical world is --   forgetting to keep the SABBATH.   Rest.   i'm thinking today that the opposite of rest isn't motion -- its ambition.   And I need a break from my own crazy ambition.  i'm exhausting myself with the subtle inexplicit hubris of --  1.) saying yes to everything.  2.) trying to make the institutions i participate in... the best or better.   3.) doing my best at my work all the time (which inevitably means screwing up my best in other contexts)...  the lie of the public relations era -- and / or the bad version of the sophists -- and / or "quality stamped all over it."   is that whatever we do has to look like (/be) the best.   and that's not really seeming very core to the beattitudes or the fruits of the spirit or sacrifice or even plain old incarnation when i think about it...  but today's felt much better than yesterday -- i think b/c i'm resting -- worked out at the Y. Got a haircut.  went to the donut shop with the kids before jaelyn's school.  peace~
