Today we have a new Ethics teacher. She seems to be better than the previous one, she can talk, make some jokes and keep the class a little a live. But at the same time, she's also more demanding.   When we first heard that we'll have a new teacher, some of my classmates conspired and agreed that if the teacher ask whether we have any assignment, they would all say 'No'.   And that's exactly what they DID. So, the teacher gave us new assignments(actually the same one that our previous teacher gave, just that different groups are doing it now).   So my group (me, Vincent and A Jay) was given the topic: "Comparing Religions,their Beliefs and Practices".
