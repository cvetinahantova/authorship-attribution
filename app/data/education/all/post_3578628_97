Since when do amendments have anything to do with money? Last time I checked the only thing linking them was the fact that we pay congressmen money to spend time "attempting" to pass amendments.    So we're giving credit to founding fathers for building this country?  Hmm looks like they did a pretty crappy job.  Gun control, war, terror, welfare issues, medicare issues, white house trauma, voting problems, pollution, etc.  Yep...way to go Washington.  You should be proud.  Let's be honest.  We're as close to the shitter as you can get without having to sit down on it.    America needs new life.  One way to do it is to change the money.
