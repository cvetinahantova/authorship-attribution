urlLink After-School and Community Technology Education Programs for Low-Income Families. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Wendy Schwartz.  From the ERIC Digest:  The number of family programs in low-income communities that promote computer and internet literacy is steadily growing. They provide easy access to computer technology and instruction, courses for adults in parenting and job skills, educational and recreational after-school activities for children, and family learning activities. Many of the programs are characterized by partnerships among government agencies, corporations, and non-profit organizations that together are able to provide a wealth of resources (North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, NCREL, 2001; OMB Watch, 2000; Wilhelm, Carmen, & Reynolds, 2002).   Because many of the programs have not been operating very long, the process for evaluating the overall effectiveness of family technology programs is still in the early stages. To date, there have been small-scale but rigorous evaluations of some programs, and less formal studies based on interviews and observations have been conducted on others. Findings indicate that a high percentage of the programs are having at least some positive effects on participants' learning and community engagement, and guidelines for implementing effective after-school programs are emerging (Penuel & Kim, 2000).   This digest provides a review of these recommendations, but first presents brief descriptions of urban programs found to be effective for low-income youth and their families. Some are projects of national initiatives that welcome new local affiliates, while others are independent local programs whose creativity might spark the development of equally innovative programs elsewhere.
