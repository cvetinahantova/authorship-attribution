My husband and I have this on-going argument about what would be the best super power to have.  He has always maintained that instant transport would be the best.  I have to agree that instant transport would be really great.  You could instantly transport yourself to a cafe in Paris, wander around the city and then transport home for a good night's sleep and a shower.  However, after my last two conferences (and some experiences a couple of summers ago in Mexico and Belize), I think that being able to understand and speak any language would be a pretty cool power.  Now, if my husband and I could work together with these two powers (like the Wonder Twins) imagine the possibilities!  We could travel anywhere!
