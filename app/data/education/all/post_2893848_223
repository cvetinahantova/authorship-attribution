The Dog of War   I love my dog, and because she isn't a cat, I think it's okay for me to talk about that love here at Impeccable Jones.  She manages to be both lazy and a lot of fun, and I have immeasurable respect for the fact that she really will eat anything.  She's smart too; she knows both my name and my girlfriend's, and can do any of 10-12 tricks in exchange for food.  She isn't much of a guard dog-- her reactions to people and objects always fall somewhere between adoration and fear-- but hey, I can take care of myself.  Even if her love for me is simple, it is infinite, and I can only hope to return the favor.  (According to the vet, I return this favor a little too readily.  He says she's overweight.  But fuck him.)    A note on the photo:  this is not a knock on Dean.  Lucy only eats that which she loves.  And whatever it's worth, I only had that sticker because I had just voted for the guy.
