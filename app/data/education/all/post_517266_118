Indy - Spoke at Immaculate Heart of Mary school today to both the K through 4th grades and then the 5th through 8th.  It was a great school and I was happy to be part of such a positive day.  Plus, since this school is right down the street from where I live, it is nice to speak in your own back yard.  Thanks IMH!
