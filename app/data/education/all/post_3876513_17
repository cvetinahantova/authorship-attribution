Just heard from Dr. Clark's office--the culture came up negative. So now I'm going back to see him again on the 16th to find out what to do about this cough. Ugh. Doctor's appointment number 8 this summer. And right on the first day of new student orientation, too.  I'm a little crabby.    "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."    Romans 15:13
