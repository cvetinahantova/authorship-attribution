i managed to survive wednesday's training despite me feeling the effects of the flu. i couldn't feel my arms as me muscles were already beyong fatigue. peter sensei gave us fifty jogeburi, shomenuchi, sayumen followed immediately with 200 hayasaburi without any break. i survived and was able to continue with the next portion of the training. miracalously the symptoms disappeared and i felt energized. kendo does wonderful things to the mind and also the body.
