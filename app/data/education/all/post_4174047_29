urlLink    Not much going on these days, as the weather is terrible and the summer camp at my hagwon is FINALLY winding down...back to my regular schedule. So I decided to post another one of my dishes. Today, it's a Tofu (두부 -dubu) with sauce and hot peppers (고추-go-chu)....this is actually a common side dish that I buy from the 반찬 (bun-chun--Korean side dish) store.  Just fry up some Tofu till brown then pour sauce on top  Sauce: Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil, Vinegar, Gochu-Gadu (Hot chili pepper) and chop up some fresh hot peppers.  That's it, that's all...
