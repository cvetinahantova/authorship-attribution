I only made $20 at work today!  It was so friggin slow that I wanted to knaw my arm off!  It was like, I was looking for things to do, but there was nothing to do.  I ended up helping blow up Corona planes for the Jimmy Buffet ticket giveaway tomorrow night.  I don't have to work again till Sunday at 3.  I have to be there till 10-10:30.  Which means I'll get up to go to court and I'll be soooo tired.  But that's ok, it will be a good tired.  :)  Hopefully I will make more on Sunday night.  :)  I have to do laundry or I won't have any underwear to wear tomorrow.  :-P
