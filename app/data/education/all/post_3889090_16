My senses tell me about 'not me'. According to them, if I cannot see, hear, smell, taste or touch it, it doesn't exist. However that is not true in experience. There are countless things, that have been discovered by man that are not directly observable. Microwaves are a good example. They cannot be perceived by our senses, but the effects of concentrated microwave radiation are very obvious (think of hot microwaved food). So it's not reasonable from experience to believe that 'not me' is dependent upon my observation of it. In fact, 'not me' seems to be unaffected by my observations of it at all. This leads me to believe that 'not me' is much larger than my sense tell me.
