Last night I was reading Sting's book   urlLink   Broken Music     and was able to relate to the following passage.      "I will become so swept up in these journeys of discovery that I will continue to read and read, long after the academic need has passed. There are no books in my house apart from a Bible and some equally unfathomable engineering texts from my father's apprenticeship, but soon books will become for me an acquisitive passion filling up rooms and rooms with their dusty and inert bodies. Like my grandmother, I will never throw a book away, storing dog-eared paperbacks from school or college, year after year, stacked like hunting trophies on makeshift shelves in my room. For to sit in a room full of books, and remember the stories they told you, and to know precisely where each one is located and what was happening in your life at that time or where you were when you first read it is the languid and distilled pleasure of the connoisseur."   I love, love, love this passage! I had never been able to express my love of books as well as Sting has. It's true! I can think of a book I read and remember what was going on in my life at that time. Like Sting,  I too love being surrounded by books, see June 9, 2004   urlLink  posting   .      I am off to finish reading  Broken Music .
