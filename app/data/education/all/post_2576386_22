Working on the premise that a poem is really meant to be heard,  urlLink Batjay  was kind enough to do a voice over of an edited version of my Desiderata translation. You may want to check it out. Hmmm, this may be the first collaborative work of bloggers.  Here it is"   urlLink  "mga mithiin"  .    Likewise, you can also hear it  urlLink here . Thanks Batjay.   Incidentally, my Latina friend, poet Gloria Pimentel Laven sent me the name of the guy who did the recording of the Desiderata which I loved listening to during the 70's. His name is Les Crane! Her husband John has always been handy.  Thanks guys.
