I haven't updated in awhile.  I don't really have much time as I have been reading everyone else's blogs.  There is always shit I wanna say but when I get here it just all seems to evaporate.  This week has been cool.  I met some girls in Seattle's Best on Tuesday and I'll see one of them again this weekend for coffee.  Fenton's B-day is this Saturday so that should be fun.  He wants to eat Sam gyup sal but I'm not sure I'm over my last experience from last Saturday.  I feel like a snake that ate a big mouse and now doesn't need to eat for weeks.  My diet has gotten a lot more healthy over the past few weeks though, so I'm proud of that.  I want to do something tonight but looks like I might be alone.  I don't think anyone is up for anything.  We'll see.  I'll go downtown and at least hang out a bit and maybe I'll run into someone or find something to do.  I had a teachers meeting yesterday which bordered on crazy.  I guess I can't really get into it b/c there is a slight chance that someone could link to my page from Asma's and word could get back to the big dogs.  It is probably best left unsaid anyway.  Saw "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" on Wednesday/Thursday morning.  I'm still not set in my opinion but I'll say I wasn't knocked off of my feet.  Some stuff was laughable.  Overall it was a good flick but not as good as the other two.  If someone wants to hangout tonight let me know.  I think it would be good to head out in a group of not 15 or 20 for once.  Just my opinion.  I need to get some warmer clothes.  Stuff is getting cold around here.  I'd like to say thank you to Ji-eun for posting to my sight.  I said I'd write about her which I will in my next entry.  I have to roll to class now.
