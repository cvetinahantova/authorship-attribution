Time..will you freeze for me Just for a while Don’t go too fast, I can’t catch you  Time, I used to wish you could go back Wished I could re-run you  I can’t, can I ?  Time Will you freeze for me  I want to look at myself without scared of Running of you   having my heart broken after falling in love Losing my dearests Hurting someone  That’s why… Time, will you freeze for me?
