Ho hum. Another late awakening, another wasted day. After voicing some concerns to Sean last night, said concerns have been playing on my mind a little. I've mentioned it before on here; the total feeling of inadequacy I get when I'm around the JYF girls. They're all small and pretty and size 10, they swap clothes with each other and get all the attention, and they're so confident and sexy. When I'm around them I just stick out. I'm the "sensible" one; I don't have the quirky fashion sense or the confidence, I can't swap clothes with them and I don't get the attention they do. I'm don't want to be like them, as such, and I'm not craving for attention, but I think I'd just like to fit in with them a little more, and the fact that it's actually physically impossible for me to be half those things makes it even more annoying. The Rosy Glows say it all: on all of theirs, the lads say "it was so great to see you, you're gorgeous/wonderful/sexy/so cool and I can't wait to see you again" and on mine they say "hey! Good to see you again, we really should meet up sometime". Sean told me not to be silly and that I was pretty too, and that Sam could back him up on this, but I don't feel it. They see me in a totally different light from the other girls. They're potential girlfriends, or people they might pull if they get the chance, whereas I'm just their mate, good for a laugh, nice to talk to. And when that's made blatantly obvious from what someone's written on your rosy glow, no amount of their telling you you're pretty is going to change that.  Ceff x   I never will be good enough for her
