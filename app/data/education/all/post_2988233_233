I have had back and hip trouble ever since the first pregnancy with TJ.    I can even tell you when, and where it happened.    I won't though.  BUt I have found a great home remedy.  Are you ready????  Sex.  Yes, you read right, Sex.  I can be in so much pain, I can't move, my hips be so stiff my legs won't work, and a little mattress mambo, and I am up and running.  Go figure.
