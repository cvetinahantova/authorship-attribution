Tax Cuts for Good Citizenship   In a democracy, every individual is a legislator, in that they help to make decisions.  Every individual has a job that everyone else in the community (and any individual who is affected by that community) needs to be done well.  A citizen who is aware of the world and interacts with their community is a more effective legislator than one who is not (not in the power of the vote, but in the wisdom that was used to decide on what way to vote).  Furthermore, a citizen who does not vote is allowing the government to have more control; to allow big business and other institutions to have more control over the choices of the representatives.  We can see two duties from these two concepts: 1. the citizen ought to be aware and conscious of everyone in his community. 2. The citizen ought to vote.  A citizen who does not fulfill either one or both duty is indirectly harming the other people in her community.  Thus, it would be just to reward the citizen who fulfills these duties, or to punish those who do not.  For example, we could give tax cuts to those citizens who have voted during a given year (a fixed cut of a certain dollar amount, ignoring percentages) and to those citizens who participate in community organizations that increase that individual's awareness of the diverse group of people in his community (both local, global, and everything in between).
