I am glad that my sweet wife helped me to see the error of my ways when she wrote me an email and told me Mr. Rogers died last year and Captain Kangaroo is the gentleman who died and was 76 years old just this week.  OOOPSSS.  I feel like a baby boomer for sure......  Thanks honey for the quick save with my writing.  Writing is always 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  Luckily for me I have a couple of folks who have a sharp eye and a keen sense of dates and who is who that can keep my brain on the right track.
