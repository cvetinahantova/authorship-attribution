hello,  well the inevitable happened sister erlinda found out my cell phone number.   damn.  i thought i had hidden it well, but someone must have told her or i  accidently put it on one of the half dozen forms she has us filling out  every week.  anyway...  she called last night to see if i could take an  extra class today.  since i'm more than willing to pick up a few extra  classes a week i wasn't pissed about the phone call just the fact that now  she has my digits and i know it won't be the last time she calls.  ugh!  oh  well nothing i can do now i programmed the number she called me on into my  phone so hopefully i can screen her out, but she is very determined when she  wants to talk with you.  crazy nun.  anyway...  i'm having nun of that. ha.  o.k. i know i'm a dork.  well school is going o.k. i'm working with the girls.  i wish i new more  about teaching phonetics because i think i have a rare opportunity to really  work with the girls.  since i don't have a book and i am basically creating  a class as i go i have lots of directions i could go but i'm unsure what is  the best for the girls.  also, i have so many ages that it is also difficult  for me to complete my lesson plans.  i just don't know until i get into the  classroom what is going to work and what is not.  but hey i'm staying  flexible and even when i have to scrap a lesson plan i still come up with  something for them to do.  well i hope eveyone is enjoying that mississippi heat.  i love ya.  oh wait one more thing.  i've been getting lots of emails saying things  about thailand being so exotic and third world.  oxford, ms is third world  compared to bangkok.  there is everything here that you can imagine, well  except good soul food.  i think some of your perceptions about how and where  i am living might be a little off.  with six million plus people bangkok has  a little of everything.  i hope anyone who wants to can come over for a  visit.  i'd love for ya'll to see the place.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?
