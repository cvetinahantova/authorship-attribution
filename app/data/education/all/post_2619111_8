Well it does not seem so long ago that I was last on team retreat, but  in the next 30 minutes I will be picked up and whisked off to Turvey  Abbey.  As I look back and think about what has happened since last  retreat I realise that is has been a bust 8 weeks.  I have been to  Osmington with year 7; what an amazing time getting to know the young  people and also making friends with lots of teachers.  I have felt like my involvement in the life of the school has  increased.  I have been asked quite a few things by teachers just  looking for some advice or even just a sounding board to off load to,  this I enjoy as it feels that they trust me.  Earlier this week I went on a jolly to pick up a pupil with teacher  (who is also a great friend) who decided to run away, got quite far out  of Luton (about 20 miles, and he was walking!).  we picked him the  teacher took us all for some lunch and we talked about what had  happened.  It seemed that he just worked himself up into a state.  We  then took him back home and chatted with his parents about what and how  we can help him.  It was good to be able to help the teacher and the pupil, I told the  teacher that I am praying for him, at which point she was pleased.  It is sometimes hard to let teachers or even pupils that I praying for  them or about issues.  It does seem though that God really does bless  these words.  Oh well time to leave.
