Things are teh suck today. Mainly because, despite my meticulous bookkeeping, the bank says we're overdrawn. I've gone over everything a billion times and don't see AT ALL how that could have happened. ::sigh:: Andy'll flip when he hears about this. Money matters depress him big time. Plus, at some point last night, my dog chewed a hole about the size of a golf ball in my blanket on my bed. ::grrrr::  Other than that, I guess everything's ok. There's a cute little 2 year old girl in the computer lab right now that's cracking me up.  ::sigh again:: So tired, too. No idea why. I've been getting plenty of sleep. I guess my body just hasn't adjusted to the changes yet.  In other news, anybody wach the State of the Union address last night? What a laugh. Of course, in my family, we turn it into our own little version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. It's fun. But the fact that Bush is trying to convince us that "employment is on the rise"? Or that "the economy is stable and getting better"? Whatever!  Only Amercan Idol made me laugh more. There's some reeeeeeally bad talent out there.
