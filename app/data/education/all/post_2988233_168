My oldest son just told me I am too uptight.    He likes his dad's morals better than mine.  I don't get his needs he says.    Why does he say this?  Because I don't agree with him listening to Richard Pryor, I don't agree with him watching soft porn on cable after midnight.  I don't like to hear 14 year old cuss like sailors.  I don't like watching TV and hearing my son talk about women on TV liek they are objects, and not humans.    I am trying my best to NOT raise a male chauvenist pig.  TRYING.    This same son told me the other day, that his wife was going to be a virgin, he wasn't having and used meat.  His words, not mine.    But he plans on getting all the honey's he can.  I told him he was flat wrong.  That personally, yes, I wish he would wait until he was sure he loved the one he chose to be with.  But there were more things to worry about these days than just getting a girl pregnant.  He says yeah, but that won't happen to me.    He is 14, and I just lost him.  I don't mean for good, I AM his mom, but he has seen the greener pasture and has crawled over the fence.
