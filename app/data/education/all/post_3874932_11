Do you think there's any chance that we could get some of our seniors to participate in our blog? They could just comment -- they wouldn't have to post directly to the blog.  Maybe we could even ask anyone with parents and grandparents that are interested to participate.  They might have some ideas as well.  Or, maybe no one will want to particpate in the blog!  I taped a show last week for Beachview (University TV here at CSULB that goes on cable and isn't all that widely viewed) -- President Maxson thought it was one of the best segments he's done and the camera man really wanted to tell me about his 84 year old father and computers.  I think there's interest in the topic.  Or maybe we could create a separate blog that was more selective for this group of people so that we could have them respond to specific issues and questions we might have.
