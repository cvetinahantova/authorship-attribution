"Yes!" I thought as I picked out the free CD from yesterday's guardian.  "A sampler of Some of Electronica's finest.  I shall pass this to  urlLink Si  and then he will have to admit that I am right."  But 4 tracks in I wasn't so sure.  A lot of it was, in Si's words "empty, vacant and souless".  I think the reason has to do with restraint.  The tracks that were succesful were those that gave space.  Some tried to squeeze too much in and so managed to squeeze the beauty out.  At its best, dance music that came after acid house can convey emotions and tell stories as well as any other.  But it's too easy to make electronica bad by putting in too much.  Too many sounds, to many influences, to little restraint.  I was reminded of this as I watched  urlLink Basement Jaxx  on TV last night.  Sure they got the Glastonbury crowd going but for me there was just little too much going on.  Maybe one or two ideas less in each song and there would be something more powerful said.  That is why I mark the passing of  urlLink Orbital  who play their last gig at Glastonbury tonight.  Theirs was dignified, dance music that would move your feet but could also tell stories.  They had ideas and ambition, but not in excess.  On the whole they avoided the temptation of overcrowding their work.  THe Guardian CD showed this.  Their tracks, especially Chime and Belfast towered over the others.
