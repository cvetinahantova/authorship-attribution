Well here we are several weeks into the school summer holidays and if I hear the words 'I'm bored' or 'are we going somewhere nice today' I think I may just go mad!  Why is it that children nowadays seem to think that parents were put here solely for entertaining their children? Or, is it just my children?   When I was a child my father worked strange shifts and my mother didn't drive. We lived in a small village about 8miles from the nearest town and the bus service was virtually non existent. Asking my Mum if we were going anywhere nice today' would surely have earned me a clip around the earhole!  I'm not saying that I never got bored, I just knew better than to complain about it and managed to find things to do to amuse myself.  We bought a puppy back in June. I kinda thought that the children may have some fun with her but if you mention playing with her or taking her for a walk they have some reason why they don't want to ie. I'm watching this on the tele. This happens if they've only been complaining how bored they are minutes before!  To make matters worse the kids can't seem to get along for more than about 2 minutes before they're at each other's throats (quite literally). I feel so tired just recently (guess it's the hormones or something) and quite frankly the children are driving both me and my darling husband up the wall!!  They don't seem to be able to see that they're driving you mad until you're nose to nose shouting at them. I just don't know how they can be so unaware of people's feelings.  I love them to death, of course I do, I just could really do with them not being around at the moment. Does that sound bad??  Well I've got that off my chest. Any advice would be gladly accepted.
