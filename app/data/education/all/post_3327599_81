Ashley Senior said i should. anyway. i knew the dinner was on the 30th i just don't have a time it starts.. and when you call it a "wild pig festival" you make us sound so redneckish.. haha! Hopefully the Rays with be there and make it complete.  i went to the zoo yesterday. that as a lot of work.. but i know the zoo is something i can do next time cuz they loved it. and then today i got the day off which would have been ok ya know.. if he paid me! it's almost 6 and i still haven't heard from him and i dont exactly want to call and be like where's my money ya know? my goats are suffering more then i am tho cuz they haven't been fed yet and i'm out of feed.   Lindsay and i went to see Raising Helen today, it was cute. it made me almost cry lol. after that we went to the mall. i think i embarrassed Lindsay lol.. as we were walking back to my car some comment was made about the guys walking into the mall cuz they were looking at us so i yelled out after we walked by "oo the guy in the yellow hat was hott don't you think?!?!" and she was like OMG ASHLEY. oh well.. lol that's what happens when ppl look at me and i have someone with me who gets embarrassed easily..   nothing else to talk about.. Lindsay and John are lighting things on fire.. i should probably stop them but i'm not lol.
