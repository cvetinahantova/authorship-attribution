Hay! Que horror! Sobrang toxic this morning. I miss my cookie. He's still in Batangas. Later pa siya go home.  Had lunch with Kuya Chinoat Friday's in Glorietta Then he went back to the office while I ran errands for GSB. I had to buy gifts for the conference. Passed by Powerplant to but wrapper and ribbons before going to Ateneo Rockwell. Started wrapping the trivia gifts in Rockwell. Jingle asked if I could wrap the jackets as well.... oh well...was finally done at 7:30pm.   Mike called, on their way home na. They still have an 8pm dinner meeting with a client at Off the Grill in QC. I was so tired I just watched TV and slept early.
