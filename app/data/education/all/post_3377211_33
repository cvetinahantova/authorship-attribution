From what I understand, it's been almost two weeks since blogging.  What happened, you ask?  NOT A FREAKING THING!   I have no job acquisition to report of, no broken bones, no earth-shattering story to tell about how I almost died while saving the lives of strangers, and no pictures to post!    It was actually an uneventful 14 days that went by since my last blog.   I had a decent interview with Victor Cental Schools last week, but I won't find out about that until the end of this week.  Other than looking for jobs, I have been working my tail off for a paycheck that might as well read "$0.00" on it.  I love my job, but I can't understand how I lose more from a six week job in taxes then I do when I sub during the school year.  It's very frustrating.   The only highlite worth reporting is my very fun day with my best friend Chip two fridays ago.  He took the day off so we could hang out for the day, which allowed us to see  The Village  (which I thought was awesome - but I stand head and shoulders above everybody else when it comes to opinions on movies :) ).  We also started playing this nerd-game called  Pirates of the Spanish Main  which actually allows us to create fleets of ships for naval combat (16th century style!).  That was a fun day.   I also have one story of interest.  It involves a phone call with a man named   George Lucas.    I'll post that tomorrow.
