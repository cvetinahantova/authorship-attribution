Okay, so after all the last posting, we changed our minds yet again (we are female after all) and have booked ourselves bus tickets which will see us arriving in Athens tomorrow afternoon at 6 o' clock!  How excited are we?!  We are booked in the hotel Kostas (cheers me dears - we are very grateful for the invitation) and generally just thought...when else are we gonna see the Olmypics in it's original location (ok so that stadium is slightly more modern these days!), so...away we go.  Kavos:-  Kavos - hmm...let's think, what  can  we possibly say!  Let's comment individually, shall we?!  Claire thinks:  Possibly the worst of Brits abroad...everything and everything that foreigners hate about us exists here in these few little streets in the sun.  The place is lined with bars along a 'strip' which play music 24/7 (loudly) and the touts that try to get you in their bars are, to say the least .....annoying!  (mild, very mild).  Everyone we have met comes from either Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle or Doncaster (so we are apparently rather posh - oh if only they knew) and not a single Australian in sight!   But, if you can't beat 'em....so once i got over my initial reservations, i've had a quite good time, dancing the night away, doing dares that no-one would have dreamed that I would do and generally just enjoying it!  Looking forward to Athens tho....!  Gem thinks: Its Okay!!  Quite nice to hear a British accent.  It's touting heaven and not a pink drink in sight - thank god!  We are in a room where Claire sees dead people and scares the living daylights out of me AND the door won't lock from the inside so when i got in pissed from seeing Kez and Sue to the bus i thought the flimsy dressing table stool would save us from all evil!!  Let's hope i'm right!  That's all folks...not sure where we'll go after Athens (maybe I'll take Gem to Ios - Sarah, what do you think????!!!!) but we do aim to make it to north Italy, really, we do!
