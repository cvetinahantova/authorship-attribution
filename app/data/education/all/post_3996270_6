Halo 2 looks like it will be really awesome, but there are some things that i would like to know about the game if someone can tell me please reply to this post. The first thing that i want to know is weather you will be able to drive the Covanent ships, Will you be able to use all their weapons, what planet is the game based on, and will they still have all of the same enemy's in the game or will they be putting new creatures into the levels.
