UGH! So it's only Thursday.  Blah.  I am so freakin ready for it to be this weekend, not that I have plans yet.  I should probably get on that, because it would suck ass to be stuck at home with no cable and no Internet.  Well I did start a new book, so I guess I could read, but I'd rather go out!  I don't have much to write about at the moment, but I wanted to waste some time so here I am.  I am goin to Tech Electric in Maumelle today to pick out a new fan for my room!! I can't wait!  So I guess that will be my purchase for this week, next week will have to be a rug!  My bed is on wheels so every time I even slightly touch it the bed goes sailing across the room!  So I need something to stabilize it.  LOL.  I have so much stuff to buy for the new house...eek!! I think I'm gonna need a second job!  Any suggestions?  Ok well I am off to do some real work now, hee hee not really!  I probably just gonna look at stuff online.
