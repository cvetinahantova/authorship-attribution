urlLink ALA | Resources for Library Instruction  I noticed that there is a library instruction resources page up at the new (poorly) designed American Library Association site.  The site reads, "This page collects existing Instruction Section resources such as bibliographies, tips and ideas, conference program materials, etc. that may be of use for library instructors and instruction."  Right now, that is not a lot here.  However, it has the potential to be useful if more content is added.  Also, it needs content that is not the result of some ALA committee.
