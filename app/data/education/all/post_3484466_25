The AP Physics book is a beast, as well as the summer assignment. I'll probably do it right away, so I don't have to do it last minute before school starts...  Anyway, last day of school! Yay! Tomorrow is technically the 181st attendance day, and they don't even take roll, so there's really no point in going. I'm going anyway... But, yeah. Fun stuff.  So, I'm going to... oh, wow. I have nothing to do. Insane. I'll eat something and be back.  Current Music: Human League - Don't You Want Me
