The Sky is, in fact, Right Where You Left It    urlLink Schill the Chill keeps the Sox from going two games under .500 for the first time in eight years .  Even if those two games would have been the only ones played, us dorks must work with the numbers we are given.  Along the same lines, the D-Rays are still dominating the AL East, and the Overmen are in last place.   (Damn the law of averages.  Statistical prediction can feel a little too godly sometimes.)  It is incredibly unlikely that anyone reading this would simultaneously care, not know already, and be able to attend, but I am giving a reading tonight at The Mill in Iowa City at 9 pm along with Poet Steve Kramp.  If you are one of the few, please come.  The estimable Jane Roper and Jared Stanley will provide introductions.  If anyone is wondering why Scott is so uncharacteristically quiet lately, it's because he just got a job, inexplicably, at  urlLink Poetry Magazine .  Yes, that  urlLink Poetry Magazine , and no, I can't explain how this happened.  So he's busy and all, but he also needs our help.    When asked what poets he likes, the best Scott was able to tell his shaggy and bespectacled co-workers was that he digs Denis Johnson and Jim Morrison.  Okay- he didn't say the last one, but he might as well have, they were so unimpressed.  So:  what poets should Scooter read and/or claim to have read?  There's employment on the line here, people.  I listed the poetry faculty for him here at the workshop,but that is a short supply of names and it will probably run out by the end of the week.    In comments, please complete the following sentence:  "Hi.  My name is Scott.  No, it's okay, you don't remember my name.  Really.  I was reading the poetry of _______ this weekend and I was really impressed by the manner in which he/she used _________ to convey_________.  It's ___________, really."  I'll put all your answers on notecards and mail them to Scott so he can practice in front of the mirror.  But seriously, folks.  Scott's Impeccable congratulations is a little overdue:  good work, bro.  And yes, I am razzing him a bit.  I know few people who would be more at home working for a lit mag.
