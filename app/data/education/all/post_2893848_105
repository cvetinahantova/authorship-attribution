You know what?  Fuck Canada.   I know making fun of Canada is for 14 year olds, and I know it's a cool place, full of nice people, free pills, and world famous cheeba, and that secretly, we all would rather be Canadian.  But every now and then, those fuckers  urlLink say something that really pisses me off   (Via  urlLink Joy of Sox ).
