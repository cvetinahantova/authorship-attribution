It is an art to hide.  Do not ask how I know this, just accept it as a given variable.  Consider the evidence; clothing is considered fashionable, and artsy.  What are you doing by wearing clothing but hiding your beutifull body?  It is NOT fashionable therefore to be naked, so, why is it clothing over the generations (especially for females) has become less and less evident.  In fact evidence of clothing is extremely hard to find off of nudists or their beaches.      From this we(I) can derive nudists are never artists, and therefore artisic mediums should be witheld from them(a terrible waste of resources otherwise).  I am deeply sorry for all nudists everywhere if I have offended you, but I beg you to proove me wrong nudists.  Send me, John Molloy, all your best nudist art(I'm sure it will not be worthy of interpretation).      Where have I gone?  Back to the topic.  How NOT to be seen.       1.  Use a bush to hide behind.      2.  Use two bushes to hide behind.      3.  Use three bushes to hide behind.      4.  Do not use more than three bushes however, or nudism will ensue.      5.  Use clothing(or scars).      6.  Do not even consider other places to hide.       So there you(I) have it, the art of NOT being seen.  Please partake all non-mudists, in this art, wherever or whenever you see fit.    PS. I'll be in Italy from July 28-June 17, don't expect anything from me within that time.
