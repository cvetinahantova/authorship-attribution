Wow looks like I hit a nerve with an overly sensitive individual that I won't name.  Too bad for him.  But if you'd like to find out who and how mad he is just click  urlLink here .   Well tonight is a hot bowl squid rice night.  I'll be meeting Asma and possibly other to enjoy the warm goodness of squid rice.  It is so good when it is it cold outside.  Afterwards we'll head out and see what his happening downtown.  I am excited.  I'm in a mood to go out and have fun.  I'd like to hit some places besides The Commune for a change.  As nice as it is we always seem to be there.  These days Bubble Bar seems to really be happening.  Last night I got a pretty good nights sleep.  The hat that I invested in is paying big dividends in the form of good sleep.  It is still loud as hell around my place due to the airforce base and the crazy people trying to sell veggies and fruits at like 8 in the a.m.   I wonder if any new movies came out today?  I hope so.  I enjoy watching movies on Sunday afternoon but I don't want to see The Matrix 3 again, at least not yet.   I've been on a run of good luck at the gym lately.  For some reason OCN and Super Action channels have been showing really good movies in the morning.  This makes the kilometers on the  treadmill and cycle go by much faster.  Today was The Shawshank Redemption.  Can you really believe that lost best picture to Forest Gump.  Tough call.  It is also good practice for my Korean since it is all in subtitles.  Also this week they had MIB, Mortal Kombat and something else that I can't remember.  Off to teach the little Korean kids more English.  Until next time.
