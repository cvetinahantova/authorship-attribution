Ok who just blogged his little heart out just to have the computer freeze and lose everything.  Yeah that would be me.  It figures.  I was all like "man stuff is so great I'm having such a good time, today was awesome."  Then just like that it all came to an end.  Oh well not the worst thing that could happen.  My day has been great and the trip keeps getting better and better so I can't complain.  I'm no in Nha Trang and it's a pretty hype place.  I'm seaside and loving it.  I cruised around on a motor bike this afternoon and check out the important sites.  So now that this is out of the way I can go island hopping tomorrow.   I wrote a lot more but you'll have to settle for this shorter version seeing as how I'm going to go home and get cleaned up.  Hope all is well with everyone.
