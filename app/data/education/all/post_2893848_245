Show me show me show me how you do that trick by Scott  Moore's an asshole, I'm with you there on him. Most people I know are assholes, and they bask in their righteousness as if it was a old GTO with loud pipes that they just fixed up. However, to like being righteous is what makes this "documentary" so damn incendiary and allows us the delight to react with such opposing gusto. (Hitchens included in "us.") Moore can't possibly make an "objective" movie, just as Fox can't provide us with news that doesn't include extraneous celebrity marketing (eg, Michael Moore's new movie). But people, I mean, Americans, I mean, those who believe that celebrity news is in fact news, don't want unrighteous, fact-driven objectivity. The proof's in the pudding, the fact that celebrities are even given some of the news spotlight is preposterous, bizarre, and comically rumor-mill. This isn't another whiny complaint about our SUV-driving, mocha-chuggin', Home Depot-refurnishing ethos. Our culture is divided for multiple reasons that I blame mostly on Christian fundamentalism and its subsequent entitlement beliefs. What I'm talking about, and what I genuinely like about Moore, is how similar his sensationalism is to the rest of today's mediocre "journalism,"  and yet that much more incendiary. Nobody's dogging  urlLink Bill Kurtis  for his report on 9/11, or those two Polish brothers who filmed the fireman story and "turned away" from the gruesome and inapproapriate footage. Their journalism is no less slanted than Moore's. Granted, Moore's a little more Op-Ed, a little more Orson Welles. But everybody's going after this pudgy guy from Michigan, and it's because he's the news. Really, that's it.
