Simon just popped in and asked how I was. Then asked how things were at home. I told him I thought Sandra was jealous of the fact that I had been out enjoying myself while she was at home with the kids.  His comment was "so she's had them for a day for a change, rather than dumping them at my mums, you mean". From my point of view it seemed a strange thing to say and I took it as though he was sort of telling me he supported me. Almost as though it was his way of telling me she should buck her ideas up.  I can't quite work it out though, so I don't know if I am on the right wavelength.
