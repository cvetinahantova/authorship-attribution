Well, today was quite nice.  In a change up from my regular ritual, where Kyle comes home from work, we chat idly until Erika shows up, then we watch TV and eat supper, today we did something different.  We all chatted away, for a few hours, incorporating supper into the ritual.  It was quite nice!  I've always enjoyed those moments in life, the ones where you know you are fitting in just perfectly.  You are sitting with somebody, or doing something, and everything in the universe just seems right.  It's hard to explain, but I'm sure that other people experience this.  It was like that today.  The three of us, just chatting about this and that, the conversation flowing from topic to topic, and feeling simply content.  It was quite nice.  I haven't had a chance to experience a feeling of calm and contentment as of late, with all this Japan stuff, and career stuff floating around, so this was a very welcome break!  I've always counted myself lucky in terms of the friends I keep.  I have never had an abundance of friends.  In high school I really only communicated with a handful of people, and university was much the same, but the friends that I do keep are awesome.  Some people enjoy having tons of friends, but I've always preferred having a few close friends, people who I would do anything for.  Kyle and Erika fit that exatly.  It's nice to know that they'd do the same for me if needed.  So, I guess when I'm feeling down or messed up, all I need to do is think about how lucky I am, and what I still have around me.  Things are almost never as bad as they seem.  I've always believed that things work out in the end, as they have to, so I think I need to start revisiting that philosophy.  Until next time!
