For those of you who use a rss reader (go  urlLink here  or  urlLink here  if you need a free one) will be glad to see a "read the bible in a year" rss feed sponsered by the ESV people. urlLink ESV Bible RSS Feeds  they have verse a day at random, "good" verse a day, and several differing options on how one might read through the bible in a year all syndicated via rss 2.0.  Very cool stuff. A couple of other cool feeds:  the   urlLink weather forcast /report customized by you, ;  urlLink the word of the day , and the  urlLink feed for this Blog ; great stuff. also, though I don't use it, there is a news reader plug in for firefox ( urlLink aggreg8 ) as well as for Internet Explorer ( urlLink pluck )
