Hello my new bloggy,  It's been a century since i last blogged. Yeaha. The last time was last last Saturday. =P  14 Aug 2004, Saturday. Had my chemistry  common test. Actually it was a real scare. The first question was so tough man. Shook me quite abit. But I gave my all to crap it through. =P And guess what, God is good.. 75% for this common test. =D Top my class sia. Tyco kia.. Went for bB after that, had a great time with my CE1s again. Sean, Jun Rong and Meng Huat scored full marks for the memory verses. =) Well done guys.  15 Aug 2004, Sunday. Hhhmm.
