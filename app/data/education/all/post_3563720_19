I recently saw an Aladdin Bail Bonds commercial on television. No entertainment value. A bunch of clean-cut people blabbing about how they were arrested. No catchy song, no friendly corporate image.  Bad Boys Bail Bonds, on the other hand, has the most hilarious radio commericals ever (especially on Power 106/100.3 The Beat). The commercial definitely has racial overtones, but it is still effective at reaching its target demographic group in Los Angeles County (you can figure it out).  "I'm gonna call my bail guy tonight...and get released...and go to the house...1-800-BAIL-GUY tonight..." I shouldn't joke about such matters. It is bad karma.  Plus, I already know a bail bondsman.
