...caffeine free diet coke.  I am in renton, washington.  east side.  (what, what).  I am in trevor's big a-word house.  I ate a big bowl of chili about hour ago so i'm excited to see how that mother's gonna work itself out.  i'll give a full report.  it's the 6th today, which means that yesterday at 5:29 p.m. eastern standard time I turned 24 years old.  It's the same as before, just now it's officially another year of slacking my life away.  I bought some gillete razors today.  a 4 pack.  big decision whether or not to purchase the 2-blade or 3-blade model.  i went for the 2er.  i'm frugal you know (at least that's what all the hot ladies say). in case you're wondering, whivh i know you are...yes I am wearing a viking helmet with horns on it.  i rather enjoy wearing it, so back the heck up, holmes.  get off my game. trev and i are to meet up in a joyous reunion with brent tonight.   what do you call those hand-gripper, strengthening metal exercise things?  I'm playing with one now.  it kicks a-word. i rode a stationary bike today.  it was amazing.  it was like a bike, but was in a house and didn't go anywhere!  it just stayed in the same place.  i've never seen anything like it.  and hope to never again.  it frightened me.  someone must have conjure a spirit and cast it into that thing. Question:back alley, bare knuckle brawl.  who wins, Glue Stick or White Out?  My money's on White OUT!  p.s. i know this is dude of me, but i'm mirroring this on my site.  i'm too lazy to thing of other not-quite-witty things to write about. so L and Z word you!
