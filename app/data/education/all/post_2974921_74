today was our math and pinoy exams. needless to say, i had a hard time in math. it was so hard and the kodigo i made wasn't even useful! well, that's okay, i did my best..i think. it's just that i couldn't concentrate. i kept on thinking about jammi. he called last night but we kept cutting off because his mom was using the phone. anyway, he asked me out. we're planning to watch a play in ateneo tomorrow even if i know very well we'll be doing sopmething else. my god! i had to think of a way to be able to go. luckily, carmina's gonna ask her folks if she could go so she could come with me. i just need some fake excuse for my folks. but... i don't feel so good about it. somehow, i feel kinda used. this is the second time i have to break my rules just for a guy. but this is different..i'm in love with this guy... but that's what i said about JP! but i really wanna see him again! i wanna hug him and kiss him... i just wanna be with him....
