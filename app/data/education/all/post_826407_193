urlLink The shortlist for the most interesting music prize of the year  was released last week.  There doesn't seem to be the odd outsiders like in previous years but its a pretty good list.  Obvious (but not undeserved) nominations for Keane, Franz Ferdinand, Snow Patrol and the Streets.    Very exciting to see Ty nominated though!   It'll be a tough year to call.  I reckon it will go to the streets.  He missed out to Ms Dynamite 2 years ago and A grand don't... is probably the most ambitious album on the list.  But the Mercury often has a surprise at the end.
