Why am I always so stupid?  I am insecure, and awful, and sabotaging my own life!  I went to convocation on Tuesday, and saw my prince.  Actually, he is just a remarkably lovely man that I see around my academic building occassionally.  I used to also see him in my apt building, last year when I was still living in the dump called Fenwick.  Anyway, turns out he was graduating as well, but from undergrad.  With a university award, no less.  I noted his name, and googled him today... first off, he is brilliant.  Nominated for a Rhodes Scholarship, among others.  Offered a 6-figure scholarship to go to University of Chicago (unheard of!).  Leaving in the fall for England.  Depression setting in...   I noticed him a year ago!  Or more!  Why didn't I ask him out!?  I am complete shit.  And he is just so lovely.  If anyone knows a brilliant man named Andrew, please tell him I am sorry I never asked him out.
