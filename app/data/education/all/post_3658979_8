I must admit it.  I love sappy movies.  I adore them.  One of my very favorite things to do is sit in a dark movie theater for 90-120 minutes and just sob away.  I love a good cry.   This time it was The Notebook.  Don't go see this unless you want to bawl your eyes out.  It is a completely idealistic movie about true, unadulterated, passionate love.  Of course there are classic tones to it.  Rich city girl.  Poor country boy.  Her parents hate him and forbid her to see him.  They lose each other.  She falls in love with rich boy.  Poor boy finds her again.  Don't worry--I don't intend on ruining the ending for you.   There is something about love stories.  They're so endearing.  And you can always somehow relate.  You can always find something in that story that has to do with you and your true love.  I think that's what makes us cry so hard.  Knowing that love is real.  Love is true.   Great sob fest.  Loved it.  Want to see it again.
