I don't know what came over me today.  I just wanted a latte.  I felt the need for one, and scapped together four bucks for a tall, iced latte with soy milk.  It tastes great.  LOL.  Thnakfully I have my tank gassed, so I don't have to worry about it.    If only Latte's were fuel.  I have a quiz to take, one I'm so not prepared for, so I might as well get that misery over.  Completed one of my finals, now I have a couple more to go, and that's just crazy!!!!   I'm tired, and someone who is not handicapped keeps buzzing to be let through the handicapped doors.  That's just lazy.  I'm spent.  Let me take my test.
