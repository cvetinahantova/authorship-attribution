today was good. In the morning i just sat around because i had nothing else to do. At 4 i went to the high school and got my physical and took my imPACT tests for football. It was a waste of time and took forever. Anyways, when i got done, janelle and my mother were waiting for me. I drove us to mcdonalds and we got some dinner. Came home and ate obviously then me and janelle went upstairs. We watched some tv for like 10 minutes then started to watch a movie, we watched about a half hour of it but it was going really slow and boring janelle so i stopped it. Then we watched a home movie of xmas as janelles in 2001. Funny stuff. Then we went back upstairs and layed around for like an hour and a half. After this we went outside and acted dumb for like a half hour and then her mom picked her up. Now its 10:30 and im tired so im gonna go play some madden then go to bed. Tomorrow i get to hang out with janelle some more, AWESOME! So yea, it was a good day, nothing incredible happening but spending time with janelle is all I need. Update tomorrow night. PEACE!
