End Game  The time is now 8:03pm.  The Heraclitus paper is due in fourteen hours.  Law/Economics paper is in nineteen hours.  I've got about ten pages sitting in front of me for Heraclitus, so I need to reorganize, rewrite, and revise tonight, study for the exam, and help my old friend Suzy with her philosophy paper.    Due to popular request, I will be writing long entries, but this one is an exception.  I've had an exciting day, and perhaps I'll tell you about it later, but for now, there are obstacles to overcome, and freedom to win.
