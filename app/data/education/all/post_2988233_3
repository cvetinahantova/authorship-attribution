God does answer prayers.  I have to tell you, I was having a pretty decent day until I talked to the bank.  Which of course just ruined my day.  Called Tommy to talk to him about it, and ruined his day.  I was really dreading him coming home from work, just because I knew what a bad mood he would be in.    He got home from work, came up to me, put his arms around me, and told me to please bear with him.  He was trying to deal with all the stress and it was taking him a bit to do, but he would keep trying.  Then he just held me.    Praise God, do you know how much I needed that?????????
