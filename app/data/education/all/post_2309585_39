Yessss! Finally some great news! I found rights and royalties info on the show I want to direct next spring for my directing project! I should have a copy of the script in a couple of days.  Good day, spent a lot of time talking and laughing with the theater gals. I've got some serious studying to do for my Christian Home test, based on the study guide he gave us today.  Still got a headache, and still gotta go to Shakespeare class.
