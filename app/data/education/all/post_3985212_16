Well, I'm headed to the Buckeye State. That's right, folks. Ohio here I come!!! I'm going to visit Kimra (as I had said in an earlier post). We're going to have fun without men! Woo hoo! (And don't you go thinking those dirty thoughts, either. Not that kind of fun. Haha.  Well, I'll be gone for a couple days, but when I return, I'm sure I'll have lots to say.  Signing off.....  CUrrent Mood......Excited to see an old friend!
