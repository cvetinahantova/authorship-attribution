I am sunlight captured I am steadfast resistance to weather and man's self-importance  I burst into colors every autumn just to laugh at the joy to be alive  I am host and I am fed by my proximity to the land that feeds me and upon me  I am born of a seed and I die  and am returned to the dance of hosts and hosted  my passing unobtrusive my life many homes but i only noticed the perfection of this space I grew roots in my place  your life expectancies your photo opportunities didn't really matter... they really do not matter to the trees   Â©2002 DC Vision
