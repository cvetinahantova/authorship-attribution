urlLink Infants and Toddlers with Visual Impairments: Suggestions for Early Interventionists. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest was written by Deborah Hatton, R. A. McWilliam, and P. J. Winton.  It examines how parents and educators can help identify and help babies who have vision problems.  From the ERIC Digest:   The intervention needs of infants and toddlers differ considerably from those of children with visual impairments (VI) and blindness who are kindergarten age and older. Early intervention for infants and toddlers should be family-centered while also addressing VI-specific needs. Because significant visual impairments often result in developmental delays and make it difficult to access visual learning environments, infants and toddlers typically qualify for special education services. Exemplary services include the following strategies:  * Establish reliable alliances (Turnbull & Turnbull, 2001) with families and other service providers based upon family and child strengths, respect for diversity and culture, and collaboration.   * Collaborate with families and other professionals to complete the Individualized Family Services Plan (IFSP) process.   * Serve as an effective member of the early intervention team, help families and other team members understand medical information, and be familiar with service coordination responsibilities.   * Approach early intervention from a support, rather than provision of services, perspective.   * Make home visits that promote functional outcomes for both the child and family.
