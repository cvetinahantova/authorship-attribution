I changed my commenting settings back to my old halo scan account. Now anyone can comment. I realized after I went and did this that I could have gone back and made my blogger commenting avialable to anyone. But I had already entered the code and was too lazy to go back and take it out again. So now, anyone may add comments to my posts.  I promise that I will write something more substantial soon. I realize I have been a bit lazy lately with posting. By lazy I mean not posting anything at all in the past 3 weeks. I just don't want to post if I don't have anything mildly interesting to say, even though I do provide the disclaimer that you shouldn't expect me to say anything interesting. I'd hate to turn into my  urlLink old blog  where I'd write stupid posts about how I like grape nuts or my roommates were cooking soemthing with onions. I also don't want to turn into one of those blogs where people try really really really hard to be interesting and so they go into these "deep" tirades that just make them sound like someone off of  My So Called Life . (A really great example of this is a former student in my departments  urlLink page . Unfortunately its been down for about a month now).   So yes, I  promise when I have something not dumb to talk about I will talk about it. Untill then, you all can go back and add comments to all the posts that were commented on post comment change.   urlLink  postCount('109068497112201261');
