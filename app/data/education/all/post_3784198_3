Long relaxed conversations with good friends are much to be savoured. A friend of mine was testing the coherence of my views on religion over a good meal. Basically I was proposing that a person would have a more meaningful life as a  urlLink humanist  than as a christian. Now this might sound rather bold. Mother Teresa? Your neighbour whose faith helped him not to crumble when his wife died? Surely I couldn't be suggesting that all those people would be better off without the beliefs that give their lives purpose? Well, I think that this question depends for its rhetorical force on the implicit comparison between the person with their faith, and that same person bereft of any guiding, inspiring source of passion for life. The implication is that particular individuals wouldn't find purpose without their religious beliefs. But this would be like defending the use of a clapped out old banger to get from A to B on the basis that it is better than walking, when perfectly good vehicular alternatives are on offer. Chesterton is often quoted as saying             "When a man stops believing in God he doesn't then believe in nothing, he believes in anything‚Äù            According to  urlLink Quotemeister , he never quite said this, but the quotation is popular with those who argue that religion is essential. Isn't society in such a mess precisely because it has abandoned the spiritual fundamentals of its culture? Doesn't the abandonment of religion leave a God-shaped gap in your life that nothing else can fill?              Sorry, but I don't think so.         For many, the beliefs they considered essential to their happiness can backfire like an old banger spluttering to a halt on the steep hills of life's road. Abandoning  urlLink Robin Reliant  Christianity does not mean purposeless pedestrianity. There is another way! I feel quite as passionate about my life and purpose now as I ever did, and that without the need for the authority of used-car-salesman assertions.
