Guys, I can't tell you how exhausted I am. I have been working my butt off at school to prepare my room. We have been going through so much info that I don't remember any of the important stuff and all of the stupid stuff. I am so overwhelmed, but for the first time, it is a good overwhelmed. I don't have much to type, except maybe to tell you all that I am finally in the swing of living here and I am loving my new house...no wait...Home!!! I can't wait for all of you to visit. Kellie, I hope you get to see my new abode. Hopefully, I will still be living here when you get back. Anyway, I am going to get back to the grind. I have lots of class procedures to draw up, so later. What did you do today at work???
