Iraq and Spidey By Scott  June 30th, the day that the interim Iraqi government assumes sovereignty, also happens to be opening day for the blockbuster Spiderman 2. Will a Michael Chabon-written screenplay make more millions than Iraq's gluttonous oil fields? It remains to be seen. However, know this: Spidey is for  urlLink justice . What I find ironic is that Spidey is now more American than ever.  I'm sure most Impeccable readers know about the cross-promotional deal Spidey has with Major League baseball. Clips of the movie on scoreboards, Spidey foam finger merchandise at souvenir shops, images of Spidey on the bases at Fenway. Surely the Dirt Dogs can't have a part in this as well. Say it ain't so, Johnny Caveman! Say that dirty advertising money used trying to convert Muslims isn't in your pocket! But it's true.     Iowans and Hoosiers take note, today's a special day in Chicago history: On this day in 1981, Dan Goodwin dons a home-made Spiderman costume, grabs a couple suction cups, and climbs the tallest building in the world, the Sears Tower. It takes Goodwin six hours to perform the stunt, which remains, to this day, the coolest thing ever done by a human being. Goodwin was later arrested for public endangerment. He went to jail in his tights, spent the night with the riffraff, paid 1000 dollars bail in the morning, and was never heard from again. Then, in the summer of 1999, some  urlLink wacky Frenchman  tried his hand at it.
