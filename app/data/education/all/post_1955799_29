Worked on project for web design class today.  I asked the professor if the second web design class uses the same book.  She said that she didn't know because the Marcomedia software is upgrading, which means that there will be new books on that.   I don't know how good that is, but it means I will have to buy new books.  I was going to buy the macromedi software, but that won't happen until January 2004.  I will be working on a Friday (How I hate that), so I'll do what I have to do.  This is a wrinkle in my plans.  LOL.  I wanted to rest more.
