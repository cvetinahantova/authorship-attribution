Well, I'm in a better mood now, and I've decided that I'll just make them give me the keys, so I can at least make something out of the car ride. Anyway, I'll try and update from somewhere during the trip, but it's doubtful.  Anyway, I'm waiting for my laundry to finish, so I can finish packing and go to bed, so I think I'll find something to do for a bit. I might update when I go to bed.
