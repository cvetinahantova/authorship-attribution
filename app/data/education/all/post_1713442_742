urlLink Habitat for Humanity Int'l -- Jimmy Carter and Habitat  Describes the Jimmy Carter Work Project (JCWP) for Habitat for Humanity. The 2002 JCWP in Africa is the largest home-building effort in the history of the 18-year-old event. No matter what you think of the politics and performance in office of President Carter, this is impressive.  From the site:  As President of the United States, Jimmy Carter was deeply committed to social justice and basic human rights. He and his wife Rosalynn left the White House in search of meaningful ways to contribute in these areas. In addition to promoting peace and human rights through the nonprofit Carter Center in Atlanta, they lead the Jimmy Carter Work Project (JCWP) for Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI) one week each year.  Jimmy Carter Work Project  Jimmy Carter's involvement with Habitat for Humanity International began in 1984 when the former president led a work group to New York City to help renovate a six-story building with 19 families in need of decent, affordable shelter. That experience planted the seed, and the Jimmy Carter Work Project has been an internationally recognized event of HFHI ever since.  Each year, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter give a week of their time -- along with their building skills -- to build homes and raise awareness of the critical need for affordable housing. The JCWP is held at a different location each year, and attracts volunteers from around the world. The Carters and more than 4,000 volunteers built 92 houses in Anniston, Ala., and LaGrange and Valdosta, Ga., during JCWP 2003. The 2002 JCWP took place in Africa. One thousand houses were built in 18 countries, with the final 100 houses constructed in a five-day build in Durban, South Africa. In 2001, JCWP built 136 houses at six sites across South Korea with more than 9,000 volunteers participating from around the world. Other recent JCWP builds have taken place in New York-Florida-Georgia (2000--157 houses), the Philippines (1999--293 houses) and Houston, Texas (1998--100 houses). JCWP 2004 is scheduled for two sites in Mexico -- Puebla and Veracruz -- Oct. 24 - 29, 2004.
