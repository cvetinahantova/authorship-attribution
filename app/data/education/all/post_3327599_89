now that i have your attention i can bore you! haha. nothing happened today, and by nothing i mean i lounged around the house in pj pants and cleaned. loads of fun let me tell ya.   everyone has seen charolette's web right? ya know how all the animals are buddy buddy and they talk and stuff.. do you think animals really bond like that? i fed my goats today and a mouse ran out from under the bucket and my dog got it. i took the poor thing away from her and tossed it over the fence.. he was still breathing but wasn't moving.. what if he was friends with my goats? now i feel bad lol. and i think maybe i should up meds for even wondering things like this.. more medication for all!   elephants are much bigger in person...
