you'll never believe what barbie said... ..........................................................  yesterday morning i was chillin with jaelyn, playing with barbies with her (at her request, and yes, i'm mortified that my child even *has* barbies -- don't worry they're at least non-white barbies) when my barbie said, "mommy I think i'm going to run for president this year..."  "girls can't be presidents only boys."  daddy wants to jump out of his skin....what!?!?!....but instead, his barbie calmly climbs up the pillow to gather rhetorical poise, and she says, "girls can too be presidents.  They can be anything they want to be!"  her barbie said: "I don't want to run for president because i need to stay at home and take care of my adopted babies."  now don't get me wrong here, i'm REALLY glad that my daughter has a strong nurturing instinct.  but where did she get this idea...  my barbie says, "why doesn't their daddy take care of them while you're the president?"  "because," she answers matter of factly, "the daddy has to go on trips and i need to stay at home with my honnys."  AHH! i'm never going on a trip again.  Lynn's going on two trips a semester.  How insidious?!?! how pervasive is this gender programming?!!!  (insidious and pervasive are both on the favorite word list.)  on the trip i just took we talked about gender quite a bit  -- and there's a  urlLink dialogue  going in the emergent church circles going on over the last few days....  I made on the trip -- a bold assertion that I'm going to make here again -- i'll only blog about it if it en*genders* (heh,heh, get it?) some interesting feedback....  "Gender (not sex) is in opposition to Cross / Gospel."  And just to ratchet up the inflammatory tone just slightly,  I'll admit that this statement was made as a critique of the promise-keepers movement *&* gay culture (as if there was *just one*)  thems the bait...any interested takers...  i remain...  barbies sworn enemy, but devoted to...  peace~
