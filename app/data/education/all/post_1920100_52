Comfort comes with time...     Camp has been going great! We have a great set of kids. I am writing because their is a girl in my group  named Lorretta she will be going to seventh grade next year. She is only here for a limited time. She is from Taiwan and speaks Chinese. It's been great because I have really been getting to know her and her culture more and more each day. In the beginning it was tuff because she was very shy and would not speak. I tried to make her feel comfortable and was patient with her. Since I knew she didn't understand a lot of English I didn't want her to feel neglected or uncomfortable so I would go around her table and explain the projects to her in a way that was not embarrasing for her or for others to notice. I used a lot of nonverbal cues and offered her support. During lunch time she would sit  quietly alone and not talk to anyone. Now she hangs out with the other girls and joins them. Whenever I am working on a project or doing art she always comes around and observes me. I was really blessed today because during break time we talked the whole time....this is rare comming from her. We just shared about camp and about Taiwan and the differences/similarities. It was great to see the bond being built. I was humbled to know she trusted me and wanted to hang out.  It's amazing how interested in our culture they are. Keep her in prayer that she may continue pursuing cultural awareness and that she will gain confidence for herself.
