urlLink DVD Rentals   I have been considering starting a subscription with Netflix.  This service allows for unlimited home delivery of DVD titles for the fee of $19 a month.  Not bad at all.  And the company has a good reputation for service.  In addition to no late fees, Netflix pays postage both ways for the DVD titles.  However, I like the local video store which is Family Video.  They are not conviently located but they are cheap and have what I want.  Maybe if my only choice was Blockbuster would I go the Netflix route.  But I like the idea of Netflix and may subscribe someday soon anyway.
