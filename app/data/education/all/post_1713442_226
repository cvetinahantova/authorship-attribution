urlLink Library Reference Search - Information Literacy   I am going to highlight another directory that contains a collection of information literacy related links.  The blogged link goes to the information litetracy category at Library Reference Search.  Other categories of note at Library Reference Search:   urlLink Library Instruction   urlLink Evaluation of Web Sites   urlLink Skeptical Inquiry and Critical Thinking   urlLink Literacy and Information Literacy   Ignore the part of each page which reads "Featured Web Pages."  These are ads in disguise.  Everything else looks to be legitimate.
