Awakened by the sound of retreating sun and advancing moon,     A tired soul lies silent in the throes of time, Staring blankly with tear-rimmed eyes into a future     Filled with familiar strangers that know him all too well. A thousand voices fading haunt him from behind,     Yet nonexistant sounds of hope ring clear from tomorrow's hill. The same stroke of three hundred and sixty-four midnights     Moves mountains this night; And a moment sends ripples across a mirror lake,     Smoothed by time and unchanged by human nature- Tears peircing the reflection of myself.
