http://www.childrens-games.org/results_frame.html?event=baseball_boys.html  You can go to the website and get updates on the games.  We found out last night that the team was supposed to be on Good Morning America today but I have not been able to watch it here at work.    But I have set it up to tape at home.  As soon as Adam calls me I will update everyone.
