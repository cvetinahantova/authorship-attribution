You know it's really weird how time works, when you're little it seems like FOREVER for a year to pass, and once you get a little older they fly by.  I probably wouldn't notice it that much but, I've now been at a job I don't like for over a year (it really was only suppose to be temporary) and another training week has passed.  At the end of each training week I add a class photo to my notebook so I can keep track of who is who and when they came to training.  It is VERY helpful.  After 24 training classes it tend to forget who everyone is.  And wow 24 is a lot.  I just counted them, I didn't realize I had done that many, no wonder I have become numb to it.  Numb to the monotony of each week.  And it's already July meaning the summer is almost 1/2 way over as well.  It's a weird feeling thinking about how much time has passed and I haven't accomplished that much.  Hummmmm, I don't really like this feeling so I'm going to change the subject.  It's Friday and yet again I am left without plans!  Stupid LR, I move here and no one wants to go out anymore!  Oh well.  I'm trying to see if I can make some plans with my friend Carrie, I haven't hung out with her in a long while so I'd like to visit with her.  And my roommate is sick with tonsillitis and a spider bit...eek.  My other roommate is bogged down with a summer Bio class (BLAH), and will probably be working tonight.  Hummm......so not really sure of plans, although I truthfully would be fine with just hangin out at home watching a movie.  I don't know I'm just in one of those moods you know.  Which means I probably DON'T need to be staying at home, because then that will be all I want to do......it get into little funks sometimes, and the only way to get out of them is to be around other people, but once I am in one I don't want to.  It's a horrible cycle.  LOL.  Ok well I'm going to try and do some work........hahaha, no Iâ€™m not!! I'm going to talk on aim and probably shop for shoes online!! MUHAHAHAHAHA
