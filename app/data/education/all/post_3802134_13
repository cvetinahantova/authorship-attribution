I finally finished  Wolves of the Calla, The Dark Tower Vol. 5  by Stephen King a couple days ago.  It took me a while to get going in it for some reason, but once I was moving I had a hard time stopping.  I sat in the bathtub for 45 minutes one night as the water got colder and colder because I was so close to the end, and I couldn't stop long enough to wash my hair.  My favorite parts of the series involve the characters travelling back and forth between the gunslinger's world and our world, and there was a lot of that going on here.  Possibly  my favorite of the series so far.  It's  toss-up between this one and  The Drawing of the Three (Vol. 2) .  There are occasionally things and ideas that don't quite work, but overall The Dark Tower series is such a creative amalgamation of different genres that it's tough for me to not like it.  This one definitely owed something to  The Magnificent Seven  which King is kind enough to admit unlike J.K. "I Swear I've Never Read Tolkien In My Life And He's Had No Influence On Me Whatsoever" Rowling.  (Don't get me wrong, I love the Harry Potter books, but I have a hard time believing this because sometimes her ideas are SO close to Tolkein's stuff.  It's become kind of an inside joke between Mark and I.)  So 47 books down, 78 to go if I want to meet my original goal of 125 for the year.  It doesn't look good, I gotta say.  I was hoping to read a lot more while I was off, but in those two weeks I only read two books.  Next up:  My Sister's Keeper  by Jodi Picoult and  Quirky QWERTY: A Biography of the Typewriter and Its Many Characters  by Torbjorn Lundmark.  I've already started  Apostles of Rock: The Splintered World of Contemporary Christian Rock  by Jay R. Howard and John M. Streck, but it's heavier reading so I'm trying to read some lighter stuff at the same time.  Now playing:  Everywhere I Look  by Phil Keaggy
