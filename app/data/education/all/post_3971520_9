Well, I must say that this has been a really hard week. I have had a whirlwind of emotions to deal with and I just can't even begin to tell you just how hard this week has been for me. Lornaland is getting brighter everday, though, so do not worry about me too much. Mom and I have decided that talking with my doctor about some anxiety medication might be a good thing. I probably could have benefitted from such medications several years ago. We all know that I get easily overwhelmed by anxiety and it does put a strain on my life in all aspects. I am not much on doing this sort of thing, so I would like your support, if you are willing to give me some input or share your own experiences with related problems, etc.  Anyway, today is a good day for me and I only freaked out a little bit last night, so all in all I am going great today. I am at my empty house right now and it is feeling a lot like home. Nothing compared to Momma's house, but home for me during the week. Thank you for all of your prayers because prayer has been hard for me this week. I love you all.
