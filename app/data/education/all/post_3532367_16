Well it didn't really seem to work. When I got into bed, Sandra offered me sex on the same basis as last night. I refused, she pushed and I refused again. It would have been so easy, but I knew there would have been a low on the other side of it.  I woke at 02:30 and again at 04:00 and again at 06:00, but I was not awake enough, so there was no way I was going to get up and go for a run. At 06:00 I started to give her cuddles and hugs which inevitably led to me trying it on, which she rebuffed. I recognised what I was doing, apologised and tried to remind her that I was trying, but it was hard for me. When we got up, I asked if she had slept OK, she said not that well and returned the question. When I told her I had woken several times, her response was "well I gave you the opportunity".....Aarrgh!  Sandra thinks I am using the depression label as an excuse for all of my problems, sometimes she almost seems jealous that I am getting help and she isn't, but she won't do anything about it.
