June 10,2014   Dear Familia,            Hola! Como estan? I'v been missing you for the last few years. I am writing to you para decirles que life is great hear in cali. Your grandchildren keep asking about you. They can't wait to see you. Being a nurse is kind of difficult for me. Whenever I see those children sick, my heart just breaks apart. Sometimes I think about it and I ask myself what if my children were as sick as these innocent little kids? I am not trying to think about this anymore. So wat I'm going to do is take some time off and go to mexico for the summer. I'll be waiting here for you with opened hands. Hope to see you soon.                                           Love,                                                Nancy
