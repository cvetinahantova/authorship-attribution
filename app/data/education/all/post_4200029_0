PhD factor for today: 2.0 (on a scale from 0 to 10)  So, it's been a less mentally productive week so far. The thing about mentally unproductive weeks is that I still think--I'm just not thinking about what I'm supposed to be thinking about (ad-hoc networks and so on.)  It would be nice to have a job where I was just paid to think about whatever I felt like thinking about. I suppose that'd be something like a cross between an artist, a consultant, and a psych ward patient.  Really, it's starting to get to the point where I'd just like to have an income.
