Ah, Today is the day. My Mom and I leave for the Port of Los Angeles at around 9. There was a fatal accident on the 5 southbound this morning, but I'm pretty sure the freeway is open again. If it isn't then we are really screwed. Anyway, I'll probably post on or around the 6th, or maybe even on the boat. 25 cents a minute though, oh well. Later..... Mwahahahaha... I hope the boat doesn't sink......
