Okay, so we have 12.5 more days of school. Not too much. But for the rest of the stupid week we have high school assesments. I mean, I only have to take 2 of them, but they make asses outta our schedules and I have to spend almost 2 freakin hours a day in french class! Ahhh I like the english language thank you very much. Thats just too much freakin francais!  Well this morning on the 50 minute bus ride to school, I sat in the back with Johnny, and Justine (my ex-best friend who has had a boyfriend for like 2 years but is suddenly jealous that Johnny likes me and she cant do anything about it) started bitchin like mad. I just wanted to punch her in her fucking face. So natuarally we started bitchin and cussin up a storm at each other. It wuz crazyness. But then Johnny told her that we are going out and well she got even more pissed off, and at that point it wuz just halarious and I still wanted to punch her, but this time just cause shes a bitch, not because we were fighting anymore.   OH NO! I HAVE TO GO... I WILL FINISH THIS TONIGHT SOMETIME. IM GOING TO SEE JOHNNY!!!!!   ***LOVES YAS ME!!***
