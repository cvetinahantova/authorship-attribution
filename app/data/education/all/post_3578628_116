Yea most of it just has to do with communication.  Just telling people who's coming, yea, sometimes bothers me.  I think when it's someone unexpected (outside the "group") it's just hard to grasp.  Sometimes its hard to know if we're going to cause a problem by bringing something up, etc.  I don't care if you watch the Daily Show, believe Micheal Moore, etc.; that's your choice.  Nobody said that I would agree with it.  Respect is a big deal and will get you a long way in life.  I may not agree with what people think or say, but I have to have an open mind and respect that opinion.  When it comes to someone's opinions about a subject, even the   President, of course I don't agree with some of those opinions, but I don't take that as a personal attack.  I think that's what you end up doing sometimes Kev.  I don't think you mean to, but when someone has a different opinion, you take it personally especially on the blog.  I think that's what you see in my eyes that is frustrating to me about you.  The thing is, though, you can't get upset.  It's too hard to worry about what's different about everybody.  It's not worth it.  You have to compromise and have fun.  You just have to live on and respect other people.  That way you can have some fun with friends and not have to worry about everyone getting upset over simple disagreements.
