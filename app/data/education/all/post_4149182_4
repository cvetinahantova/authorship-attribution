Ahh! Bored. So bored.  My allergies are almost gone... and I went to go buy  Return Engagement . But guess what? They had it in stock... but not on shelves. WHAT THE HELL!? Damn Chapters.  I had a dream last night. It wasn't a pleasant dream. It was about the first day of school... and it was realistic, unlike most of my dreams. Courtney was there. She looked... exactly like real life. She looked... good. But guess what? She didn't say a word to me in the entire thing. Ever. She didn't even meet my eyes. It was creepy. It was realistic.  I hated it.  I'm really thinking about her too much. After what she did to me, why should I? She deserves  punishment . God damn it, I want revenge! But I also want to forgive her, not matter what happens. Turn the other cheek, if you will. But, it's pretty damn hard to do. Jesus had it right, but he didn't give any pointers!  Damn her.  I also have the nasty feeling that when I get back to school, there are going to be massive "social" consequences from this (even though that bitch sneers at consequences). She's probably going to do the typical chick thing and get all her friends to hate me for doing something genuinely nice and humble. Fuck, but does the world ever suck. Damn her.  Arg. I should shut up about that.  "And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue and the man in the moon, when you coming home, son I don't know when, we'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then."
