urlLink  REM's   new album is called  Around The Sun  and it's out on Oct 5. The single is "Leaving New York" - gee, what is that about?!    urlLink Simple Minds   are old enough to have a 5 disc box set called   urlLink Silver Box   that has no previously released material. Good Lord. For the hardcore fans - are they called  simpletons?     urlLink The Blue Nile's   album includes the beautiful song "Soul Boy" that Paul wrote for Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) - the only good song on her last (and last?) album. More  urlLink here , from a fan    urlLink Kirsty MacColl   finally gets a 3 CD box set. The tracklist (you have to go through 3 screens starting with  urlLink this link ) covers everything important, plus tons of rarities. I still am sad that she died.
