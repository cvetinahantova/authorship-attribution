Things seem a little quieter at work this week. After running round like a tit, all last week it comes as a refreshing relief and has allowed me to catch up on important things like blogging!  I've still got my sick note and it seems to be helping me to cope (knowing I've got a saftey net I suppose). I've also just had an email from Angela and it looks as though she will be home early due to the bad weather, so that in itself is a help. I would love to get over and see her before the weekend, so fingers crossed.
