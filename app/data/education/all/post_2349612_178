so, i've emailed last summer's boss to see if she'll rehire me to "telecommute" for the summer... we'll see if this works.  mom called, approves of all the road trips and also wanted to let me know... dad ended up turning down the ohio job offer b/c it was too administrative for his tastes, but apparently some commercial land developer is considering buying our property.  dad named a price of 3 times what he and mom paid for it, and the developer said he'd come back with an offer in the next 30 days.  dad went and talked to one of his real estate friends who drew up a contract for said amount and said if this developer doesn't take it, he'll sell it for that amount to someone else, be ready to move in the next 30 days... dad said 30 days notice is impossible w/ all the animals and stuff, so his friend said, then he can get him 90 days at best, but be ready to be outta there anytime.  this means i probably won't ever get to visit the house i grew up in ever again. (it's so decrepit it'll most likely get bulldozed)... this makes me sad.  analysis makes me sad too.  after our miserable algebra class, i worked on analysis from 11:30 straight til 1, had lunch with eric at subway, then worked straight from 2 til 6:30 again... still not all the way done and need to write up all kinds of junk... i'm in a tired, grumpy, bad attitude all around kinda mood, so i told leigh if anyone figures out the last part of a problem we don't know how to do, call me, otherwise i'll keep my bad attitude to myself for the evening... and that's exactly what i plan to do.  later.
