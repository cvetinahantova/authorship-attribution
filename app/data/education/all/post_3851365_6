This is the handwritten letter Wendy brought down to me, after our talk.    Dear Mom   I would like to say, I am really sorry for what happened.   I suffered alot after being depressed.  So I am so happy, I feel I can get away with too much.   I was vain.  I was very impatient.  I wanted my hobbie to work.  I have "friends" on the other side.   They tell me I can get friends in the real world - they see me for who I am.   So I talk to them alot.  I asked them to give me power.   I am very upset I hurt you.  I only tried to help myself.    I want other friends.  Very bad.  But you seem to be the only one who cares.   I should not have let this out on you.  I am strong, and will make more friends.  I am shy, thus I need help from the other side.   Only under your supervision will I ever succeed in any thing I do.   Wendy
