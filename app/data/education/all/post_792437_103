Is it too much to ask??    Â  I guess I can be a demanding person from my friends and others. But I have a few expectations..but yet I put them off on the side..should I do that? Is that right? I mean, is that changing myself to fit the personality of others? There are some things or more than some I expect, but yet I choose to ignore them...does that mean I'm lying to myself and not being the true me? Or am I just becoming more accomodating to others??hmmm..I'm confused..
