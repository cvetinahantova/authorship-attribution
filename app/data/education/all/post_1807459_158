So I've already designated the best dollar I ever spent (that was on the haircut in Saigon).  But the best $6 I ever spent might have been on my island tour today in Nha Trang.  Not only did we get to go around to 4 different islands but breakfast, lunch and an afternoon fruit buffet snack were included.  Too boot the food was great.  And when it could get better they broke out the floating bar.  It wasn't really a bar so to speak, just a little Vietnamese guy in a raft/tub thing pouring red wine for people while we floated around in our tubes.  It was pretty darn awesome.  My favorite part would be the snorkling at the first island.  I haven't been snorkling since Malaysia which was almost a year ago (but seems like yesterday).  Vietnam has some great coral reefs and marine life.  I love those really colorful fishies.  So now I'm back and chilling.  I don't know what I'll do tonight.  I'm tempted to go hang out and have a beer but I'm pretty tired and I have a killer 11 hour bus ride tomorrow.  That's gonna suck.   This trip is turning out to be all and more then what I could have imagined.  And I think I'm finally begining to get a hold on what I want to do with my life and finally getting the motivation to do it.  At least I hope.  Another month or so will tell for sure.  Ok I have to find somewhere to change money or an atm b/c I think I need to eat.
