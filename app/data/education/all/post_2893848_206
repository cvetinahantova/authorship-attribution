A Not So Brief Hiatus   Tomorrow will be the first day of my European tour, even if it will only bring me to Minnesota, where we will drop off the dog with Adrienne's parents and later fly fly fly to Hungary.  I'll try to post in between bowls of goulash and other cultural wonders, but who knows how possible that will be.  I'll be back for sure on June 12th.    The good news is that Scott has agreed to pick up the impeccable slack, and I'd like to take this opportunity to ask Drew to post more in these coming weeks as well.  But go easy on these guys; they actually have jobs.    Have an impeccable couple weeks, impeccable masses (dozens).
