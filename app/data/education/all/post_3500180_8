After an almost-four-hour drive, I'm  finally in Toronto. Ride was boring, fell asleep.... yah.. We visited the friend who is moving to Saskatoon (yes, correction. NOT Alberta, Saskatoon). I just sat there while my parents and them talked.. wooo, fun.. -_-  Well, I am going to Chinatown soon. That's good. I haven't been there for so long now. I don't know if that's a good thing... I don't know a lot of things, do I...? I wanna go to Chapters again... Books, lots of books. Lots of good books. ^_^ I am tired... *yawns*  Okay, I must go. Bid you all a happy farewell.  P.S. I use "..." a lot.... See? There it goes again... And again... and again... Okay, I'll stop.... Oops... again!!!! There. It ended. Hee... >_
