A fellow blogger that I found through an index called Blogs4God wrote the following.    "I'm convinced that my blog readership would increase greatly if I worked in a bar or a pornography establishment. Or, perhaps, if I were gay. It seems that sex and alcohol are the primo subjects to blog."    I tried to post my response to his comments section but I was too long winded to fit it all in there. So I told him to come here , to my blog , to read my comments in their entirety.     You are correct.  If you were posting comments from the viewpoint of the world then your readership would increase ten fold.  Then again we as Christians are not of this world.  We are different.  Atleast that is what my bible tells me. We have been redeemed and restored. We are to be the salt of the earth and light of the world.  We are not supposed to be like everyone else. We are supposed to bring flavor to those around us and we are to intrigue others because of our lifestyle choices.  Sometimes that intrigue turns out to be something that repels people instead of attracting them.  Nevertheless God uses who He is in us to reach out to the community that HE has placed us in.  We might think that we are just a common Joe with common lives that no one is interested in.  Take heart and know that people are watching and see the real you even when you are not watching.  When we gave our hearts to God and said "I will follow you" we rejected the things of this world and embraced the kingdom of God.  That means that the things of this world really do not have an appeal to us anymore.  Amen?  Do we really want to be a part of the worlds social scene any longer?  Of course not, those things are temporal and unfullfilling.  The reason for that is because there is very little value.  Gosh, I feel as if I am preaching here and that is not my intent.  I just want to encourage you to know that your life makes a huge difference in the grand scheme of things. You may not be in lights per say and your blog readership may be minimal.  Its not who we are or what we can accomplish or who can notice us but rather what God can do through us.  When we are weak and inadequate that is when HE can do his perfect work through us.  Keep on Keeping on for Christ my brother.           James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net
