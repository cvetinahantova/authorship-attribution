Subject: Just Because....T. D. Jakes     Just because someone may not have realized what a gold  mine you are,  doesn't mean you shine any less.  Just because someone may not have realized that you can't be topped, doesn't stop you from being the best.  Just because no one has come along to share your life,  doesn't mean that day isn't coming.  Just because no one has made this race worthwhile, doesn't  give you permission to stop running.  Just because no one has realized how much of an awesome woman you are, doesn't mean they can affect your femininity.  Just because no one has shown up who can love you on  your level, doesn't mean you have to sink to theirs.  Just because you deserve the very best there is, doesn't mean that life is always fair. Just because God is still preparing your king, doesn't mean that you're not  already a Queen.  Just because your situation doesn't seem to be progressing right now,  doesn't mean you need to change a thing. Keep shining,  Keep running, Keep hoping, Keep praying, Keep being exactly what you are  already . .  COMPLETE!!
