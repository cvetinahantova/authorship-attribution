I just want to say, before the signs of the time approach, that I think  urlLink Six Apart  has shot themselves in the foot with  urlLink MT 3.0  and  urlLink TypeKey .  I'm glad I dropped MT now. No regrets at all...  We now return you to your not-so-regular blogging. (Thanks,  urlLink Google )
