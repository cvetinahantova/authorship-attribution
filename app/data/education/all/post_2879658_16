China      Hey everyone, I wanted to post about some of the recent events but unfortunately haven`t had the chance.  When I return from China I will do my best to update you on Steph`s bday celebration and how boys will be boys...   Now I just wanted to let you know that on Thursday I will be heading to China and will not return to Japan until the 10th of May.  Elizabeth and I have been watching the news and are fully aware of the recent SARS outbreak and will definitely be taking the necessary precautions.  I am really excited and can`t wait to share some of the details upon my return to Japan.  Hope everything is well with all of you!
