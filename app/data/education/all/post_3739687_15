hey folks,  well i had to sub for the music teacher today.  ya'll would have loved seeing me trying to sing "three blind mice" and "old MacDonald had a farm" to the first graders.  it was hilarious.  one good thing about teaching kids is that they love it when the teacher acts silly.  also, it makes them pay attention.  so i quacked like a duck, oinked like a pig, and everything else.  the kids are soooo smart they pick up on everything i say and do.  it's really amazing to see how fast their brains can work.  however the older ones are a different story.  they are going through puberty and can be real bitches.  anyway... i didn't have to teach them music lessons.  they just had to do an extra english lesson.  i made the handout extremely difficult so it would take most of the class time for them to complete it.   gosh i'm a mean teacher.  jk.  also, i went to an art opening last night.  it was interesting.  the work was patchwork tapestries done with thai silk and various other fabrics.  of course the ones i liked were sold, but i'm not in the 12,000 baht income range anyway.  wish i were i would have loved to own one of his works.  also, wish i could remember the artist's name.  i'll try and find out.  he's having an opening in nyc next month.  other than that there's not much to say.  i'm going to a party tonight.  nancy, another girl i work with, is having people over.  she's from virginia and very cool.  also, she's a great teacher.  i'm forcing her to help me be more effective with the kids.  i'm determined to make a difference.  hopefully my dedication will survive the neurotic nuns who are trying to  keep me down.  jane
