We all knew that the Post was a poor excuse for a newspaper, but this is the worst ever. On information from some poorly informed sources, the Post had to be first to announce that John Kerry had chosen a running mate, which he did, and that the running mate was Dick Gephardt, which it isn't.  This is as egregious the Dewey defeats Truman error in that Chicago newspaper back in the '40s.  The Post should be ashmed of themselves, though I doubt they are, and they should issue apology after apology for looking like the idiots that they are.  I wonder if Kerry heard about this report, and then changed his mind, just to make the paper look dumb.  That would be funny, but I doubt it.  Long live the  urlLink Daily News .
