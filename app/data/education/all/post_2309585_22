Last night was fun. Steph showed up at my house around nine, and we went out for coffee until the coffeehouse closed at midnight. Then I kinda tossed for an hour or so before drifting off. Dad woke me up at 6 this morning, calling to tell me he was proud of me. Never got back to sleep after that.  So it's 11:00 now. So far, I've been to Chapel (I'm getting too old for that long walk up to the upper balcony),  and bought books (I charged them to the business office, so when my financial aid finally comes through, they'll take it out of there). And good God, if there's not a kajillion pounds worth of books there. I had to lug them down to the checkout area of the bookstore in a cardboard box, and bought a messenger bag (acid green!) just so I had something to lug them around in today. Yeesh.  First class starts in 2 hours. Afterwards, I have 10 minutes to hike alllll the way across campus to get to my next class.  So far, so good, I guess.
