Recently rock sensation Bruce Springsteen compiled a list of 19 bands that will be touring along with him in key states of 2004's political campaign including states such as WI, FL, and OH supporting John Kerry/Edwards.  Some of the bands to be included in this event entitled "Vote For Change" are Pearl Jam, R.E.M., and The Dave Matthews Band.   I as a supporter of John Kerry, through the Brown County Young Democrats, plan to attend the concert when it hits my home state of Wisconsin.  Thought I would just fill you in on this.  GO JOHN KERRY/EDWARDS.  Thank you and may god bless you.
