urlLink Assessing the Effectiveness of Problem Based Learning in Higher Education: Lessons from the Literature  I have complained how difficult I find assessment before here.  I am always happy to find good articles which look at this difficult topic.  The blogged site of the day is a literature review on the subject from  Academic Exchange Quarterly .  It focuses on problem-based learning in higher education but is certainly applicable for librarian/teachers at all levels.  Abstract:  "Problem‑Based Learning (PBL) is an innovative educational approach that is gaining prominence in higher education. A review of the literature of PBL outcomes summarizes, across multiple studies, the positive effects of problem‑based learning. Since PBL brings with it unique challenges to traditional assessment, however, this study suggests alternative approaches. Alternative assessment may provide additional insight into the effectiveness of PBL and other alternative pedagogies."
