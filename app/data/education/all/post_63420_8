Found a new set of web tools that I'll be using on some sites I'm working on.  urlLink Bravenet.com  seems to feature a lot of stuff that can be embedded in your own pages and also services (often free) for hosting other features.  Add a customizable e-mail contact page (for example) rather than planting a harvestable e-mail URL, put audio clips on your site, download some scripts, etc.
