This is so rigoddamndiculous. How many times do I have to write people before I get an answer. How irresponsible must our administrations be. It's one thing not to agree with me, but at least hear what I have to say and have the decency to reply back. I have sent many letters and e-mails to the Superintendent, Asst. Superintendents, our Principal, Asst. Principals, Board Members, do any of them respond, No. It is absolutely rigoddamndiculous. And don't think they have heard the last from me, they are still working, and I have no problem going down to the board office and requesting a face to face meeting.
