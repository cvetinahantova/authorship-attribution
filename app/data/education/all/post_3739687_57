hello,  well things have been going great here.  i'm really enjoying thailand.   yesterday and today are some big buddhist holiday so eveyone seems to be  smilling even more than they do regularly.  i can't remember the name of the  holiday.  i really need to get another book on thailand.  i've read one but  it was just a historical narrative that explained why thailand was never  colonized.  anyway...  i went to soi 4 last night but they weren't serving alcohol because of the  holiday.  which worked out great for me because i'm trying to drink less.   i've figured out that if you don't drink it is easy to save money here.   well you can't save much but it will certainly make the ends meet.  thailand is becoming more and more familiar to me.  i think i could be here  for ages and never know everything but i'm starting to recognize more and  more.  the fruit vendor on the end of my soi (street) recognizes me and  teaches me a new thai word every time i buy fruit from him.  i feel so  healthy here.  i work out at my gym, eat fruit and som tam, spicy papaya  salad that still sets my mouth on fire, also i walk almost everywhere.  if  it wasn't so polluted here it would be paradise.  unfortunaley the pollution  can almost be unbearable at times.  i especailly hate it when i'm eating at  my favorite tofu street vendor and a tuk-tuk comes by blowing carbon  monozide right at me.  ugh!  other than that i've just been chillin' out with friends at the pool and  trying to make myself do work for school.  i actually went in yesterday but  not today.  sister erlinda was so surprised to see me that she didn't even  say anything about my shoulders not being covered.  wow. anyway... i didn't  know on our days off we still had to abid by all the rules.  crazy  catholics.  jk.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Discover the best of the best at MSN Luxury Living. http://lexus.msn.com/
