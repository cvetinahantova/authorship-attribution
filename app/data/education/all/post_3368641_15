We all die alone, going with ease or fighting all the way, into the unknowable, yet often surmised mystery of death.  No one may be known completely, even our closest confidants never truly sharing the private thoughts the separate moments that makes us singularities.  We all die alone anxious for a witness, with proof of our existence in the final fact...  that we are not alone in our yearning.  Â©2003 DC Vision
