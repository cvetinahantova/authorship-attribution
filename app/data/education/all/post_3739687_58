hello,  well i woke up yesterday with a sore throat and instead of being a good girl  and staying in last night i decided to still go to soi 4.  btw soi means  street.  anyway... as you can imagine it was awful when i woke up this  morning.  i don't really feel bad it's just annoying.  so now i'm not going  to be able to make it to a friends gig tonight.  i really wanted to go  because this is the third time that he's invited me to see his band play,  but i just don't think i should.  anyway... today i stocked up on orange juice, ice cream, yougurt, and fruit  so i can be sure to get all of my vitamins.  i also layed out for a couple  of hours to try and sweat any tokins out.  hopefully tomorrow i'll be back  to 100%.  well gotta run.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
