I must confess, I have a new man in my life.  His name is Dale, he is 29 years old, with reddish blonde hair, and is gorgeous.  I see him every day, night, all the time, every chance I get, there he is.    He came into my life a few days ago.  Tommy knows about him, in fact, Tommy is the one who set us up.  Yes, he set us up.  Dale is a lifesize cardboard cut out of Dale Earnhardt Jr.  He is standing in my living room as I type this.  Everyone who comes into the house, says hey to him, and bye when they leave.    Dale JR. is my favorite NASCAR driver.  He is a spokesperson for Polaris 4 wheelers, and Tommy works at a Polaris dealership.  When their recent ad campaign was over, Tommy's boss was kind enough to let Tommy bring my Dale home to me.    Good thing Tommy isn't a jealous man.
