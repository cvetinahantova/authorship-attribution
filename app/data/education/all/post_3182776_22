These are the things I have done today which aren't work.  1) Went to Tesco's 2) Ran 6 miles or so. 3) Called my mum and dad, sister, Hav (twice). 4) Won the treble (League, FA cup and Champion's League) on Fifa Soccer on World Class setting. 5) Developed killer concept for off-the-wall post-ironic superhero comic book.   A blockage has developed between my neural doo-dahs and my wotsit cortex which prevents me physically from doing any work. It's a disease! Do you think I can get mitigating circumstances and an extension?  In a slightly scary but still very exciting development, me and Hav have decided to bring the wedding of the century (OURS, you arse) forward a year. Yes that's right, it's THIS SUMMER! Using the sort of logic only we can employ, we have decided that it's less stressful this way. There was a whole thought process behind this but it is quite retarded and schizophrenic, so let's just say that we couldn't wait any longer. We couldn't, anyway. So put your holiday plans on hold, folks. Start your diet, look out for a hat, find your dancing shoes and your best underwear, cos an invitation may just be winging it's way to you sometime soon. If we don't have a nervous breakdown before the day comes round, it'll probably be pretty good fun.  6) Wrote this blog.  Later. x.
