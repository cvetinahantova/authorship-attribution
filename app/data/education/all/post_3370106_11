I discovered something about myself the other night on the car ride home from a wonderful wedding in Kalamazoo...I'm afraid of liberation, of accepting joy, of opening my heart completely...but, everyday it is part of my prayers...let my heart be open and accepting of a spirit of joy.  My intent and my conscious will are focused on eternal light/energy/personal cosmic transformative force, ebbing and flowing, but always growing, expanding, engulfing the chasms that were created to keep myself from myself.  Bridges, built to withstand any soulquake, divine light is present in every structure, both animate and inanimate.  Diversity is nothing but different aspects of the eternal one, only meant to bring interest and humor while we're looking past into the fire of life, making a home there, pondering ancient truths with scientific techniques connected back through the ages.  I thank those who came before me, those whose lives, wills, being, were entirely focused on the everpresent eternal, their commitment has laid bare the path before me...may I approach fully aware, each day a step toward yoga.
