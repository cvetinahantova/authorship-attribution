Well apparently something came over me today. I feel more...free. Lol its like memories that circled the mountains finally reached upon its peak and extinguished through thin air, of course with the help of the ever lasting strong wind that help me blew it away,The breathe of God and his infinite love for me and all, was indeed that wind that I needed so much. Now he has created a new mountain of memories for me to begin with, the memories of my friends and family. Well anyway coming back to reality, today I practically failed my both A-maths mini test for I forgot to study for them...or more like had a mental block, anyway that ain't inportant for now, at least I know where I stand and work for better grades. I'm so glad I was able to help a councillor friend today, hope I made things better for'em all. Had a good meal, grapes and now I'm heading off to theÂ chatroom. Peace out ya'll.
