Ahh... Friday. The last weekday for the hols. The day that i always look forward to. But not this friday. This friday brings me worries, shortage of time and dreadfulness. Relatives from Penang gona reach KL by 5 in the morning.. OMG!!! Freakin early.. And after that... Off to Genting. My so-called 2nd home. Owned by my so-called Uncle Goh Tong. Freakin boring goin to Genting. My parents wana watch some concert up there. I practically live there. Ask me any shops u wana go, any route you wana know.. Ill take you there. Its like the Marauder's Map of Genting in my head. I know all the shortcuts there as well. All the fun stuff up there also played like a hundred times already. So... BORING!!!  I was talkin bout exams with a friend jus now. Apparently, this friend of mine was kinda frustrated when it screwed up. Im pretty sure you guys know how it feels.. You made an effort to do well. Studied hard. Did your revision. And then suddenly, the paper really cracks your head. Keep on pressing your head to figure out the answers. At the end of the exam, you feel kinda disappointed because all your hard work goes down the drain. Then, this is the time when you get really pissed. Well, of my opinion, it doesn't goes down the drain. In fact, you should feel happy even though you don't get good results because you know very well that you studied. And you feel proud that you actually made an effort. You study for yourself. Not for your parents or teachers. School is to gain knowledge for future use. The stupid Malaysian education system made it look like we study to excel in exams. Makin us like book slaves.  Thats all for now... Just wana update everyday while i can. Don think i will be updating anytime this weekend. If i do, oh wellz.. its good then. Enjoy yer hols while you still can. Not gona last long... Fook out...
