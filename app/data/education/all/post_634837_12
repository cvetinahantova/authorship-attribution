A cup of rose tea   Buds of roses unceremoniously thrown into the cavernous belly of porcelain. I think of every coming pleasure with a thought that never unwinds itself. A long, drawn out desire plays itself out in my daily actions of filling my teapot with rose buds, applying the pressure to release the hot water, waiting and waiting.  one day i waited far too long. i returned to see a stain of red at the base of my cup.  it was like a piece of red string tied around my finger from my grandfather's funeral.  The desire for life always plays itself out and the day  is already spent.
