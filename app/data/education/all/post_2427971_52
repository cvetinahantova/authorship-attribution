soo, back from nates for a couple weeks... kicked ass, was really nice to see him again and his gf is nice. played games and got no sleep, drank soda and ate food.. the usual. missed my ride there so i had to take the bus, awful 6 hour ride. then there was the LAN, it sucked... i had no energy and was sick the whole time, big mistake i made by going. a bunch of stupid shit and stuff... then the ride back was fine, just felt the same. whatever, im home.. for a little.. then i get to take a fucking bus to medford tomorrow. sick of this i am.
