I know how you all feel about news being posted.  Truth is... I don't care.  On this page now, I have posted what is a picture of a normal American citizen being held at gunpoint.  He will be killed in 72 hours unless al Qaeda prisoners are let go.  He also wants Westerners to leave the area now.  Saudi Arabia does have a policy of not negotiating with terrorists.  But God willing, the country hopes to do whatever they can to return him to his family safely.  "We have our legal right to treat [hostages] the same way they treat our people," it added. "We will publish more details about the man kidnapped and explain the mujahedeen's demands."  Apparently, the crown  prince said not fighting back would be against the Saudis religion.   For people like Ambur, I understand that this posting is already too long.  And I am deeply sorry, but for the family of this American, I urge you to stay tuned to this story.  Do it to understand the type of terror that exists.  And above all, God bless our troops.   Here's the most recent  urlLink Article  for all who care!
