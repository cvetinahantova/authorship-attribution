This will probably be the first of several comments/quotations from this book by John Mark Hicks and Greg Taylor (Leafwood Publishers, 2003).  Anyway, here's a gem from Martin Luther:  "Your baptism is nothing less than grace clutching you by the throat: a grace-full throttling, by which your sin is submerged in order that ye may remain under grace.  Come thus to thy baptism.  Give thyself up to be drowned in baptism and killed by the mercy of thy dear God, saying: 'Drown me and throttle me, dear Lord, for henceforth I will gladly die to sin with thy Son.'"  More later...
