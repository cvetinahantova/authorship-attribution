I'm sure I'm not the first one to posit this theory, but it seems to me that America's fondness for disaster and apocalypse movies, such as the about-to-open destruct-o-rama,  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow,  is akin to getting off on being spanked. In other words, as an adolescent nation we sublimate our guilty knowledge that we are too wealthy, too powerful, and eating too big a piece of the world's pie. That repressed knowledge manifests itself in a desire to see our cities flooded by tidal waves, destroyed by earthquakes, invaded by aliens, and the like. We've been a very naughty nation. Ooh, it hurts so good!  One would think that in the Post 9/11 world, this sort of sanctioned, masochistic pleasure-seeking would ebb a bit. For awhile, it seemed to. But I'm guessing Americans will throng to the theaters this weekend, salivating and slightly aroused, to watch America be destroyed (by global warming, no less) in glorious technicolor. The same way we glued ourselves to our TVs for hours on end on 9/11. Did we really need to keep seeing the planes crash into the towers, the people hurling themselves from the windows, the buildings collapsing, again and again? No, but we watched anyway. I did, too. And part of me would love to go to the theater this weekend and see a tidal wave take out Manhattan.  Somehow I suspect that if I were French (or Indian, or Korean, or Polish, or Rwandan, etc.), I wouldn't feel this way. If I were Canadian, I suppose the desire would still be there, but more in a sadistic sort of way. Burn, America! Burn! Come to think of it, I might feel that way if I were French, too. But I digress.
