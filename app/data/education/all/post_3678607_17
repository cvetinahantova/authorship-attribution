Today was me day of undiluded understanding. I figured a few things out. First: I miss my friends. Second: I don't need them and anyone who truly needs thier friends for everyday life is not comfortable enough with themselves. Third: Nohting makes me fell betten than driving 8o miles per hour listening to the Police and Pink Floyd. I went to Borders, Books, and Music today and after an hour of bumming around and finally gotten to reading a Sex and the City book, 4 girls walked in. And I knew all of them. These are the girls created by Abercrombie and Fitch and the inevitable "Roxy". Never really friends, although I used to hang with their crowd. Anyway, I kinda halk-freaked out and crawled into my shell. I don;t know why and it took about 10 minutes of my convincing myself that these girls, who, yes, all know me by name, don't give a rats soft behind about that girl named Allyson Hoolder hiding behind her short hair and Vanity Fair. Excepting the fact that my naturally red hair is unusually bright, I think they saw me. Is it possible that they were intimidated? No. Scared? No. Didn't want to talk to me? YES!! Ding-ding-ding.  Oh God, what have I done. I am practically a walking contradiction. I really don't know why. Also, I think I might be either the oldest or youngest 16-year-old on the planet. I am destined to be forever alone? I seem to have gotton this far. God, I am so confused...
