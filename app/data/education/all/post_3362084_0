As some of you already know I have a very good friend (Chris) who is teaching English in Japan.  Finally, with the help of my friend I am scheduled to go from the 17th of June until the next Sat (26th) to be there.  Soo excited to not only see Chris but the go to the mother land and see what life is like in a place where there is actually some culture.  The only other place that had an ounce of culture was Mexico but that was like 4 years ago.  Ahhhh I am strangely nervous to go on the plane, its seriously been 4-5 years since I've stepped into one.  All that waiting and searching people for bombs or some nail clippers.  Luckily my friends who I am going with have been on a plane within the last 6 months so I am in pretty good hands.
