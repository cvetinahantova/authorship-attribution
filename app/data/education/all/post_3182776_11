Spent last night at Hav's place lounging on exciting new double (possibly soon to be marital) bed, watching High Fidelity and wishing I was John Cusack. Also ate some white chocolate easter egg with my name on it. Mmm.  Woke up to obscenely sunny day which we perversely but productively spent in an internet cafe scoping for wedding venues. Established Alexandra Palace marginally too small for our seating requirements. We may be looking into Wembley Stadium.  Return to college beckons like a big beckony thing that's a bit loomy and rather larger than I'd like. I don't wanna do any more work. Maybe I'll become a monk and walk the earth doing kung fu.   Tons of jobs in the TES today. Bugger.
