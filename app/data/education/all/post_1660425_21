Technology is constantly trying to become smaller, more user friendly, and faster. If a student has a choice between a large textbook and a CD-ROM, GREAT!! It is important to make students feel involved in learning. By providing them with an option in their learning, they are taking ownership in their learning. The problem that I have seen arise in integrating technology is providing adequate resources for those students that do not have access to technology outside of the school walls. Those students have to be provided the same opportunities as those students that have access to technology at home. I would like to see integration of technology INCREASE within our educational system.
