urlLink Men   Metrosexual?  Gosh, I thought I had heard it all until I read this little story about men who are learning how to pamper themselves.  LOL.  OK then, I was certainly enlightened by this story.  Just when I thought that I was limited to using DIAL soap or DOVE I now learn it is ok to pamper myself with skin moisturizers and no one will think that I am weird or overtly feminine.  Honey, you are off the hook for Christmas.  I did want a Jaguar for Christmas but now I realize that I have been missing the boat.  I want to pamper myself now.  OK, yes, we need an extra bathroom now because once you buy me all those cool pampering items you will never get me out of the powder room. LOL.... hahahahahahaha
