My co-workers and I were talking today about what games we used to play when we were younger (talking about the 70’s here).  One thing that we all had in common is that we had apple fights.   Fall would be approaching – the apples getting ripe.  You’d start early to gather apples for your stash.  That was part of the fun – finding a place to hide your apples!  It had to be a good hiding spot where no one else could find them, but you also had to be able to remember yourself where they were AND get to them easily as soon as a fight broke out!  At first we’d just throw the apples at each other – the more rotten they were, the better splat could be achieved.  But then someone got the braining idea to stab the apple onto the end of a stick and fling it at your enemy.  This worked great… but we got even more inventive!  Remember those long, orange, safety flags for bikes?  The poles were made out of a fiberglass sort of material.  If you rubbed the end just right on the sidewalk, you could make quite the spear.  And being fiberglass, they were more flexible than a stick, and boy could you get some fling action going!   I miss the days of the apple fights… sure there were tears, and yelling, and the occasional “I’m telling mom”, but by evening we usually all made up and were out with our flashlights for a rousing game of Flashlight Tag.   My daughter doesn’t play outside as much as I did when I was a kid…  of course, things don’t seem as safe now as they did back then.  We ran freely around the neighborhood, playing in the creek, sledding down the hills, jumping rope in the park,  biking around the town…  Wish somehow we could find that sort of freedom again.
