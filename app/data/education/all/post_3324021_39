It's sad to say that our only administrator capable of doing anything decent to help us (the student body) has now left us. Gary Buslepp our former Asst. Principal applied for the position of principal at Pierce Middle School. After going through the process of picking an applicant DR. C. Suzanne Klien (Superintendent of Schools) made the decision to bring in Buslepp. We wish Mr.Buslepp good luck at Pierce, and hope that the superintendent makes a wise choice when picking our new Asst. Principal so we don't have all incompetent fools running our school.
