Last night was better, woke up around 05:45. I've got to try and motivate myself today to sort out a car, otherwise I'm going to be without transport. Trouble is I dont know whether to use all the money for a half decent car for 1500 or just go for a "runner" at 500 quid.  I need to look at pricing up a couple of projects that I have to do at home. A local organisation want a projector set-up and mounted and a friend of a friend has a PC on XP home that he wants to network! With trying to fit it in everything else I have to think about, its getting a bit awkward, especially with transport doubts.  The worst thing about it is that I wont be paid for either job!
