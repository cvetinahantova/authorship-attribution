ugh, i just saw a preview for a show called "the swan."  apparently it's a beauty pageant for all these women who get plastic surgery.  it really makes me wonder how the world got so screwed up.  everything about this show is so incredibly wrong.  it makes me sick.  why can't everybody just be happy with what God gave them?  and why can't people understand that everyone isn't supposed to look the same?  anyway, enough about that...  so i'm sitting over here in drew's parents house, their sunroom to be exact.  it's really nice to be living in a house again.  i mean i like living in my apartment and all, but i really like having stairs, 2 different doors, a yard, pets, lots of windows, and different rooms.  they come back next saturday.  i figured that while i was here i was going to start reading some books so i went to the bookstore today.  with my educator discount and the $20 gift certificate kurt gave me, i bought 4 books and spent less than $4.  actually 2 of them were in this really cool used book section of the store, so each of those were only like $4 a piece to start with.  i'll have to check in there more often...although i really can't afford to buy any more "leisure" items like books or music for a while.  my purchases included: atlas shrugged, stranger in a strange land (both of those suggested readings), maggie cassidy, and naked lunch.  i'm going to start reading tonight!  my birthday is monday.  it might be lonely.  amber and drew are in spain.  i think i might go out with 2 other friends on tuesday night.  unfortunately the twins are playing their first game monday night so a lot of people won't be around the night of my actual birthday.  i'll be going out with my coworkers for drinks on thursday night...which will be interesting considering i don't really drink anymore.  oh well...what's another birthday?  :)  okay, i'm going to start doing some school stuff...later...
