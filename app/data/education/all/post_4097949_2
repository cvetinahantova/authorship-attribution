Questions and answers.  David Lynch films and Daniel Quinn books.  Call me Ishmael and what we have been wondering all along comes outloud in words and thoughts, not dreams. I dream to forget 1993-1998. That era should be stricken from the record. My family life was brutal and dishonest. I was so painfully uncool and listened to tasteless music. Unforgettable. Nat King Cole i was not.  Enough about regret.  There is still time to make new memories however unpleasant the present climate. I dream of music and indie record labels and writing. It never seemed so far away. I even wanted to be a cinematographer at one point. Yet, i seem to have a phobia about photography. The same goes for painting. I secretly despise those who waste their talent on self-absorption.  If i could have my own creation myth it would be that i could do something of substance. Does that constitute being a teacher? With a slightly used history degree? i remain faithfull i will find out just exactly what am i good at even though I am almost 25. Although, the worst is when other people pull you down. Whether former supposed comrades question your character and you decide the best answer is no answer....then perhaps you have entered a new realm of maturity. John Cusack would be proud.  Fuck their altering opinions.  i am an altered beast beyond their perceptions of a brown-skinned 18-34 male. They do not represent me nor did i vote for them to be my peers. Where do these naysayers come from? They tend to have the annoying success and irony of meaningful jobs or being in love before you.  Love your enemies.  Why is it when loved ones get married you are actually happy for them.....but what happens when other individuals that come and go in your life exchange their vows?  Your indifference threatens to gets the better of you. You resort to petty grievances and bitterness creeps in questioning why should they have a succesful relationship? Cynicism reminds me of the divorce rate, much more is the soothing prospect of not having to attending a boring wedding.  The latter statement makes me break out in smile.  Now Jamie's wedding was a lot of fun. That's what i call a wedding. I would have him DJ it anytime.  Still.  Love seems ever elusive to me. Catch me if you can little brown-skinned gingerbread man. I sing my songs at the volume of High Fidelity because i am the last of the hopeless romantics.  Speaking of which, i was quite unhappy to miss Kristen's wedding. I thought it would be honorable to support a good friend on an important day. Alas, I could not make it and regret not being there. The way Rachel described it in an email provoked sincere emotion from even me. Being stuck in South Korea starts to suck when you miss crucial weddings not to mention a brand-new shiny Pearl Jam tour for a good cause.  Bush must not win. Repeat, recycle, rinse out the truth. Question this man's authority not the one on a bumper sticker.  Time is running out on the 25th hour. If i want to start a record label or become a writer of merit, i'd better hurry up and pull a Rob Gordon. Can't say the same the for love. It has a time of its own. Still looking for a girl who knows how to lace her Doc Martens and has a decent vinyl collection.     Better put it on a wishlist as a man of supposed faith.          "....i wish i was the verb   to trust   and never let you down...." - EV
