urlLink   I read an interesting  urlLink blog  that discusses the relationship between freedom and passion.  Isn't it nice to know that there are  urlLink people out there thinking  about topics like this?? :-)  I found his statement that we are "only prisoners of of our past choices" to ring true.  You may have noticed that I was also delving into the idea of choice (problem solving) in my last  urlLink post .  For some reason, it's been on my mind lately.  It just seems to me that we all get caught up in a fatalistic view of our lives.  We tell ourselves that we can't do this or that, or we "have to" do something, when what we really need is to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps and get in gear.  Our own mental wishing and negativity seem to prevent this from happening.  Take me, for example.  I  urlLink whine and moan  to myself inside my head. "I should give up  urlLink smoking  for good." "I should  urlLink exercise  more." "I should  urlLink eat to fuel  my body." "I should  urlLink date  more girls."  You get the idea.  It boils down to this:  You must choose to do it.   urlLink Then you do it .  Period.  So, I mean to pick myself up by the bootstraps and start living my own life.  Inspiring, isn't it??  I'll keep you updated on how it's going.  Until then, enjoy  urlLink this little morsel...
