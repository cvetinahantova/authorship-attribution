Yesterday was spent being completely paranoid that Monkeypants was going to leave me.  I had somehow convinvced myself that since we wanted to spend his time in the afternoon with Craig and Amy (which I had known about since Monday) that he ws chosing them over me and therefore, leaving me.  I understand that this puts me in the absolutely insane category, but I can't help it.  HoJo hurt my feelings, too.  She's treating me as Josh and Ward treated her, and I don't think she even sees it.  i'm glad that she enjoyed her 21st birthday, but I still feel as though The H*Factor and I were her "backup" plan and we only got called because she got ditched by her work friends.   I feel that I'm a very loyal and honest friend, but I guess that's not what she wants as she never calls, invites me out, comes over.  Monkeypants has told *no one* that we're getting married.  I'm crushed and devestated.  I feel as though he proposed in a desperate act to prevent me from leaving and it was just a ploy to keep me around.  Is he ashamed of me?  Does he not want anyone to know that he's chosen me?  Why wouldn't he tell people?  I'm telling everyone.  I'm so excited and proud of him.  He hasn't even told his roommates.  He's breaking my heart...  When did I become a responsible adult?  Why am I suddenly a passive person?  I will apparently, for no extra charge, let everyone in my life walk all over me.  My Dad, my boyfriend, my friends.  No, please, treat me as you will, and I'll sit here silently denying that you've hurt me.  Make all of my decisions while you're at it, will you?   I have to stop, before I cry at work again.
