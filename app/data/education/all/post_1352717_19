I know I should be posting my thoughts here and not the stuff I get from other people. I find it hard to be serious all the time. Even in the face of a crisis, I would always find a way to make fun of my situation or link my situation to something amusing. I read this blog from a friend and I saw colors. I couldn't help but cry. Although I haven't seen her and the child, I somehow feel some form of attachment to them. I have been critical of her actions and indifferent toward his lifestyle but the kid is just a kid and he is innocent of his parents' sins.  I find it strange that I feel deeply and strongly for the loss. I can only imagine the pain a mother feels when she loses her child. It's more than losing a lover, it's losing an extension of your life. I can imagine the deep, dark void inside her, nothing can ever fill the emptiness she now feels.  I'm sorry. I wish I could comfort you but you never came to me for comfort. I'm sorry for being critical. I just wanted you to do the right thing, be the best you can be. And for you, the father, I hope you find it in your heart to change, be a better man. You can never find happines in temporal things. Both of you, have peace in your hearts. Go with God. To the one in heaven playing with the angels, pray for your parents.
