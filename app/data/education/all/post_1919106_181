I was initially against getting my parent's suggestions to get a bike. After all, I'm just a relatively short (~30 minutes) walk away from school, and it's good exercise. But I recently found some really nice areas in the vincinity, and taking a bike trip through the countryside looks more and more promising each time. I could do that in the car, but   I want the exercise and.  The car deserves a rest.  I've been looking at prices, and what's surprising me the most is that there's few places left that will sell you just a fucking plain bike. They constantly have to add 18+ gears, weird-ass frame designs, and whatnot. Mind you, I'm not 100% against gears - going uphill can be tough - but 3 is more than enough. If you're going up a hill that would justify the 18 gears then you're probably better off by getting off the bike and pushing it anyway.  Having said that, I had hoped for a nice sunny day to go off picnicking in the hills, but it seems that wish wasn't granted to me. So I'll do homework instead (or at least pretend I do it by thinking about the assignments every hour or two).
