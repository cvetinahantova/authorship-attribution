My Lora is beautiful. She got her haircut today and it is absolutely perfect. Then she died it back dark and then it was perfecter.  I was remembering the way that she used to look at me, as if she was excited to see that I was there, everytime she saw me. I was remembering the way she used to press herself to me; make herself so little and me so big I was remembering the way her long long hair moved.  And I thought "I will walk through hell and back to get there again. I will give up everything and burn myself away, just to see that girl again."
