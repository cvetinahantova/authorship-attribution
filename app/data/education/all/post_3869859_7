And this is H2. I feel better now that I've realized this.   Catch the Wind, by Donovan (performed by Joan Baez)   In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty  I'll want to be in the warm hold of your loving mind  To feel you all around me and to take my hand along the sand  Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind   When sundown pales the sky I want to hide awhile, behind your smile  And everywhere I look your eyes I'd find  For me to love you now would be the sweetest thing, would make me sing  Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind   When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears  To help me to leave all my blues behind  For standing in your heart is where I want to be and long to be  Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
