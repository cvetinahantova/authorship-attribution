...that already, in the inarguably nascent stages of this endeavor, I am lax.  Oh well.  But now that I have witnessed the end of the Democratic National Convention and the birth of the new terror alert, I feel like I have enough to prattle on about for at least another spate of paragraphs.            Eleanor Holmes-Norton, the congresional delegate from Washington DC (sucks for her) is on the TV and has just seemed to endorse the torture of suspected terrorists.  Or maybe she didn't.  But Wolf Blitzer blows.  He harangued Howard Dean for saying that the Republicans use the terror alert system to instil fear in the American public for political reasons.  Blitzer seems to think that sort of thought is wacky, other dimensional bullshit.  Which leads me to conclude that my view (full agreement with the Dean perspective) is outlandish and in the vast minority.          Now CNN has some "expert" on the phone who is lauding the new alert because it is more comprehensive and specific than the ones that have preceeded it.        For some reason that I can't understand, CNN has a map graphic of this "expert" in Cambridge Massachusetts.  It's akin to the graphics that we get to watch when reporters are doing thier job from places without it either hard to take pictures or raining thousands of American ordinance from the sky.  Why the fuck is that in there?  It has nothing to do with anything.       The only problem that I have with Howard Dean is the fact that he is so extremely inelegant in his speech.  He has no nuance whatsoever and, though inarguably much more educated and qualified to be president, is only slightly more rhetorically gifted than the current president.  Case in point was his inability to make a really cogent case for his statements this morning.  In fact, his was such a blunt defense of his position that I wonder if he isn't doing the bidding of the Kerry campaign by sounding for the left, even if that sounding is blind anger.        As I said above, my problem with the administrations motives is Howard Dean's.  But I think I can do a better job of explaining it.  It is not because of the alert itself.  Certainly I don't disagree with the idea that if something is wrong, you tell us about it.  But my issue is with the manner in which this alarming is done.  The first commander of the Department of Homeland Security gets on the box and says that he has info.  In this case, he even says that he has multiple sources of info about multiple specific nations.  But that's it.       And this administration wants us to take it in faith that they are telling us the truth.  All that they have done for the past three and a half years is lie to us.  And fuck you if you don't agree with that last statement.  You're kidding yourself, blind and I refuse to listen to anything more that you have to say in defense of that position.        If they really wanted us to believe it, they could maybe get the people who are in charge of the agencies that procured those multiple sources and have them talk to us about what sort of sources those really are.  They have no credibility when they want us to take things on a faith that we do not have in them.
