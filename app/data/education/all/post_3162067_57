The shower has taken on a life of it's own again, veering wildly between fantastically hot and fucking freezing. Every now and then I hear a scream and have to run into the bathroom to see Si cowering away from the watersaying "can you just adjust the taps for me honey?" Oops, there he goes! Trip to the dentist was uneventful: my fillings are still under guarantee so when they get done in a few weeks I won't have to pay! Hurrah!
