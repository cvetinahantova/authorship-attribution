Dear Journal, Coming this weekend, Kim and Jessie are to be moving out. Things are stressful here lately. I keep doing something or another to irritate Mama. I start a new weight loss pill tomorrow. Also, Dr. Shaikh says I have to have my tonsils and adenoids removed. I’ve been thinking about it and I’ve decided that, when I get it done, no more cigarettes! This will be my first surgery thing, pregnancies excluded; I’m a bit nervous about it. Mama says I must believe in God, if I believe what the Bible says, referring to “In the last days, one will not be able to tell between the seasons”. Why? Jerusalem got snow! A lot of it! I do believe the world will end soon; I feel it deep inside. I’m scared though. Everyone who believes in God that he is our savior will go to heaven. But I don’t know what I believe; I’ve got no religion. I’m confused about “God”. Will I go to Hell due to my confusion and uncertainty?? Will I become simply a lost soul, doomed to wonder the chaotic world or what’s left of it?? Yes, that scares me.
