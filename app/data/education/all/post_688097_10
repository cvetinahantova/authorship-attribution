My second update for the year 2003, I guess its for the reason that nobody comes to see my blog anyway. Well, I just want to say that there's been a lot of things that happened in my life recently... Well, its been almost four months, of course things will happen.   To start, I want you all to see my new websites;  urlLink insideHogwarts  - a Harry Potter site, and... Oh, I forgot, I only have one new site, and thats's it.   Also, I have read a new book entitled; "A Series of Unfortunate Events - The Bad Beginning". I thing its a seven part book written by Lemony Snicket. Its full of...unfortunate events, like the title doesnt say enough. Its about the experiences of three siblings after their parents's tragic death. Its also pretty funny and hilarious, maybe its one of the author's ways of compensating the tragically depressing events.  I cant seem to remember anything else aside from the movies I watched recently, like X-Men2, The Core, etc. So, I leave you guys now and hope to update sooner than 4 months. =P
