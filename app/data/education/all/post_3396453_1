im feeling strange again. actually  depress  and feeling down. with one question in mind. AM I HARD TO LIKE? tell me honestly, tell me now. is it the way i  talk ? or the way i  look ? is it because of my  hair  or the way i  eat ? tell me the reason and i'll change them all, i just want to be looked at in a different way,  not just a friend  but.. a  girl  who wishes   to love and be loved  . maybe... soon you will realize my worth,   soon dear GOD i hope.   ~ some lines i put together way back. when i was falling for my guy friend... well, that guy is still my guy friend. no more no less.. but im happy.
