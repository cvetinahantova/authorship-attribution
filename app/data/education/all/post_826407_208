urlLink quite a scathing attack on the Emerging Church , but one that raises a lot of issues.  My big concern with the whole "emeraging church" thing (and I speak as someone trying to do it) is that it can simply become a new vocabulary, a few cool images and rituals that we just place onto a a pre-existing Christianity Package to fit us like cultural camoflage.   I'm not sure that level of change is enough.  Where the emerging conversation excites me is in the places that we talk about new ways of relating to God and new ways of serving our world that are approriate to now.  I don't particularly want to make cool services or have great things.  But I feel a needed for humble commitment to rethinking how certain things are done.  I know its just  a label and its just branding.  But the wholesale use of the "emerging church" title makes me feel a little too self important.
