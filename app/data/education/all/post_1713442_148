urlLink Free E-mail for MSU Fans!  I have been using this site for three years for free e-mail.  I don't want to use my primary e-mail address for lists so I use an address at iam4msu.com.  The service is decent and the advertising is tolerable.  Give this a try if you want a throw away e-mail address that stands out from Yahoo or Hotmail.  Of course, if you like MSU (Michigan State University, Memphis State University, Minnesota State University, etc.) the address is even better.
