Those who complain that Michael Moore "can't have it both ways" by mixing entertainment and journalism (as if that didn't occur everyday on the major networks!) should know that William Karel has prepared a documentary that approaches the subject of the Bush "dynasty" with unflinching gravity. The "World according to Bush" airs today on France 2, and its trailer, as well as an extract from the film, can be viewed  urlLink here , in English. I would recommend their viewing as well to those who are not so prudish about distinctions of 'genre' and 'medium.'
