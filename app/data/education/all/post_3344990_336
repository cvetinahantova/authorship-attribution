urlLink    How about a trip down memory lane. This picture is of me , James standing on the left next to my sister Tanya in her blue dress on right. I believe I was around 9 years old in this picture.  This is the suit that I wore when I got my naturalization papers to become an American Citizen.  Â  urlLink
