I got FFXI! Yay!!! It has taken me all weekend to get it installed. I've had to reinstall it two times and I'm updating it now. Hopefully it will work now. I have yet to play it. :(  I think the game looks pretty good. I'll post my opinion of it once I get to play it. LOL.  It costs $13.99 a month, $1 a month for the card game, Tetra Master if you want to play it, and $1 extra per month for each extra character you make.  Hopefully the prices are worth it.
