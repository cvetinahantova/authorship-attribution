about reliable internet access?  I lied.  The most frustrating part is that I know no one is reading this.  I haven't posted regularly for almost a month now and I don't blame you people for abandoning me.  But, just in case anyone is still reading, please participate in my letter campaign against SBC.  (Some of you may remember them as Ameritech.  And guess what?  They're still assholes.)  Cut and paste the following text into an email to those pig fuckers and insert your name at the end.  Make sure you use  your  name.  And please include your ss# so that they know I'm not just spamming them.    Dear Pig Fuckers,  Because you refuse to repair the outage of your registration server for Chicago, IL., I am unable to read my favorite blog, Impeccable Jones.   This laziness on your pig-fucking part is most troubling.  Because when you fuck with Impeccable Jones, you fuck with the Impeccable Army.  Unless you fix the problem within twenty-four hours, I will personally come to the home of each and every one of your IT geeks with a fifty pound magnet and a sledge hammer.  How I will accomplish this is not for you to know.  I am the Santa Claus of vengeance, bitch. I will wiggle down your chimneys and I will fuck you up.  Best,  [Your Name Here] [Your Social Security # Here]
