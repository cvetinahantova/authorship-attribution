I just showed HER my blog and she doesn't understand it at all...made a funny face, said  "I'm waiting for my girfriend to bring me sandwiches"  in one of those singsongy voices.  Then she asked me how many people I thought would look at my site.  I didn't want to let her win, so I responded with "lots".  I lied.     On an unrelated note, I believe that beer is one of God's miracles (especially when it comes in 40-ounce quantities with a budweiser label on it).
