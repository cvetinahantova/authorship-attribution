I am really agonising over whether to let Angela know about my Blog. I've been thinking it for a while, but I am scared she won't like what she reads and it might just be a case of it being too much for her to cope with.   Its tearing me up inside that I have a secret from her - probably my only one - but it contains lots of other little secrets. What to do? - I have come so close to telling her on more than one occasion, but I don't want to lose her.    We had our 1 week anniversary today. Only a week, but it feels like she knows more about me than 13 years with Sandra. Angela - Angel....mine anyway. God sent? Who knows? .....probably!
