it's that time again! homecoming. yay. i'm in kansas for the carnival that is held in this tiny little town every year. i'm really sad that we aren't staying for the street party sunday night! but that's ok, you only win at the raffle if you are rich or italian. besides Andrew and Phil have a date that night...  i kinda wonder if i'll run into Nasty Nate while i'm here.. you guys remember him right? the 30 yr old man who claimed to be 23 at Gigi's apartment... in my defense he didn't look that old lol... he grew up in Frontnac (a little town right outside the little town where i am) and his parents still live there and he comes up here every now and then. how funny would that be? oh and y'all know i can't wait to see Timmy, wonder how many teeth he has left? it's a good thing i left Sadie at home... he would be more interested in her.  i grossed myself out with that one.. haha..
