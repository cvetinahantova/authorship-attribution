Sandra keeps getting text messaages from Paul, the husband of a former friend - (Jill and Sandra had an argument after she used Sandra as an excuse for her and Paul splitting up). They are both back together and have just returned from 2 weeks holiday, but now Sandra has had a series of texts from Paul saying he has missed her and can't get her out of his head!!!!  There is absolutely nothing in it from Sandra's point of view, although she is gullable, she was just a shoulder to cry on while he was going through a rough time. There is no doubt in my mind though that Paul fancies Sandra and would like to sleep with her.
