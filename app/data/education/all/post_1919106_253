...And it doesn't involve high explosives!    The past week has been quite eventful. I won't deny that it hasn't been good for  everyone , but what happened was inevitable. It is not something that I did lightheartedly, but I don't regret it. Amy was right in saying that I can't always act selflessly, and that I have to think about myself from time to time.   There are only 3 weeks left to the semester... It sure doesn't feel like it. It's been a busy time, and will be busier as the finals start creeping up. But despite that I am satisfied. I learned much in that time, both about school and about my life. Work is challenging, but not repetitive. And as much as I dislike Algorithms, I do have to admit that I enjoy many of the topics covered. Even the assignments are enjoyable -  because  they are tough it is much more satisfying when I find the solution. Perhaps some more programming and a few practical problems instead of pure theory would be nice, but I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.   Life is good, and I am happy. And just for this moment, that is enough. Cheers!
