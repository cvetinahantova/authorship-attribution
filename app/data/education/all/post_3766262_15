A week off before we begin school. The city is on vacation this week. Ain´t that great?! I wish cities in the states would choose one week a year to close everything and enjoy their surroundings!  Me and the girls decide to take a little trip with all of our free time. So, at 5AM today, we were on a fabulous, air conditioned bus to Copan: a location of massive Mayan ruins in Honduras, on the border of Guatemala.  Here, now in this air-conditioned internet cafe, I stink. My arms were sweating today. My calves were dripping. I can´t drink enough water to satiate my desperately dry throat, and cool my melting body. Clothes are sticking everywhere, to every part of my body, leaving my underwear in a sticky, twisted knot near my waist, stuck to a leg, too low on my stomach. I have never wanted to strip in public more than I did today!  The ruins, however, are nothing short of amazing. How those little Mayans, thousands of years ago, created such architecturally interesting, intricate, and ornate work baffles my mind. It makes me want to get involved in some pottery classes. I´ll download pictures when I get back home in San Salvador.  Small, one-woman tienda´s , crooked stone streets, men on horseback, local commodores with homemade tortillas, fresh frijoles, and satisfyingly milky horchata. The town of Copan is traditionally Central Cmerican, more so than the big cities which are mostly striving to be the US, which is both bad and good. They have a long way to go, but all those damn chains have made it here- arrgh!  Tomorrow, we take a bus to Tela, on the Caribbean side of Honduras, for a few days on a beautiful beach. When I begin to melt, I´ll seek solace in the cool, blue waters of the coast. Right now, we´re off to shower, and find us a couple of cervezas.  Hasta Luego
