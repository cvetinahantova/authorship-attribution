In the file of I can't believe  JCR  published this: Dickerson and Gentry learned that low origance (translation: un-artsy), high intellectance (intelligence) folks were more likely to be early adopters of computers. They needed to do research to figure this out!?!! They were also more likely to be "self-designated opinion leaders," and less likely to be a "culinary enthusiast."  Shockingly, individuals with experience with similar products (e.g. programmable pocket calculators, video TV games, pocket calculators, microwave ovens) were also more likely to adopt computers!!!?!! They were less likely to have speed dialing (low origance, high intellectance folks we are told are not big communicators)!  Homeowning folks with more education and higher income were more likely to adopt, as were people in the 30-45 age range (yawn).  Conclusion: "Our results provide general support that adopters of home computers have a profile similar to that individual: they are homebodies who are interested neither in the arts nor in innovations that would enhance their ability to communicate" ( p. 233).  An absolutely seminal work in computer adoption, indeed.
