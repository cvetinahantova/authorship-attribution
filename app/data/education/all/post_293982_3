Hello!  Entertaining weekend...   First, gabe's play,  urlLink fauxgers  was entertaining, and a lovely salute to coffee.  its too bad he's leaving work, but its at least a possibility that ill still talk to him.  besides, in a strange twist, i know his sister ariel through jenny, and not through gabe.    Next, dating a Red sox fan is hard work.  VERY stressful.  Eric does point out that the Red Sox in their ugly red uniforms are also buying into Teresa Heinz's ketchup-scented clothing line.  Then, in that same vein, every guy I ever brought home broke the ice with my father by talking about the Red Sox.  WHY ON EARTH couldnt John Kerry on ESPN tonight break the ice with America, talking about the Red Sox?  Finally, required watching for people in my line of work:  urlLink The Perfect Score .  I thought it was going to be painfully idiotic, but in many places it was hysterical.  The sxtoned, buy yet shakespearean-fool-like Roy was my favorite.    Back to dishes :)
