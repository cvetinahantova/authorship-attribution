I must say the dog is perfectly fine.  This morning I was squatted down looking thru a box of books, and all of the sudden I felt a cold nose go up my shorts.  I haven't jumped or screamed like that in ages!!!!  The boys have decided I can never let dad run out of happy pills.  He is like a totally different man now.  I am so glad.    Random thoughts   No matter how hard they try, or how good their aim is, boys always miss the toilet.  Never sit on my toilet before wiping it down with a wipe.  I am a lucky woman.  A Jamocha shake from Arby's would be wonderful right now.  Bicycles, pavement and barefeet don't mix.  Niether does skateboards, pavement and barefeet.  to a 5 yr old, mayo, ketchup and mustard is a good sandwich.  to a 35 yr old it is a recipe for disaster.
