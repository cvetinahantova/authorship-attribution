Ok, this is the post that wouldnâ€™t go through, last time I tried (July 14th). Enjoy.  Dammit! There was an error in publishing my last post! Dammit! It didn't show up, and it was all erased! Here's a summary: I like piercings. I want at least 15 more. I want a Scottish tattoo in honor of my clan. It will be on my hip and I'm getting it next spring. I also want some surgery to make my ears pointier, my tongue longer and my knuckles permanently brassier (on the inside). I also want purple or black hair. And mumsy approves of none of this. And so, basically, I have to wait till I move out for most of it. Oh well. And, also, before I publish this post, I'm going to copy it, so if there is an error, all I have to do is hit paste. Stupid computer.
