When his star fell, it was sad. Mr. Dean is very cool! GO DEAN GO!!!! Thank you for being a politician that actually says something with a grain of truth! Anyway, I forgot to tell you all that while I was waiting for my father to see a doctor at the ER, I saw a peacock. This was in the middle of a rant because my father had gone inside and no one would let me go inside with him. Even though my father asked for me. Some hospital...I was talking about how gay and lesbians fight to go into the ER and make decisions. I felt like Ellen in that episode of her old show. She tried to get into the ER when her girlfriend was in a car accident. You know that one with Anne Heche..that's the one. I kept trying to go through the doors. I had to then drive back to my house and bring in the BIG guns: MY MOM. They wouldn't let her in either until she was confirmed by my father. Some hospital, this while friends of a kid who had his privates sliced in an extreme game stunt were going in and out to see him. After that speech, yes, I saw a peacock. It was a very colorful male one that was walking around outside. I wondered why no one else was impressed. Then I began to think maybe I was the loon and should check myself into the inpatient ward for mental health. But, alas, my mom saw it also as I drove up, (my second trip to the ER). That was some moment. I saw peacocks in the zoo, but never in front of me walking down the street. As far as today. I watched Guiding Light and missed 15 minutes of it which made me come to an important decision. Any politican who interupts my very favorite soap, I will not vote for. Nope, not a chance. I especially hate the reporters who have to analyze after. Everyone should shut up. I think America news programs are way too alarming. I was watched the BBC and almost fell asleep because it was so boring, that's how conditioned I am to American news and the 24/7 channels. For once I think Bill O'Reilly should take the blame.
