Today was a good day. Snow was faliing everywhere this morning and I was sure that we wouldn't have school or stay there for the whole day but we did. I'm beginning to finally after almost a year, be content again in my life and am becoming more happy and alive since depression entered my life. Kinda sad way to waste two years of your life, but everything happens for a reason and I must go on with the show. It's Valentines Day soon and to all you lonely people: You aren't alone. There are other lonely people to be with so you won't be lonely. Love all of you tons!   Everything's coming back together and I don't expect it to happen, but I still drown in the possibilities of one thing that would make my life fuller.   And I am a dreamer so you sent me away........sometimes we dreamers, just get in the way.
