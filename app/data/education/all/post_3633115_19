I don't know how many people have the opportunity to have close relationships with their fathers, but I have one with my dad.  I can call my dad with nothing to stay, but can spend an hour on the phone with him not really talk about anything.    S usually spends no more than 10 minutes on the phone with his dad, and others might spend even less than that.  I may not talk to my dad on a daily basis, but even when we do visit, I have been known to stay up until 1 or 2 in the morning just talking about anything and everything, save some topics (i.e. sex  *shiver, cringe*).  I think that the relationship I have with my dad is pretty special. I know it is better than the one I have with my mom.  Then again, that is probably why my dad and I have such a good relationship.  Of course, my mom is a whole other post.
