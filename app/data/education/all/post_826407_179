So, Monday has been and gone and the glass in my room is intact.  We had an awesome weekend at Stu and Emma's wedding.  One of the great things about my inlaws is that they really know how to throw a party.  The service was in the same H and I were married it.  It had nice mix of tradition and the tastes of Em and Stu showing through. Helen was bridesmaid and looked beautiful.     The reception was at a Tudor Barn.  Good food and drink, great company, fine speeches and a mid nineties nostalgia disco.  Superb!  It was so cool to celebrate with them.  Man, Stu's in my family!    Congratulations guys.  Individually you rock, together you'll be unstoppable!  (Photos coming, I promise).
