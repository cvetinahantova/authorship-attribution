hey all,  well it is official the woman running my school is crazy.  apparently she  has a problem with the farangs.  the women she has hired have breasts.  in  her words, "too bulky up top, wear loose clothes, when you look in the  mirror in the morning say am i going karaoke or to school." as you can  imagine i busted out laughing.  also, she has a problem with how we cross  out legs.  we can only cross our ankles.  WHATEVER!  with all the problems  at that school i can't believe she is focusing on how we are sitting.   nutcase.  i'm just amazed someone like her is allowed to run a school.  actually, i take that back mr. cole, my principal, was just as crazy and  unqualified.  maybe this profession just breeds lunatics.  oh well, i plan  on sitting how i please.  she can't afford to fire me right now because she  just had three people quit. HA!  i don't blame them.  one of them was a  really nice Filipino woman named grace.  they pay filipinos slave wages for  doing more work than anyone else.  it really sucks for them here.  well i've gotta run.  i'm meeting a friend for brunch. love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.
