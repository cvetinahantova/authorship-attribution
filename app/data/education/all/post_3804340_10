Holiday started. I lived my life just like a pig. Here is my rountine:  Wake up--->breakfast--->sleep again--->some TV--->sleep--->tuition--->home--->sleep  It was the ideal life when I was longing for my holiday 10 days ago. Now I get what I wanted and so? I am thinking whether I am suffering from 'Chinese disease'. Chinese are often praised(?) as hard working. I am very hard working. So hard working that I don't know who I am besides my work. A philosopher said 'I think therefore I am'. In my case, it will be 'I work therefore I am'.My holiday means a pause of my working cycle and I don't know who I am. Get a balance between work and play is something I have to learn.
