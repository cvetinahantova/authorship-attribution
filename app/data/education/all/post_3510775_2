What to do, people?  What to do?  Little bro's b-day on Sunday... Little sis's college graduation a week from Sunday... but I gotta take care of my dog, and I hate running around on my vacation.  Should I just go up for the graduation?  Should I go up for the birthday too, and spend a possibly excruciating 10 days in Michigan?  Let me know what allsyalls think.  And step on it!  :-)
