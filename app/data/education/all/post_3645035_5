I have come to you today to adress what is both a common threat and a common cause: the stupid kid we all love to hate, Vincent Chung.    Flashback to computer engineering class, late january. We were sitting there working on games. I had been working on one such game for about an hour, and I was proud of my Pui Yan date sim. Suddenly Vincent came up and started making manly advances on John Molloy. I did not think too much of this because it is something that happens all too often in computer engineering class. WHABAM! Vincent suddenly deletes my game. I realized that because I was a dolt I had forgotten to save it beforehand. It was at this point I swore I would kill Vincent Chung.    While we all hate him, Vincent Chung has become a legend of sorts not for his low IQ but for his carefree butchering of the English language. Allow me to touch on several recent butcheries of such a form.  " Yo guy, you are invalid!" - Vincent's point of view on the nuclear arms race.  " These terms are satisfactory." - Vincent's dramatic closure of a mythology play.  " Do you know where is Molloy?" - Vincent's desperate call for male bonding.  " Coopah is gay wif Maaaaahtinn" - Vincent's desperate comeback every time he gets zinged while I or Martin is anywhere withni earshot.     Such incidents are a disturbing dent on society as we know it being the gifties that we are. I would like to thank you, Vincent, for providing us with a model. A model of something we hope to never see again. An incarnation of what we hate about society. I would also like to say that those who are your friends do so because they do not know any better. Only a really socially insecure person would befriend a twat such as yourself. That is all.
