urlLink Mass Communication: Technology Use and Instruction. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Shawna Brynildssen.  It looks at different ways to teach about mass communication.  From the ERIC Digest:  There are a number of compelling reasons for incorporating technology into the instruction of journalism and mass communication. As technology plays an increasingly important role in our lives, it becomes vital to expose journalism students to that technology. Some scholars have gone so far as to state that any journalism school that does not assimilate new technology is ignoring the facts of the rapidly changing environment (Singer, Craig, Allen, Whitehouse, Dimitrova, & Sanders, 1996).   And indeed, new technology is heavily used throughout the journalism and mass communication industry (Bowen & Durbin, 2001). With newspapers across the country producing online versions, and television stations broadcasting programs using high-definition images, it seems irrational for journalism schools not to follow what practitioners are employing. In fact, according to some researchers, the very nature of journalism requires its educators to take a proactive approach to using technology in instruction. Sutherland (2001) posits that because it is the job of journalists to stay on the cutting edge, journalism schools should be "pioneers" in using the new technology.   There is another practical reason why journalism and mass communication educators want to use new technology: because it is cost effective (Huesca, 2000). However, it may cost more at the beginning when all the channels and equipments are not fully established.
