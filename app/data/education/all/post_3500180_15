Wooo, never updated this late before.. (I do get amused easily, don’t I?)  Today we had a parade in Brown City, which is somewhere in Michigan, United States. We all arrived at the Band Centre at 10:00 a.m., because we were supposed to, and left half an hour later when everybody was there and was in the Spirit of Windsor t-shirt. We had to bring our uniforms and instruments with us on the bus, and will change there. Supposedly, the bus ride should be 1 hour, but from leaving the Band Centre to arriving at the parade, it took almost 2 and half hours. We had to change on the bus because we were going to be late. It was quite amusing… Guys just went straight ahead and put on their uniforms, while a lot of girls hesitated, but they still had to change anyways. Me, on the other hand, had shorts under my pants, so I changed without any second thoughts.. Haha. It’s good to be prepared… :P  Anyways, the parade itself was, um, bad… Our backbone marchers wasn’t there today, so we kind of fell apart sometimes. The band was really weak, heh…..>_  Enough of the parade, today is a very nice day. Bright and shiny, with occasionally breezes. Woooooooo *imitates the wind blowing* (no, I am not insane, I’m just a little hyper right now). Wow, so hyper… lalalallaallalala~~~ Okay, me stop now....  Almost ten = almost bed time.... I shall blog later!  Edit to say: I just looked at the title of the entry. Why did they name it Brown City, that's so stupid! It's not even brown!
