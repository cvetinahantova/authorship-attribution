urlLink Michael Lorenzen - Wikipedia  While playing with my name on Google, I found this page.  (I know I am not the only person who Googles himself...)  I had no idea that I warranted a Wikipedia article.  It is unsigned (as are most Wikipedia articles) so I am not sure who put it up.  It is kind of eerie.  Someone took the time to do a little research on me.  I am also unsure how it is decided that someone is a leader in a field...
