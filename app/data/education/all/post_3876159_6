It's a toss up, but I think I will take Dallas.  Thanks for your help and allowing me to see straight through my teary eyes.  Dallas is still inconvenient and I will have to take off of work, but I am so thankful that it is not Houston.  I would have driven there, balling the entire time. Throwing myself a pity party the whole way there and back.     Biggest Problem #1: Freaking out and loosing perspective.   Anyway a big thanks ;)
