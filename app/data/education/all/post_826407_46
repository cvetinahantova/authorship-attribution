A very full weekend.  Half night of prayer with Expression on Friday was fun but hard-work (me a wimp). The last post was kinda in response to it but also in response to my tiredness.  The leaders day was fun, Mike and Sally came and talked/answered questions then we formed a factory line to fill up lots of bags.  (Expression = Slave labour apparently).   The highlight though was Sunday night in the service and welcome lounge.  It was the time when all the plans etc.  really seemed to fit together,  the feel of it was great.  Tim's DJing was perfect, The candles, the food, the chilling - it was all great and there were lots of people there (inc. a few freshers).  Seemed to be church in the best possible way and I hope we can take the best bits of it into our regular celebrations and (probably more likely) clusters.  It was one of those weekends that was so full that it seems like it was at least four weekends cramped into 1.      Wet lunch at School today, the Y7's looked so desperate for someone to entertain them that I ended up organizing Hangman and 20 questions which was a lot of fun.
