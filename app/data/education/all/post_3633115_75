Can anyone explain to me, in fairly simple terms, what pinging is and why people use it?  Also, is trackback the same thing?  Is having this on one's site a useful thing?  Please email me at gretchenn@gmail.com and let me know. I really am curious as to what the whole point of it is.  Also, if anyone can tell me how to make my email a click on link, that would be really helpful also. I only ask because I realized that  urlLink this  doesn't work.  Thanks in advance.
