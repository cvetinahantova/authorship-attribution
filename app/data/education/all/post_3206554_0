from: brett mills sent: thursday, january 29, 2004 14:40 pm subject: my adventures part 1     Hello everyone   Thanks for the emails and kind wishes.   I have arrived in Japan.  I caught a bus from the Osaka airport into the heart of Osaka.  Then a train to Nagoya then a train to Shin Gifu (which is the city where I live, then a train from Shin Gifu to Chajo, which is the kind of the suburb where I live.  Chajo is actually the train station name.  I am having trouble typing on this weird keyboard.  There are English letters with Japanese characters and the space bar is a lot smaller than a `normal` one.   Anyway.  I have met some nice people that are showing me around.  My falt mate is moving out on Sunday, so I will probably have some one new soon.  There are two girls that live upstairs from me, so that is good.  There names are Jess and Emma.  urlLink Jess and Emma    I went grocery shopping yesterday.  Very interesting.   I have orientation on Monday in Nagoya, and from there I will be told where I will be working.  Probably in Gifu.   Anyway, I must go now.  I am happy.  It doesn`t seem real yet.  Hopefully it will soon.   Chat later Brett
