well,  summative exams are pointless and boring.  since you can't fail a kid at st.  joe becasue of the whole losing face thing then why bother with tests.   anyway... all i've been doing all day is standing in front of grade 4 making  sure they don't cheat.  o.k. enough bad now some good news.  yesterday i went to the weekend market  with aurora, teacher from st. joe, and had a wonderful time.  she has lots  of thai friends and they speak very little english so it forces me to use  thai to communicate.  but hey immersion is the best way to learn i think.   well i've gotta run.  oral exams are next and i have to figure out what i'm  doing.  love ya, jane  ps dinner tonight with niles withers  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.
