urlLink    Took this picture overlooking Port Jervis just after coming out of PA from K's wedding. This is actually faked... I had a pic of Jess and a pic of me in these poses, and I put them bot together on this shot. Both mother's said we looked like warrior and that we should have theme music playing behind this. If we start "Jess's: Fiancee Warriors" or "Marital Kombat", I'll be sure to let everyone know.
