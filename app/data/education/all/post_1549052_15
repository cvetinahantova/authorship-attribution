As close as we are today, tomorrow when we come back from that battlefield, we will be as close as two men can possibly be, sharing a bond that can only be forged in the face of imminent disfigurement. We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.    -Jeff Melvoin, Northern Exposure, Kaddish for Uncle Manny, 1993   urlLink
