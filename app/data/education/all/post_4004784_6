The pictures from your sister's wedding were sooo pretty!  I loved the cornflower blue color of your dress, you looked really pretty in it.  You're sister was a very lovely bride - I wish I had dark hair like that, it looks so striking against the white veil.  I can't believe how much taller than your sister you are.  In another note, I do believe that homecoming weekend is indeed Columbus day, because this is my birthday weekend also.  So Dee and I were thinking of forcing everyone to go out to a club in Boston that weekend to celebrate, since everyone should be around for homecoming anyway.    Karen and Mike - I will get to see your apartment before 2004 is over, if its the last thing I do.  I don't care how its done, but I am going to be in NYC until the end of January, and even if I have to make a special trip up there, I'm stopping by.  (and in the morning, I'm making waffles!)  LOLOL - too much Shrek for me.
