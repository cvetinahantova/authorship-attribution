No, it isn'the chocolate, or the bread, or the cosmopolitan attitudes.   It's the preponderance of swords, maces, plate mail and other pre-modern instruments of death/death avoidance.  In America, you only see these things on the cover of heavy metal LPs and inside Dungeons and Dragons manuals.    As a lifelong purveyor of both heavy metal LPs and Dungeons and Dragons manuals, I feel like I'm coming home for the first time.  I'm telling you; this shit is everywhere.  I almost bought a turkish sabre in budapest flea market but I thought better of carrying it around for a couple weeks, let alone across a few borders.    Today, in a castle, we saw a set of scale mail with fucking wings on the back.  Truly. It had feathers and everything.  Bad ass.  You could put Jerry Lewis in there and I wouldn't fuck with him.      We'll be back next week.  I hope everyone is well.
