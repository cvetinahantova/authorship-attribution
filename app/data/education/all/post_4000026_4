It was just awesome today, 5 maths period free of being taught. So the rest of us were just trying out this mock paper for A-maths and come to think of it.. it seemed pretty easy.Well I still need more practice though. Then during recess I forgot to wear my tie and got caught by little vixen(Nat) and paid a dollar fine... she had better use that money for herself and not to put in the councillor fund.Lol. Well then there was a couple more boring classes which turns out that we learn nothing at all. But the fun part was in the Physics lab. We had to do this balancing thingy with a ruler but we just couldn't so we ended up playing with plasticine. Lol it was so weird we were like creating our own animal planet. I made a lion, snail and even a dino..which of course had nothing to do with the practical work but when there's fun, who cares! Lol. Well I did know what teh practical was all about so I guess its fine with me, its just the rest of the classmates who joined the safari. Well during physics remedial, did this test and had like a half an hour break, with the lovely cooling weather I couldn't help but nap....nap till I didn't even know my my paper was handed in. Had an awesome dream too..lol. So in chemistry remedial we had like half the class present, and we got back our test papers. I passed!!!!!!
