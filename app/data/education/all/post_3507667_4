Well one more work day and then I'm off for 5 days. I'm travelling to Ottawa for my Grandparents 75th wedding anniversary. During my trip up I have scheduled several interviews with companies that I'm interested in working with. I will be taking up several resumes and storming the HR offices of potential employers.  I'm very excited about this because I've been wanting to move back to Ottawa for some time now and this might be a chance for me to at the very least test the employment waters and get an appraisal of my corporate worth.  As well I will be visiting some of my friends that have moved or currently live in Ottawa and surrounding areas. Should be allot of fun and many of them haven't seen the girls since they were babies.  All in all i'm very excited about the trip, and can certainly use the break.  On a crappier note, I was assigned another exam track that I have to study for on top of the exams I currently have to write. This one is Exchange 2003: 70-285 - Designing and Planning an Exchange 2003 Deployment. No reference material out for this yet, so I will have to wing it. Not looking forward to it, haha.  Have a great day all.  RLB
