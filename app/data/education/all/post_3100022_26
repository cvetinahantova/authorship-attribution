So Anyway, I have two companies chasing after me to do some programming, which is fantastic! I don't know much about the work place or the the work except that I will be working on some top secret projects? And they can't tell me anything until I sign a NDA. One of the companies is a environmental awareness company that hosts huge dance parties in Ibiza and all around Europe, they use the dance parties to get the message out and do advertising type stuff. The Second Company is involved with pharmaceuticals that's about all I know right now. The people that I have spoken to so far all sound fantastic with very positive attitudes towards life and everything else.  Work at the walkabout pub is still pretty fantastic too, even though the pay is terrible (it is still enough to get along and to pay back debts in NZ).
