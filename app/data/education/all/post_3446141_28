Ok so I love Chinese food!!  I went out to lunch to day with me mum and we decided to go to Chi's which I like a lot.  The only thing I don't like is how I'm always hungry like 2 hours later!! What's up with that?  I'm already thinking about dinner and its only 3:45pm!! Oh well.   Today has been really nice, mostly because I had the day off from work!! Yippee!  But last night I went to see Dream Girls at the Rep and it was VERY good!! I liked it a lot, I even got sung to during it......for real.  There is apart in the play where one of the characters is singing in a "club" and he picks a person from the audience to sing to, granted I just happen to be third row outside seat.........so it was an easy pick!! It's not like I was in the balcony and go sung too....LOL.  Still it was fun.  Then I went out that night to Cajun's which was also fun.....came home, and then around 3am my drunk friend Andrew decided to come over.  Well actually he's been sick and so the medication probably made it seem like he was worse off than he really was, but anyway he was back from DC and came over to see the new house.  Then FINALLY I went to bed after he left.....then I got to sleep in which I LOVE TO DO.  And today I have just been lazy and went out with my mom for lunch and coffee at Barnes and Noble and now I am home again.  Ahhhh it has been a nice day, except for all the rain........Did I some how end up in the rainforest???  I think it has rained everyday for the past week!!  Oh well, I guess we need the rain or we will in a month or so when I stops raining, better soak it up now trees!! Ok it's time for me to lazy around the house some more!  Ttyl
