Today is Friday! Yay! I have more time to play my favorite games.  Those games include Splinter Cell for GC, RoTK for PS2, and I might play a little bit of FFX-2 too if I have time. I still haven't beat it and I got it the day it came out. :(  I should play it more.  I just beat Shinra in the Sphere Break Contest which was really tough and frusterating.
