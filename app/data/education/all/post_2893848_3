Items of possible interest: 1.  I and my books and my pots & pans have arrived at  urlLink my destination .  16 hours of driving over two days--decent time, uneventful.  I spent the night in  urlLink Barkeyville, PA .   2.  In Illinois there was a conspicuous amount of fluffy floating seed-carriage whatevers being blown across the interstate.  Makes me suspect that the cottonwoods are blooming.  If they are, you should take a walk in the park near where I used to live, on the corner of  urlLink Benton & Mormon Trek .  With the seeds drifting down the place looks like a set from  urlLink Legend . 3.  It's hot as fuck all on the East Coast.  My balls are sweating!  Sorry, but they are.  (No link on this one--)   4.  I must have listened to Pavement's  urlLink "Range Life"  ten times in the last 48 hours.  I love Pavement.  They seem always to be saying, "Be sad, just not too sad.  Also, be excited." 5.  I do miss Iowa.  I also hope it never goes away. 6.  I am in the middle of reading Aleksandar Hemon's  urlLink "The Question of Bruno."   I love it so far.  Two awesome descriptive fourishes that seem recently appropriate and of which I am jealous:  tomato slices at a cookout "sunk in their own slobber"; a TV in a motel room "facing the bed patiently, like a dog waiting for a treat."  (Suspiciously enough, I saw no dogs in Barkeyville.)  Anybody reading anything good lately? 7.  I love you all.  D says hi.  Be good.
