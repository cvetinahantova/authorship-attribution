Yay! I can check a few other things off my list of stuff to do! That's the good news. Bad news is, it's time to pay bills AND my prescriptions have run out. Yeesh, that's a lot of money.  Random thoughs running through my head at the moment: -- It's cold. I hate being cold. -- I wonder what soup they have in the student center today? -- I should probably do more work. -- I have to remember to go to the library before class. -- Is there a quiz in Christian Home today? Better not be. -- Must read chapters 8-10 for theater history. -- Need to call Stephanie, need to call Stephanie... -- How much longer until they announce what musical they're doing next semester?  No wonder I'm dizzy all the time.  Anybody out there watching American Idol? What's your favorite audition so far? As far as the bad singers go, I think "Scat Girl" is hilarious. She's the one who tried to sing "Route 66". For the good singers, I loved the pink-haird girl who sang "Rescue Me," the crooner who sang "The Way You Look Tonight" (that voice made me drool!), and the 50's-style girl from San Francisco who sang "Almost Like Being In Love."  Ok, lunchtime, then off to Play Production. Wonder when my script for that is getting here?
