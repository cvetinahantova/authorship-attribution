urlLink Damn the Winter, damn you, and damn the Wright brothers!    Ok, I don't mind the cold. I  like  cold. What I have an issue with is the wind. It turns cold into  fucking freezing , and no tin the fun way. This morning was nice. Heck, even the sun was shining, and temperatures were nice enough that one could walk around with just a sweater on and that was ok. But then it got bad.  The university here is ok, but there are some points I just can't agree with - like copy services charging almost $4 for a 2 page fax. And there is not much activity going on as far as cutting-edge research goes. It's almost as if the professors and students are afraid to take the risks. I think I know what one of the causes of this is - unlike TAMU-CC, here it is not considered ok to have a project which turns out to be crap. At A&M, we are encouraged to take the positive side of it and write a dissertion on why the project failed, which creates a legacy so that other students avoid the same problems. But here they think that a failed project equals a failed researcher. Which has probably a lot to do with the number of business ties that the university has.  BTW, it seems that the source code for Windows NT and 2000 has been leaked. Microsoft has confirmed this to the BBC, and blames somebody in St. Petersburg. Evan for once welcomes our Russian mob overlords. I on the other hand voted for Kodos.
