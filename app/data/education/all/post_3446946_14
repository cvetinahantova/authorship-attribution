I'm going to Israel on June 21st. But we leave from JFK, and so I'll be in New York for a few days before hand. Yes, I know, I need to explain all of this more, I'm sorry, I'm seeing double. But I'm trying to figure out a place to stay, and my sister recommended  urlLink Kasbah.com , and perhaps this  urlLink search  might be helpful.
