The gym really surprised me. I thought I would find it boring, but on the electronic machines, I found it a therapeutic way to relax and work up a sweat while burning calories. I wasn't that keen on the resistance machines (weights) but I did them nonetheless.           Spent over an hour and a half there having really enjoyed myself and even arranged to go again during the week. Its not at the gym I would go to regularly, but it was OK.
