It's official.  I met with Evelyn today and turned in my resignation letter.  It was a... weird day.  I thought that I was going to feel so relieved and so happy after my meeting.  I ended up leaving feeling confused and guilty.  I went back and forth all day.  I feel badly that I'm leaving at this point in the semester.  It's going to really end up leaving some people with a lot of extra work.  At the same time, I know that I'm doing what I need to for me, so it will be worth it in the long run.  Now I just need to get through the next two and a half weeks ...
