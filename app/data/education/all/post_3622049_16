After a long day at work I'm chilling out listing to George Carlin.  He is histerical.  There's nothing like a good comedian to make your day better.  I'm feeling good. "It looks like... MEAT CAKE."  "Well, smell it." "It has no smell whatsoever" "It's good, put it back."-  George Carlin Tomarrow is another road trip.  This is a good one though.  Me and my roomate are going to see some friends. I am just wondering if anyone out there reads this.  And if you do have you noticed my title entries? I really have nothing to say except: Kumkwat.
