We went over to a friend of Sandra's tonight for a BBQ. They used to work together. The evening was very strained, I didn't know anyone, and Sandra only knew one other person. I had 1 bottle of beer, with my burger then moved to soft drinks as I was driving. We came away at 23:00, it was pleasant enough but not exactly relaxing if you know what I mean.
