dancing on the hot coals of rapid change leaves you breathless directionless and leaning heavily on the brakes  oh to be in the world and not be of it then it might be noticed how absolutely  it is a place of sensitivity and sanctuary  i want to celebrate my existence and the ecstasy satiated and underrated or over appreciated of sparked wonderment and its release  in the rhythm of Orion pacing the southern skies waking to the sensual connect of elements colliding throughout the environment  and me  and those times those precious times when i am seen and heard as the explorer i am and am trying to be we are always  one moment away  from happy from home from knowing truth from laughing out loud from being unafraid from embracing love from living large from breaking the barrier and skin of this dream  and i am here and i am now and i am awake and i am crying because the sun will rise over penobscot bay and i will be able to greet it once again  Â©2003 DC Vision
