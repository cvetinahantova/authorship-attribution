MOTHER.  From seeds You watered us.  As we sprouted You helped us grow With the warmth Of your radiant love.  Along the way You trimmed us To keep us safe From Harm.  When we grew out of Our little pods, You replanted us, Where you gave us hope And showed us faith That we may be able To do for others As you did for us.
