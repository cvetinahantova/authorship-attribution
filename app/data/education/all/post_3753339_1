Another day, another weird sleeping schedule...I wish I could stay on track.  Falling asleep wasn't working for me, so I cleaned up the room, prepared my grocery list, and browsed some of my favorite Ethiopian and Indian recipes.  I'll do a cost estimate next time I go shopping--who knows, maybe I'll be able to make myself Atakilt Wat for dinner instead of paying $$$$ at Makeda.  When business hours rolled around (and I still hadn't slept), I called the insurance company to see if I could clarify things.  As with every person at every horse insurance company I've ever dealt with, the woman was rude, cold and made me feel like I was wasting her time (and here I am just trying to be honest with them).  I faxed some stuff directly to an underwriter (and I actually operated the damn fax machine properly for once), so  hopefully  I will hear back from her tomorrow.  I slept for a few hours (four or five...which used to be all the sleep I needed in a night...I hate 23).  I feel like I'm being picked to death by little things...I need to see this person, email that person, check this date, blah, blah, blah.  Erg.  I've been sitting here in my "office," waiting for students who "desperately" needed to see me, and never showed up--I could have spent this time napping!  However, I was able to make it through the book reviews in this month's journal, which makes me feel like I accomplished something academic, which is nice.  I stalled on Margot's gift; I hope to finish it by tomorrow.  At least class this week will not require a lot of thought from me--but I do need to finish all the grading (and by finish, I mean start) in time for class on Wednesday.  I feel constantly rushed because I am dimly aware that July, a month that usually drags, and that I hate, will go by very quickly this year.  At least I get random, unexpected Red Sox tomorrow...of course, with my luck, they'll lose.
