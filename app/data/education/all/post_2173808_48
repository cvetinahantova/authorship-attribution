Of the Democratic candidates, my choice would be Dick Gephardt.  He's been in the trenches for the party for the last 20 years, plus his views on foreign and domestic politics fit pretty closely with mine.  But I just read in the  urlLink Washington Post  that he's been endorsed by singer Michael Bolton.  Yes, that Michael Bolton, forever immortalized in the movie "Office Space" as a "no-talent ass-clown."  I might just have to find a new candidate.
