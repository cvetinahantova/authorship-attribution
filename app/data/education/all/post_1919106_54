The most useless...   ...Test I ever took was the MFAT. None of the skills that come in useful to a computer scientist are included, and pretty much every skill that you will never ever use again unless you're some crazy mathematician (and a computer scientist ain't no crazy mathematician) is evaluated. Someone give me back those two hours of my life!
