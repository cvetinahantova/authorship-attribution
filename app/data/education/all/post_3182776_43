Once upon a time weekends were endless oceans of unfillable time that you could almost literally swim in. Now, you blink and they're gone.  I feel that as you get older, so weekends should become longer. It's only fair, if you think about it, that your extra responsibilities and logistical intricacies are offset by, say, an extra twelve hours lying around time. If we were being really organised we could employ some young folk to pick up the slack, thus creating work experience opportunities for all the draw-smoking chavs that populate our streets every weekend. They've clearly got nothing better to do, so why can't they teach my Monday 3+4? The kids couldn't possibly learn any less than they do with me.  Today me and Hav got up and diligently applied ourselves to wedding arrangements. We now have a catering company, which is very big news, and a big pile of beautifully home-made invitations which may, if we can afford the stamps, be winging their way down your way real soon. What a team we are!  And speaking of teams...  I just watched England spank Iceland 6-1 and I'd love to be excited for them, but quite honestly, I just can't muster the belief. We're playing FRANCE, everyone! Yes THAT France! The one with that monk-looking geezer in midfield who pulls off all the fancy shit, and that good lookin' boy up front who knows Animal and plays for a club side it's impossible to beat. France who won the World Cup. France who have not less than five guys in their team who are THE BEST IN THE WORLD in their position. France, who, unless miracles happen, are going to royally trounce us without shedding so much as a bead of garlic-perfumed sweat. It's David (Beckham) against Goliath. The gourmet against the gormless. It's just not going to happen, and that's that.  Except that... Oh fuck it.  Come on England!
