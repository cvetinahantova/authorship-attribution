Hi! It's Saturday night right now, and my parents are finally home from my cousin's wedding. Last night they were camping and today they came back home, got ready, then went to my cousin's wedding. Right now I'm watching the video that my dad took during the ceremony and I can't believe how beautiful my cousin looks. It seems like everyone was actually able to put aside all of their differences for her and her special day. I can't believe how the people that hate each other then most can come together in one place, to put aside their differences, just so they can make two very special people happy. Looking at the video, all I see is two, very much in love, adults.  It's raining again here in little-ol Aberdeen and I couldn't be happier. I have missed the rain a lot lately. Now that I am listening to the rain pouring down, I feel more refreshed than ever. I just got back from sitting out in the rain before I started in this paragraph so I feel more refreshed and happier than I did before I started writing this post. I love the rain more than most things because the sound is so soothing, that’s a very nice addition to living here in Washington because you know that it is going to rain at least one time during the week. Although there are those rare occurrences to where it goes without raining for a couple of weeks, but all during that time I'm always grouchy. I wondered how many people noticed that about me. Anyways, (finishing yesterday's list and making today’s) I ate: Yesterday: 1 Doughnut 1 Ham & Cheese Hoagie 1/4 of a South-west Salad  Today: 1/2 of last-night's salad 2 1/2 mini doughnuts 1 ham & cheese pocket 1/2 cup of Stir-Fry
