I don’t know why but I just feel like singing.   *hums a little*  I must be happy and all. Family life is getting interesting and my life in God is doing well. I feel good tonight. I have been joking round and fellowshipping with some Brothers and Sisters tonight. I don’t have much to say tonight but I am just trying to continue to gig deeper into the meaning of love.  In study tonight we talked about a video. *can’t remember name* but it was about the area where Jesus did His teachings and all and we read the Sermon on the Mount and all. Which is one of my favorite speeches of all times. Basically read Matthew chapters 5 to 7.   Well, to make a long story short, the beginning of the speech, known as the Beatitudes, links up well to what God has been teaching me about love and all. I write more latter about how, but I am tried and wanted to write this down before I go to bed and all.
