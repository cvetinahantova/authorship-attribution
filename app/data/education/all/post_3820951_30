i am so glad les is a very good and reliable friend...he's always been like that to me anyway. but i so appreciated him last night when he and arf passed by school after my 9pm class ended, just so i wouldn't have to commute alone. and it was raining at that! and he came from ateneo rockwell so i'm really really thankful i can always rely on him like that. he more than makes up for not having a car by making sure i got inside our house safe every time we go out. thanks les!
