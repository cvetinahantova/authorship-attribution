While in Budapest I hooked up with a touring circus company. For about a year, I trained bears to ride bicycles and juggle. Upon returning to the U.S., I became fasinated with the hobo culture. I rode the rails for a few months studing their habits. I am in the works of a documentary on my adventures for the Discovery Channel. For the past year, I have been taking private knuckleball lessons from Charlie Hough in an attempt to break into professional baseball.  Modified 07/22/03
