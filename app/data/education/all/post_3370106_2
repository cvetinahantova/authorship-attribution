Sometimes a vagueness of feeling pervades when distractions invade our lives relentlessly.  They do just that no matter good, or bad, only the results of our conscious actions tell of our intentions.  If commited to living fully in every moment, turning over desire to one loving, guiding spirit-force, matter not, but not anti-matter, with attention focused, only then does action, work, and play spring from the same source.  Living this commitment is likely to deliver more joy and happiness than I could have ever imagined.  Disciplined practice, joyful daily practice, loyal commitment to the path and the source of light, all these I must ingrain throughout my being.  Truthfully, I have yet to fully release myself, but I know that soon the time will arrive and those bonds of fear and denial that I still grip so tightly at times will be loosed then finally and completely dissapated in the mercy, wisdom, and joy of the eternal light within.  I pray, from that time forth, may I take that spirit with me wherever I go, throughout all my days in this life, in these times.
