man, i feel so sick. i wanna cry...but over the net? who the hell am i kidding? jammi's not for me. so much for falling in love..  i feel so guilty of hurting jammi. that was the least i want to do but now it seems clear to me. at some point, maybe mariz is still in love with jammi that's why she's blackmailing him. and maybe jammi still cares for her but he's forcing himself to me so he'd forget mariz. i get it! this is some fucked up novel-like story. me and mariz's new boyfriend are just obstacles in the couple's love affair.  god, i feel like crying...i don't know what to do next.....after blowing off jammi like that....  i'm damn right...this too freakin' good to be fucking true......  back to being a hopeless romantic.......
