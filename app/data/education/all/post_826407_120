been enjoying the  urlLink Douglas Coupland  site.  Found the Hey Nostradamus! section especially powerful.  Especially the little flash animation there.  Gave Helen the book for Christmas but haven't started it yer.  Going to savour it once I've finished the Corrections.  There is a short story competition he's attached to  urlLink here  actually the site that's running the comp is called  urlLink Pulp Net  and looks pretty cool too.   (Thanks Tim)
