It's been a long time.  Not!!!  LOL.  I've been doing evertything from cleaning my room, to doing my homework.  Man am I tired.  LOL  Went to class, and one classmate is like asking all the time for answers.  I don't have them, how could she ask for them?  I did notce she played dumb, and letothers finish her work.  Imagine, her grade came form two other people.  It would have been three, if I didn't keep my mouth shut.
