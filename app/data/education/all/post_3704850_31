When a page is saved, it doesn't always show up in the Webpages edit area, and one of mine actually got deleted somehow (I had to recreate it)   Preview button opens blank window   I can't make a webpage and it's subpages a subpage of another page (I can't move the pages around)   Calling a php function from an included file kills php (nothing more gets sent to browser, html or otherwise). See  urlLink PHP Include Test  for an example (view the source from the CMS)   Not sure if we like the fact that we can't change the order of subpages in the navigation    Can't make a link to an external page (e.g., the library catalog) show up in navbar   Password change in "My Account" doesn't work   I think the CMS welcome page should display the 16 or 20 most recent updates instead of only 6
