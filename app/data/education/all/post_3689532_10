i feel so cool now. i was watching the o'reilly factor-gotta love him and his "no spin zone"-and he mentioned blogs-and now i know what it means.  its 72 degrees here, 85% humidity and its a saturday-guess where I am-yeah work. I had weds/thurs/fri off this week after working my 9 straight days and now I am back for another weekend. i guess i have to put my "dues" in before my leave.   I have a new niece-her name is Emma Jean and she was born Thursday, July 8th at 630pm. She and mom are doing well and Julie has nicknamed her "baby cicada" which I think is very very cute. They tell me she looks a lot like Julie did when she was born so I have a good visual. I will get to meet her sometime this fall.   Later!!
