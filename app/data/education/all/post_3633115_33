This is just a question.  Not intended to open some huge political discussion.  I avoid politics simply because I consider myself not educated enough to hold a real conversation on the topic.  So this really is merely a QUESTION.  What is the point of the 9/11 commission?  To determine that a mistake (or multiple mistakes if you will) was made?  Well, that's all well and good, but what good does it really do?  We cannot go back in the past and make changes....this isn't some Orwellian 1984 society we live in.  Is hindsight not 20/20?  Determining that some mistakes were made is like closing the barn door after the horse got out.  There are always mistakes made by one president or another.  Something that he may have thought to be right at the time only to learn that he was given false information.  Don't try to blame it all on Bush, other presidents have done things that they continue to back even when they are painted into a corner.  For that matter, it certainly isn't only presidents that such things happen to.  Did you think that Martha Stewart wouldn't go back and change the past and not sold her ImClone stock now if she could?  Of course she would.  Everyone makes mistakes, some are just in a more public position and have it displayed to the world to make them look like a total loser.    As far as I'm truly concerned there is no perfect person to run our country since people are not perfect.  Until that honest to goodness person out there who isn't hated by the entire country for being better than everyone else is found and is willing to fix our screwed up nation (much like the movie Dave), then there is no reason to trash any one person over another.  That is all I intend to say on the topic.
