So I'm feeling all *funky* today.  See, I've decided that Monkeypants is in the process of deciding to leave me.  ( I know, I'm insane.)  I think the Little Dictator scares him and makes him uncomfortable and in the end he'll leave.  (See, Hojo.  I told you that the Little Dictator was going to be my downfall.)  In all honesty, I think that we've just made it through the "honeymoon" phase of our relationship and we're starting to see the flaws in each other.  Things that we go "hm.  can i deal with THAT for the rest of my life?" Strangely, me, the Independance Queen, Ms. Stoic, I know there's not anything on the planet that I wouldn't put up with from Monkeypants.  Even the things about him that make me *insane* (find an architecture job, god damn it!  that's what you went to school for!)  are tolerable.  I'm completely content and happy and wonderful and complete.  (Cheesy, yes, but true as well.)  And in all likelyhood, I probably find more fault with me than he does.  I normally do.  I'm too hard on myself, I know, but I'm just not who I want to be as of yet.
