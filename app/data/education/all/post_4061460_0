I spent a lot of time today scouring through photo albums for pictures that I could use on my web site. I came up with about eleven good ones. I still incorporated all of them, but I definitely have most of them up. I also lengthened the section on my web site that kind of covers my past. That is where most of the pics went.  I also took the kids to go see  I, Robot . It was better than I thought it would be. The story was good, and it kept me guessing as to who the real bad guy was. The cinematography was impressive, and Will Smith was very cool.  I have had this crazy desire for Oreintal Chicken Salads from Applebee's lately. I have wanted one for a couple weeks now, so today I broke down and ordered some carry-out. It was soooo good. I'll have to go back next week.
