urlLink    I visited a local flea market the other day.  Mostly flea markets are full of just junk, but the fun is that among the trash, you find little treasures.  I found a turquoise colored glass bud vase that looks like a jewel in my kitchen window.  I found a litttle brass nome.  And I found bunnies.  But I had to be content with taking them home in a photo.
