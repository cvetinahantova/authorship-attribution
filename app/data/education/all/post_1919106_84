Things are working out just fine   Never before have I felt that words of my faith being more true.  "The Lady takes first and then gives it back tenfold."  This last semester a lot has been taken from me, more than I would have wished to lose. But in the end, I got it all back, with interests. Very good things have been happening, and this last week something has been returned to me that I had thought lost forever -  HOPE . I do not doubt that The Lady had a hand in this, and for that I'm eternally grateful. I can now say that all those nights I spent alone in my room, tears threatening to break out, have not been in vain. I am happy beyond measure. Here's a toast to everyone who made it possible! (well, I'm toasting with water, since I'm not allowed to drink alcoholic beverages until next year, but the effort is what counts, isn't it?).
