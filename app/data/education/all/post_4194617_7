When my lovely lesbian wife and I first moved to the Rose City, we lived in a trendy NE neighborhood. It was, by PDX standards, a pain in the ass. Too crowded, too noisy, piggish neighbors, and way too much traffic. Given that Bridgetown is one easy place to get around, that's saying something.  Soon, we came to our senses and moved to what is rapidly becoming another trendy neighborhood. Now we live in hot hot hot Overlook. We are rather pleased with ourselves for picking so well (although we still have some piggish neighbors).  Yes, we lucky denizens of NoPo (that's North Portland to the less hip among us) get to ride the newly opened Light Rail line, a line colored yellow for cheerfulness and optimism. The line has all sorts of cool art embedded in it, on the stations, along the sidelines, in the accompanying new businesses, and there's even poetry on the inside of the trains. It gives us something to look at while we are trying to avoid making eye contact with the crazy/drunk/hostile homeless person sitting across from us.  It is the yellow line of hope that will take me down to the Waterfront on Friday to see John Kerry stumping in Stumptown. I understand such luminaries as Jon Bon Jovie and Leonarda diCaprio (or "de Craprio" as someone once called him) will be joining the party. I'm happy to have them join the dogpile and all, but neither of these glam fellows exactly appeals to the prototypical Portland dweller's sense of style. We're quirky here and we like things a little dark around the edges; not too easily accessed; not too marketable by the mainstream.
