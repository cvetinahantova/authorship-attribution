Time is passing.  There are moments when it feels like April 1 will never arrive, and there are others when I see it racing toward me with a speed that both astounds and frightens me.  I've been busy the past few days, and I'll be even busier in the upcoming week and a half, but soon enough I will be packing up the moving van and heading on up to NY.    Noteworthy news of late?  Eh.  Not too much.  I've started all out packing.  My shelves are starting to look so bare!  The fun part of that is not actually packing the boxes--it's finding the boxes to pack.  That's proving to be quite the challenge.  However, I have made myself a "packing schedule" that tells me how many boxes I need to pack every day.  It sounds anal, I know.  OK, maybe it even completely qualifies as a little anal.  However, if it works, that's all that matters.  And it does put my mind at rest a little, knowing that if I stick to it, I'll be ready to go on time.    Tomorrow is my last Georgian Court Open House.  I get to sit and try to convince potential students that they want to live on campus.  It's almost entertaining...I think I'm going to bring some work with me to do at the table.  Perhaps my self-assessment that needs to be done by Tuesday?  We'll see.  In any case, I'll be packing tomorrow when I get back from Open House.  I have a lot of boxes scheduled for tomorrow.  I guess that means I should get some sleep now.  Later...
