Here's the deal. This is stupid. Just put a filter up.  This law won't affect me but I don't want to keep going back to my credit card number or whatever will be used so my kid can go to games sites that might be blocked. The word 'porn' is funny cause you can think of so many things.  I get the picture of the 42 year old male wasting away with the Kleenexes of sperm layin around or the 18 yr old male who just got a credit card and can't get enough pussy. Get a life.  For one thing, if your kid is discovering this stuff, you're gonna be able to tell because it shows up on the  computer .  Then you can sit down and have the porn talk...it's kind of like the birds and the bees but he'll ask you why girls suck horse dick and how come people shove toys in themselves.  Anyways, this all goes back to the parents who should pay attention and not rely on some porn law.
