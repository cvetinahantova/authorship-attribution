Can a person still be a vegetarian/vegan if he or she swallows certain bodily fluids during oral sex with a male?  My answer:  Yes; otherwise, it would be impossible for a vegetarian/vegan to kiss another individual or to reproduce. Even though human fluids seem as though they are animal products, they are clearly pareve (neutral). Animal products such as fish and eggs are also pareve (making oral sex permissible for vegetarians - since eggs are gametes).  In order to justify the act for vegans, however, a lesser scrutiny standard must be used. Since no killing occurs to produce consumable gametes, they should be treated like plants (a readily replenishable source of cells). Although this same argument can conceivably be used to justify the consumption of eggs and dairy products by vegans, that sort of logic seems flawed. If one consumes eggs and dairy products, he simply prevents the perpetuation of life. This concept should most certainly not bother vegans who are pro-choice and/or use birth control. The destruction of gametes (even potentially viable ones) has already been accounted for as morally acceptable to such individuals and, thus, should be permissible.  However, if the vegan happens to be religiously observant (in any of the major religions), this ruling is null and void. It is highly unlikely that this specific vegan falls under this category since the question establishes her moral standing in the community and deserves privacy protections.  And, no, I did not try to talk a vegan into giving me head, so don't ask.
