Sheesh! I take a weekend off and everybody goes and writes a buncha posts in their journals. Makin' me look like a slacker, y'all are...  Anyway, by Friday night, I finished all but a few things on the list. I still haven't gotten my one-act proposal ready, and I haven't written a paper on  Tartuffe  yet. Oh, and I still need to print out a new resume. Other than that, I got a lot of work done. Yay for me.  So, on Sunday, I come dragging into church, grubby dress, old sweater, ratty hair, feeling gross (because I still don't have a working shower, so I have to shower at Mom and Dad's), and no makeup, and Mom says, "It's time to do something with you." So, we go to the mall, where I get my hair whacked off to shoulder length with layers (which looks great!), and she treats me to 3 new sweaters, 2 new shirts, 2 new pairs of pants, and a pair of boots. I have to admit, I look and feel a lot better.  Well, gotta go eat before Shakespeare class tonight.
