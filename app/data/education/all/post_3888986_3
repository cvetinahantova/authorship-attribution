I cannot wait until my Sundays are filled with fun things.  I long to be part of the culture that goes out to restaurants rather than serving those that go out to restaurants.  What, I ask you, is better than a 'free agent' Sunday?  I would say that lipgloss, pillow top mattresses, bubble baths, and beer and wings would be on the same place on my list as a 'free agent' Sunday.  I will tell you what does not top my list.  Early evening menus and bitter participants of the eating out community, that's what!  So supermodels, now is the time to schedule your Sunday time with me.  I know you are thinking to yourself, Jan, it is five months away until 'free agent' Sundays even begin.  Why do I need to book now?  I'll tell you why.  Because my mind is furiously thinking up ways to spend those very days...and I know that you want to be included in the fantastic world of fun I am planning for myself.  So don't hesitate.  Act now!
