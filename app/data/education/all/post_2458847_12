The new  urlLink Bonnie Prince Billy  album is out. It's not really new, as it's re-recorded and spruced up versions of some of  urlLink Will Oldham's  songs from his early days...back when he had a bit more indie rock and a little less country in his style. Will Oldham has been called by some the best American songwriter of the past 10 years... I say they're right. I've been listening to his music for the past 7 years and still it hasn't gotten old for me.   Anyway, I recommend  urlLink this interview  for those interested in finding out something more about him. Also, check out my Will Oldham link to the right.
