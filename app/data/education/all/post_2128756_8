Ever listen to some really good Philip Glass? I dont mean like Anima Mundi, though it has its place. I mean like the Hours soundtrack. I'm listening right now, and what gets you is the repeated lilting driving rhythym underneath. Thats what it's all about, because, after a while, you lose track of where you were in the music, and it suddenly becomes a series of singular events entering your brain. Ever have moments like that? Where everything ceases to be mushed together, and all the parts come apart and can be seen in crystalline perfection? And of course, once that happens, the true unity is revealed. And it's never what we thought it was. Its not really the sparkling river water rolling over the rocks as the goose descends. Its the light the water the movement the rock the bird the wings the air the change in position in the air.  Its always so much more.
