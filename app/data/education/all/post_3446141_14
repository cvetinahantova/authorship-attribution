I am so glad that it is Friday because that means I get to finally sleep in on Saturday!!  What are my weekend plans you may ask?  Well to tell you the truth I'm not all that sure.  Tonight is up in the air, nothing "planned" so who knows.  Saturday however gets complicated.  I have two friends that want to hang out.  I would have us all do stuff together, but mixing different kinds of friends sometimes isn't the best idea.  But no mater what on Saturday I am SHOPING!!!  That is fuh show.  I have about 1/2 the amount of closet storage now in the new house and well that means I am going to either have to store some cloths away in storage bins that I don't have...OR buy a chest of drawers for all my extra t-shirts and winter cloths to go in.  But the later is more pricey and a bigger decision.  So Rubbermaid here I come!! :)  Ok so I won't be online, more than likely, any this weekend because we still don't have cable in the house for the Internet hookup.  So I will try to leave another message this afternoon. Later.
