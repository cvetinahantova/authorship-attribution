That's for you Jess.  So I made it to Saigon or HCMC or whatever you want to call it.  I've found a nice place that more then suits my needs and now I'm free to blog away as I please.  Today was another killer full day.  My day started at 6:30 and hasn't ended yet.  So today was more boats and buses and whatever the hell else you needed to get around.  We hit a floating market, some type of rice factory, rice fields, rice this, rice that and more rice.  Apparently the south of Vietnam is an important producer of rice.  I met some really cool people on my tour who showed me around this part of town and pointed me in the direction of some decent hotels.  This is the backpacker/budget traveler area (which definatly includes me).  I'm really excited to be in the developed big city.  It just seems there is so much to do here which I'm just ready to eat up.  I have no idea what I'll do tomorrow but I'll try and figure it out tonight.  I think I'll just have a look around and see some museums and monuments and whatever else I can easily make it to.   This is a great computer lab.  I can now read everyone's pages and I have a web cam and mic that I'm using to talk with Gyeh-son.  This place is pretty giver.   Ok well I'm pretty worn out so I think I'll call it.  So far I've really enjoyed Vietnam and I hope it stays that way.
