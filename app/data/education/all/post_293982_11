i say touchdown because it will be short :).  i missed  urlLink stina  tonight because I ended up coming home and cooking dinner right away, so by the time i called her back, she was ignoring her phone. but i made my own pasta sauce, which was exciting, and bread and pasta-from-a-box.  when i grow up, ill have my own pasta maker.  the daily show's interview tonight was wonderful - no, thats not why you had the rapid response team there...BAM!...jon stewart giving a smackdown.  check it out, you westcoast people, dont miss it :).  finally, work wasn't frustrating today, despite making 60 phone calls :).  off to bed, eric must catch the 7:20 train tomorrow, which means im driving him in 7 hours :).
