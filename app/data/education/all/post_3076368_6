urlLink    Look what I found!!!  Posted by  urlLink Hello    So, I learned how to post pictures here ;)  This one is just so much fun that I had to have it on my blog.  Look at the guy's eyes...he look ill or possessed or...drunk, I guess.  What fun.  I was randomly on some Celtic music website, found this pic, drug my cursor over it, and found I could copy it...so I did.  Duh.  I have to pack today.  SCARY!!!  I always forget how much work packing is...you know, washing dirty clothes (or keeping them separate from the others, which is just way too hard).  So off I go.  My foray against the dentists was pathetic.  I lost.  Big time.  That's why I call you (yes, you!) to join my little crusade.
