i've been such a mess lately that i haven't noticed some of the better things in life...  my brother seems to be having a really good time in college. his classmate, sandra the hottie, is totally into him. i'm glad they're having a good time. m gian told me all about her during dinner the other night. man, was he excited. not only that, but sandra's friend, joan, is also checking him out though she isn't single anymore. my bro really is very charismatic...  joana called last night. she also is very happy about her new school. she seems to be having a blast in lourdes with all the co-ed stuff and how she excels there. i'm really happy for her, i'm glad she feels good there and people aren't terrorizing her. plus, she's becoming a heartrub there but she told me she really wants to wait til she's in college before she gets into a relationship. well, i think she's a really good person. she may be living a perfect lifestyle [which i usually would hate] but i really admire her optimistic personality. she's so upbeat and cheerful. she was even sweet enough to tell me she'd call me every week for news. wow, she's so friendly, too!  i bought a couple of cd's yesterday with my uncle and his friend, tito[uncle] rod whom i used to find really cute. nothing much about that, i just had a pretty relaxing afternoon.  *** jammi's probably moving on already..so maybe i have to, too...  "i love you, baby...always will..."
