And while we're on the subject, why on earth do men put up pictures on their profiles that look like mug shots?  Or worse?  I emailed a few times with a man who sounded intelligent and interesting.  Then I saw his photos.  He looks like a mass murderer, for god's sake.  Men can't possibly think that looks don't matter to us.  I mean, walk into a busy bar, and watch the heads swivel.  They aren't checking to see if our IQ is tattooed someplace prominent.  They're just checking to see what IS prominent (ifyaknowwhatImean).
