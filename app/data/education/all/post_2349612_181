blah.  so i thought i was done with lie groups last night... then we got our first assignment back in class today and i decided if no one else was turning it in today, i should maybe work on it a little more anyhow.  that class makes me mad... it could be so much better if the prof came to class organized for once... really.  on the other hand, i got back a decent grade on last week's analysis that i didn't even go to visit jared for help on, and i mostly followed today's lecture... that was good.  all i almost ever talk about anymore is math homework... isn't my life exciting?  daylight savings time in screwing with my head... how can it be 7:30 and this light outside... well, obviously it is, and i've been doing stuff for the whole inbetween time... bought a bunch of easter cards to write to aunts, uncles, grandmothers, and the like and wrote out 12 of them.  fun, eh?  now, back to campus to work on analysis with leigh... to be followed by some fun reading... i'm in the middle of reading  the house on the strand  by daphne dumaurier (her most famous book is  rebecca ... read *that* for HS summer reading one year)... it's fun... people going back in time when they take some drug made out of monkeys' brains or something... bizarre, but i'm hooked and i've barely started.  anyhow, being organized and getting myself outta here... later dudes.
