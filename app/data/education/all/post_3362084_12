Approximately 6 hours and I will be on a train home with Jen and Matt.  This has been a wonderful trip with a great mix of modern technology and culture, like today went from one extreme to the other.  We did some shopping in Downtonwn Hiroshima which was very neat, had a very San Francisco feel minus the hills.  And after that we ate dinner at the Nakamoto's which are Chris and Jen's relatives from around Hiroshima area.  They have a nursery, like for plants and apparently make a good living doing that.  We ate lots of noodles, fish, chicken, vegetables and stuff you'd have at a normal Japanese get together feeding more than 25 people.  It was very interesting because they spoke lots of English and were very enthused about asking all of us question such as "what university you go to?" or "what you like most in Japan?"  Later at night we all went to an arcade just to play some games.  Matt won Jen a little baby Eeyore in a tiny bottle, it cost them about 1000 yen to finally fish from the claw machine.  I played Chris air hockey and did pretty well at first and than I was just watching the puck go into my goal.  Ah and finally we did those little fobby picture booths, if anyone wants to see let me know or ask any of the other people who went on this trip, if you know them.  It will be a while until I'll have something interesting to blog so do enjoy.
