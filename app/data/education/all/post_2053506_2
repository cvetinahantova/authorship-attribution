I was knitting on my ruana today, and I realized that I would need more yarn if I was going to make the whole thing according to the directions, so I logged on to  urlLink Elann  and kept my fingers crossed.  They had enough!  I'm using  urlLink this  in the ebony, stone, and espresso n chocolate.  It's gonna look great.  It's mostly in the ebony.  I wear so much black, it's not funny.  I am thankful they had enough left.  The price was good too.  This yarn is very forgiving, which is good, cause I'm still not an expert knitter or anything, and I drop stitches here and there and never realize it till it's way late.  Thank goodness for bulky yarns.
