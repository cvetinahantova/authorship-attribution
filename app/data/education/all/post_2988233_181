Tommy is no longer on his happy pills?    Thanks to the dr.s office, the health insurance company, and the drug store.    The doc forgot to get prior authorization before calling the script in, the drugstore filled it without the authorization, to the amount of !$150.  THen the chick in charge of authorizations at the docs office went on vacation with no one checking her voicemail, so this went of for over a week, all the time Tommy is without his meds, so when it all got straightened out, he said *&$# it, I don't want them anymore.  Yay.
