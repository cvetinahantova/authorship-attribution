Ok well turns out they have my favorite game but I can't change the controls to the way I like them so I'll just blog instead.  I knew that would happen and I hate it.  Ok I'll pick up where I left of which was with Caleb and I in Bellagio.  We had a fair amount to drink here.  We got things started with a playboy shot and a cran and vodka.  Then we moved onto a drink of my choice and back to cran and vodka.  Sometime during the madness Conan was cool enough to give us a free side dish of our choice.  This worked out really well b/c remember what I said about the "blessing in disguise" thing.  At some point we met some Korean guys and they ended up sitting with us.  Of course this brought us into contact with soju.  I was sitting in the thick of them and thus consumed a heck of a lot.  I think we went through two bottles there.  Gabe and Lois showed up and we finally split out of Bellagio.  Jumi ended up calling me out of the blue and I then hung out with her.  She was hungry so I ate again.  Get this, she wanted to eat sam gyup sal.  I couldn't say no, so I didn't.  It a pretty good place that we went to also.  We had some more soju.  Then we went to a new place, new for me at least.  It was call Haroo.  Really awesome place and packed with people.  We again had more soju and some o-deng soup.  This stuff was really good.  After this I was done.  I was suprised at the fact that I wasn't completely and totally waisted.  I think all the eating helped me out and kept me from dying.  I kind of wished I'd made it to GR but I had a really good time with her regardless.  I never have enough time to blog fully.  Where is my free time?  I'll blog more later.  I'm out.
