From  urlLink Reuters  today:   SEATTLE (Reuters) - A black bear was found passed out at a campground in Washington state recently after guzzling down three dozen cans of a local beer, a campground worker said on Wednesday.    "We noticed a bear sleeping on the common lawn and wondered what was going on until we discovered that there were a lot of beer cans lying around," said Lisa Broxson, a worker at the Baker Lake Resort, 80 miles northeast of Seattle.       The hard-drinking bear, estimated to be about two years old, broke into campers' coolers and, using his claws and teeth to open the cans, swilled down the suds.      We must, of course, factor in spillage.  The bear probably only chugged two-thirds (at most) of every can.  So... two cases would be a better estimate.  Cokemaster guzzled the equivalent of nearly 18 cans on his last outing.  Sounds like a helluva match to me.  But-- please note-- there was no mention of this beast losing his cookies.  Or pissing his fur.  Or dancing with fat bear bitches.
