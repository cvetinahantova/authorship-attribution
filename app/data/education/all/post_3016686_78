From  urlLink Michael Musto  (I saw it before  urlLink gawker !)    BRITNEY SPEARS has been engaged for at least 20 minutes, and I just want to say, bravo, girl! (Oh, I'm sure it won't last through the year, but at least Brit's doing what she wants for a change, complete with Kirstie-style ballooning and dangerous nips of ginseng.  Practically from birth, she's been squeezed dry by the people around her, who've never turned down a single appearance, tour, video, endorsement, or any other chance to make change pop out of her vagina.  They've almost worked the girl to death and now she's finally breaking free, learning the hard way via her own rotten decisions.)
