And more to point I just bought a rail ticket to Moscow; to find an exit from my current situation: Mongolia.  The day after tomorrow I at least should be heading for the Gobi desert, a place many people would consider fairly synonymous with hell. So it should suit me then. I just got started. When I get back in a week or 2 I may actually find something more intelligent to say.  Key points for now: I'm in Mongolia, and doubtless will discourse on the experience at length in due course.  I'll soon be heading home by train and plane to encounter old friends in and around London.  Come September I'll be heading for Tbilisi, Georgia, which should at the very least give me something to write about if it doesn't get me killed. Why this nomadic lifestyle? Well for me personally right now I simply see no alternative. I'll probably go into that at length later as well.
