Today I will succumb to the realization that my life will be used and that I can learn to like being infused daily with the light that is eternal and utimately is the essence of even these transmitted digits.  Circumspect, I know, but without a doubt an important moment in my transformation, or recognition of elemental worth from wich to enrich and grow a life of my making.    No longer will I sit on the sidelines threatening to take my own life while everyone sits by pretending right along with me that everything will pass and brighter days will encompass a new beginning.  But along with the fantasy comes the reality of a world that loves deception, that loves to wear blinders, that begs to believe what hurts worst only makes one stronger.    I'm begging you to believe that what is done is done and that from here on out, love, compassion, forgiveness, humility, patience, a fragrant balance of the finer attitudes in life that allow us to cooperate, compromise, validate, and agree to disagree, going seperate ways free of anger, directing violence neither outward, nor inward.  Still, getting to this point of clarity is unlikely to remain clear if I don't continue to clean the windshield of my mind.
