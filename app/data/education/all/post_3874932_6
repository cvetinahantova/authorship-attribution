Original Message-----From: Marye W. Subject: Senior Paper -- some ideas April 6 email  I was looking over the paper -- Here is an abbreviated story (we can split up some of these themes to investigate once we have a story):  Starts with Lifelong learning (or openness to experience or curiosity)  leads to an interest in cultural currency (you know, I think we could draw on some literature on "memes" perhaps -- we could spend some time really trying to understand the concept of cultural currency) +  Add a desire for cultural currency to the layers of self efficacy -- particularly technological self-efficacy (maybe strongly related to attitudes towards technology, right?) and internet self-efficacy (maybe general self-efficacy, we'll see).   Add And/or desire to connect to others  Can't happen without Stir in moderators /mediators?(barriers/facilitators -- we don't have to talk about this much, but we can acknowledge the descriptive stuff and the adoption/diffusion stuff we don't talk about elsewhere)  Leads to behavioral outcomesConnecting (communication), play, creativity, extension of offline interests into online environment and mostly -- it leads to more learning and desire to keep learning (a giant feedback loop) [or whatever else we want to include here]  Also leads to attitudinal outcomes Spectrum of opinion -- "it's just a tool that can enhance my life" all the way to "it's fascinating, intriguing, it's a magic carpet" [here's something we don't measure on the survey -- but we did code for enthusiasm I think] [maybe there's nothing in the middle of these endpoints]
