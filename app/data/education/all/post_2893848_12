I was thinking about yesterday's strange and lovely little graduation ceremony and how nice it was to have a graduation be so personal and funny. And then I was thinking, I wonder if we appeared to be a bunch of assholes to the outsiders there. You know -- a bunch of smug, self-satisfied, wise asses. And I thought: yes, probably. And I realized that it was the first time in a long while that I've felt on the inside of an incidence of smug wise-assedness rather than on the outside, looking scornfully in. And I have to say, I rather liked it. Does this make me a bad person? Please advise.
