pet peave: people who park so close to the driver's side of your car, you can't even open the door wide enough to throw your purse in.... not a good start to the day when i'm already running late for class and have to climb in through the passenger's side to get in my car!  money just spent on christmas stamps: $42.60 (how did i get to know so many people???)... see if you can tell how many US stamps i bought ($0.37), and how many international stamps ($0.80)... first one w/ the right answer wins 2 points =P
