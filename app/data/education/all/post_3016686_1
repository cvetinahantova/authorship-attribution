This week's new group choice is Delays. Note that is not  The  Delays. This group is sweet.  Very atmospheric, with perhaps the best CD title I have heard in a long time: " urlLink Faded Seaside Glamour "  (how Morrissey is that?)  Play the sample on the link above.  I like "Long Time Coming."  It's all boys, but you wouldn't know it.  They're vaguely REM-like.  This  urlLink page  has some news clippings at the bottom
