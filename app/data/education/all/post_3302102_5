Wow, I have been slacking on this thing.  Where to start!    Well, I have a new sign name.  My first one was 2 "P" hands lifting my boobs.  This was assigned to me because when I was drunk at a party with some Deaf friends, I grabbed my boobs, moving them up, unlike my peers who just grabbed them.  That was a fun party.  My second sign name was 1 "P" hand brushing the shoulder to show attitude, because my friend Matt is scared of my in your face attitude.  That sign name was modified when I entered ASD to the "P" hand signing the word "CRAZY"  Last week I went out and got TRASHED with Quad 1 teachers and staff.  Apparently I was laughing like Scooby Doo.  So now, Brad and Shane sit in the back of the classroom and say "SCOOBY DOO!" or "SHaaggy!"  My new sign name, therefore, is two "P" hands in front of the chest looking like paws and the tongue out...looking like a dog begging!  Time to teach!  I have a whole lot more to add later!
