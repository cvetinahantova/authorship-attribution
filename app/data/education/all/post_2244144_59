Those that have been with me for a while might have noticed that I am becoming more of a blogger (in the sense that I update several times a day with shorter posts) than my past one long piece per day. The reasons for this are twofold.  First of all, I am now a  urlLink TotalFarker . This basically means I get about 1000 links per day to all the news links around the globe. It is truly a great experience. I sit in front of the computer basically all day and find myself enthralled by all those farking links. This in turn is why I am posting a lot more simple one line posts with a link. I figure that I should share all this wacko news with my audience.  Secondly, I am in the stage of migrating to a better experience than the one that you are currently at. What does that mean? Well lets just say that you will no longer have to type in some foreign extension (.tk) because I will soon be having my very own .com site. Also, (hopefully) I will be able to migrate away from  urlLink Blogger .  Thirdly, I am stuck inside the house most of the day. This limits the amount of things I can criticize about. During the school year, I would simply bitch and moan about all the little nuances that I noticed along the way. Now all I can do is start an  urlLink imaginary battle , belittle some political things that I do not care about, or write some movie/book reviews (which I will probably be doing soon).  I hope that makes some sense. If not,  urlLink pray now that your children do not look like this woman when they grow up .
