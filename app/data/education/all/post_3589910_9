Well, we finally got the phone line back. Lots of things have been happening.  I'm going to be the Princess from  "Las Fiestas Patronales".  Its a custom every year here.  So we are on low budget but still managing.  I'm starting university soon, on the 9th.  I'm So anxious about that.   I've been having lots and lots of dreams about my twin soul.  I know I'll meet him soon. I just don't know when or where.  But he's great.  Now I know why I'm always atratcted to the same lone wolf, petty eyes, black hair stereo type. We are conected, and I just feel this will be the one lifetime that everything will be great, or at least I hope so.  I do know he has a hard to handdle chatacter. Almost the contrary to me. But as my dream guide said, "They are different, so they complement each other."  I have many guides and angels.  I've meet... the old man with white hair twice in my dreams, a red haired lady, very pretty, two angels and a tiger. They always say things to me in my dreams, beautiful dreams. And once hile meditating I was able to see them all, I recognized a few, but others not. It was just for a second though. My dad made a loud noise and woke me. I also have some faeries and pixies, REALLY, I do. But only in my dreams I can see them all or in meditation.
