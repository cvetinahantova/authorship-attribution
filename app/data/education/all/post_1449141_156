From Weijd Chung To: AL subject: Holy war for Democracy  Here's a link to arguably one of the best, and in my opinion, objective analyses of the the Bush foreign policy. It includes a history of conservative politics and the development of neo-conservative thinking. � http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EE13Ak02.html � Below is an excerpt of a rather lengthy commentary: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- � The war against Iraq was not about oil, or about keeping oil denominated in dollars. These objectives, while not trivial, can be achieved by means other than war. The war was about eliminating the will of any state to defy US global intentions, which neo-conservatives define as faith-based benign hegemony. It was above all a warning of similar fate to all who would be foolish enough to follow the footsteps of the Taliban or Saddam Hussein and stand in the path of America's march toward its strategic objective of establishing a world order based on US imperium through preemptive war.  Taken at face value, the war as explained by the White House is part of a US strategy to spread democracy, to safeguard freedom and to reinstate popular control of national resources and destiny around the world. Americans generally understand democracy to mean a representative form of government based on majority rule with minority rights, administered by elected officials of fixed terms, with separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judiciary branches, and the institution of peaceful change of administrations through general elections. The American notion of freedom focuses on freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association and freedom to disagree with and oppose government policies through legal means. Associated with these political freedoms are institutions of free enterprise and free markets. Any nation deemed deficient in any of these characteristics is fair game for regime change through the application of overwhelming military superpower, unless it possesses credible counterattack deterrence.  The Bush administration's neo-conservative view of terrorism is that it has become the major threat to US national security. This view is understandable since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Less understandable is its assertion that terrorism is caused by a lack of democracy and freedom associated with domestic oppression, and not by neo-imperialism and the poverty it creates. Curiously, the US domestic recipe for fighting terrorism requires the suspension of civil liberty. Furthermore, terrorists are deemed to be enemies of democracy and freedom.  Thus only half the objective of a preemptive war has to do with the elimination of weapons of mass destruction from the control of "rogue states", the other half has to do with the forceful spread of democracy and freedom around the globe to strike at the root of terrorism. The grand strategy of US neo-conservatism is to bring the full force of US superpower to bear on the crusade to spread democracy and freedom around the world, through regime changes by military force if necessary. � [...] � Thus the failure of the oceans to protect the US from external threat now compels the US to attack all around the world who are not with it in its war on terrorism. It is conceivable that the US can prevail over all other national governments militarily, but it is pure fantasy that the US can spread US-styled democracy and freedom all over the world, even with a new 100-year war. Or that true democracy and freedom around the world would support US national interests. A healthy dose of realism and multiculturalism will save the world from impending self destruction by superpower theocracy. Either way, it spells the end of the age of superpower because military power, as demonstrated in Afghanistan and Iraq, causes more problems than it solves.
