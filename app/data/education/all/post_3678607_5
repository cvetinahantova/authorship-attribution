My Brother has taken to using the following words : "Ghetto", "Pimp", and other slang words of that type. I have read the dictionary definitions to him, and still utilizes them in has everyday vocabulary. Frankly, I find it highly inappropriate for my 14-year-old brother to use these words. Whatever. We bought fireworks today, so exciting. Yeah, right. We are being subjected to my dad's friends 4th of July party for the second year in a row. Oy. And my grandmother is coming. More fun. *sigh*
