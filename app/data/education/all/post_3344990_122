I received some cool pictures of Jeremy dressed up in his band uniform performing with the rest of his squad.  Here is one of them.       I was told that at the end of the session that Jeremy collapsed and had to be taken to the hospital via ambulance.  Apparently he is fine and was just dehydrated.  I am certainly glad that he is ok.  I can remember how hot it gets in Houston Texas so I can only imagine how hard it would be to carry that Tuba around in the heat with those hot uniforms that they have to wear.    Good Job Jeremy !!
