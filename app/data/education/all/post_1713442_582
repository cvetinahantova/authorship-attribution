urlLink School Completion 2000: Dropout Rates and Their Implications for Meeting the National Goal. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Howley, Craig and Huang, Gary.  From the ERIC Digest:  The second goal adopted at the 1990 Education Summit in Charlottesville, Virginia, aims to increase the high school graduation rate to 90 percent by the year 2000. To interpret this goal and to work toward it, educators and policymakers need current data on school completion and early school leaving. What is a "dropout"? What is the extent of early school leaving? How does the dropout rate vary among different groups and regions? Finally, what do available data imply about possible strategies for meeting the goal? This Digest draws on recent studies to answer these questions.
