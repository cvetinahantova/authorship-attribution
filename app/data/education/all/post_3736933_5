Well I just got off a 10 hour flight, and now I am waiting in Singapore airport, it is just after 6 in the morning over here, it is two hours behind Sydney. I am getting ready for my connecting flight to home sweet home. I am planed out, and airport outed, I mean I just want to go home and find my bed. I am sick of getting pushed around in the airport, and waiting in queues for everything.  Right now I really can't wait to be home, I am really tired, I couldn't sleep much on the flight, I watched so many movies and did some boring crosswords.   Well I will see you all in Sydney then.
