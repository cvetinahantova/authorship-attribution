Bad news from New mexico on their living wage law...   Tuesday, June 29, 2004  Coke Co. To Take 'Wage' to Court  By John T. Huddy Journal Staff Writer ��� A lawyer for Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Santa Fe said Monday he planned to seek an injunction in federal court to stop Santa Fe's "living wage" law until a federal case against the measure is decided. ��� "When (the motion for an injunction will be filed) ... I just can't answer that," said attorney Paul Kennedy of Albuquerque. ��� Kennedy confirmed he has talked to Coca-Cola and plans to file for a temporary injunction, "probably sometime in the next month." ��� Affected businesses are getting their payrolls ready for increased wages and city leaders have been gearing up to enforce the law if necessary. ��� A federal injunction would supersede state First District Judge Daniel Sanchez's decision Thursday to uphold the measure. It requires Santa Fe businesses with 25 employees or more to pay an $8.50-an-hour minimum wage. ��� An injunction could be narrow in scope, said Morty Simon, a local labor attorney and founder of the Santa Fe Living Wage Network. That is, it could stay enforcement of the law at all businesses in Santa Fe or only at Coca-Cola. ��� "Another issue is, ultimately, if we (living-wage supporters and the city) win the litigation, will it be retroactive," meaning, will businesses that haven't conformed to the law have to pay back wages, Simon questioned. ��� The Santa Fe minimum-wage law was supposed to take effect in January, but Sanchez, anticipating a trial, delayed it. He ruled the law was not retroactive in last week's ruling. ��� Local business owners and managers in state court challenged the state and federal constitutionality of the law. A group of business owners that opposed the law said it plans to appeal Sanchez's decision. No appeal had been filed as of Monday. ��� Meanwhile, Coca-Cola contends in its lawsuit that Santa Fe's measure will cause irreparable harm to affected businesses, among other arguments. ��� "I guess I'll have to increase the wages of my dishwashers. ... They were the only ones making less than $8.50," said Joe Hoback, owner of the Pink Adobe restaurant in Santa Fe. Hoback said that if a federal injunction halted the law, "then I would probably go back to paying them the original wage." ��� City Attorney Bruce Thompson and City Manager Jim Romero were not available for comment Monday. ��� City Councilor David Pfeffer, the lone dissenting council vote when the minimum-wage law passed in February 2002, said he had "a hunch that many, many businesses will just go ahead and bump their employees up to the $8.50 wage, who aren't making it now," despite a potential injunction. ��� Hoback and other local business leaders agreed that they're not that worried about the increase to $8.50 per hour. ��� At most local restaurants, waiters and waitresses already make above the $8.50 wage if tips are included, which the law allows in computing the wage equation. ��� It's the increase to $9.50 an hour in January 2006, then $10.50 an hour in January 2008 that concerns business owners and managers such as Hoback. ��� Coca-Cola human resources manager Kathy Medina said Friday that the company was updating its payroll to bump 13 of its 94 employees up to $8.50. ��� Medina said paying $8.50 wage to the 13, who were making an average of about $7.95 an hour, would likely not "hit us that hard" economically, she said. She said increasing the wages further will. ��� Hoback agreed. ��� "And we also have to take into consideration compaction," he said. That is, paying more to an employee who made $8.50 an hour because of the increase of lower-paid employees' wages. ��� Monday, city attorneys and officials met to discuss the city's enforcement actions. ��� Under the city wage law, employees who feel they are not being paid the living wage can file complaints with the city manager. Investigation of those grievances will be handled by Romero's living-wage designee, Carlos Martinez. ��� The law holds that employees cannot be terminated because they filed a complaint with the city, under the code's retribution clause.
