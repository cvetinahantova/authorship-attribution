AnosticaÂ is IN!! yehaa!!   ALL those posts I've put on here...GOSH! Ever since this past summer, all about me getting ready to apply, and waiting for responses, and then an interview...well two of them. Only one of which I have attended. It was at Purdue University..and I'm happy to announce that I have been admitted to Purdue University!!!! Yehaaa!!! Yes, and they have offered me a full-ride with all my tuition paid as well as a stipend or money for me to live with!! I'm happy :))))) I guess I"ll see how the other school is when I visit it in a few weeks..
