so i do believe i have peaked on the stupidity scale. i'm doing this HYU camp thing (read:"jesus camp").  i thought the first day was today. so me and my dad drive an hour and 45 min out to maryville, mo,get a little lost on campus, and eventually find the place. no one's there. i was getting a little irked. then this lady tells us it starts tomorrow. well woopee. then we drive the hours and 45 back to kansas city. fun times, ya?
