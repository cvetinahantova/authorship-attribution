Was round at Tim's last night for tea.  As we left Helen mentioned  "When your out with boys you only ever talk about music and films"    ooops  Saw Buffallo Soldiers on Friday,  cool.  Its heartwarming to know their are dissenting voices in the USA.  Speaking of dissent:  urlLink Not in our Name Music  is v. exciting.  Maybe I've discovered it a little late but it's still relevant.  Awoke on Saturday morning to views of builders all around our house, apparently we're about to be sandblasted- sounds exciting.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY FRANCIS!!!!!
