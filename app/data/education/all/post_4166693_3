Today is my long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long day. I'm in the office from 8-2:45 and then I'm off to the library from 3-8 for class.  Soooo long.  The real excitement was that my class was posted as starting at two different times, both of them listed in the syllabus, and I had no clue when to be there. So, luckily, it's the later time and I don't have to be in class from 12 p.m. - 8 p.m. That would have sucked.  I have to make some phone calls to agencies today to find out what their problems are with the contracts that we submitted.  Otherwise, I am hoping for a liesurely day in the office. Friday's are typically pretty quiet. I hope it stays that way.
