"Pictures, Stars, And Dreams"  i picture you sighing soft only in my dreams whisper kisses only in my dreams and they're always here to remind me... pictures stars and dreams calling me when i look up you're the brightest star in a pocketful of skies my colored picture in a world of black and white my only dream come true on a restless winter night when i look back on a picture of the past i close my eyes and make believe i was still there cause all i have left are pictures and stars and dreams to hold on to i'll never wish on another star again   TJT rocks so hard. It has been a long short week so far and I'm glad to finally get to the freakin' weeken'.
