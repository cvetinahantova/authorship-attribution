Thanks to my cousin  urlLink Lisa  for telling me about TalkBroadBand technology.  Check it out:   urlLink Broadband Voice Gateways are cool .  Here's how it works:     This will allow me to have a 'portable landline' with a local 416 phone number (no long distance charges apply) that I just plug into the Voice Gateway from my high-speed internet jack. It can be either cable or DSL. Pretty cool, non?  That's a way to stick it to the Long Distance Service Providers...
