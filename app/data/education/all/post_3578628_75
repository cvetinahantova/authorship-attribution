At one point in the night, there's a time where you can do nothing about not having sleep.  It's when the birds come out and start chirping.  The coffee starts dripping.  And the sun is about to rise...  I am stuck here at 5:30 am without the luxury of being asleep.  And it sucks!  I don't know what it is but I had nothing better to do.  So I wrote about it.  Hey, there's music videos on.  Beyonce's hot.  I can't even try to sleep because my mind just races around and I feel insane.  Scary?  Yes very.  Alright I'll stop.
