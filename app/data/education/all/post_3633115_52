Okay, I just got done checking on my  urlLink site meter  and holy crap am I popular today!!  I have had over 50 people come to my site. And only three were from me before I remembered to block my IP address from being recorded.  WELCOME READERS!  I feel so special.  I was pretty happy to know that  urlLink Kalisa ,  urlLink Tiffany , and  urlLink Zam  had made the transition, but to find out that others are there....well that just makes me want to take a Sally Field moment.  But I won't.  Ha! Y'all were really expecting it weren't you.  So Sorry. No not really sorry. Just feeling tired and therefore a bit giggly, but not sorry.  Nighty-Night All!
