I set about to the long but wonderful task of summarizing Jessica's and my whirlwind relationship.  I spent a better part of a lunch hour typing it up.  One thirty rolls around, I pick up the laptop to go back inside... and let me ask this - Who puts the battery release switch on the front/side of a laptop?!   The battery slid out gracefully onto the picnic table and my story vanished into digital oblivion.   Oh hang it all.
