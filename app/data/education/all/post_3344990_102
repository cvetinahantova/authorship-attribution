I received an e-mail this evening with some attachments of my son Jeremy in the marching band at a local football game.  Jeremy attends Terry High School in Rosenburg Texas which is just outside of Houston Texas.  Jeremy is 17 years old and will be graduating High School this year.     urlLink Jeremy Moffitt Terry High School Marching Band   You can see Jeremy standing on the 50 yard line with his tuba in this picture.
