So I recieved a call from Coppell ISD about a possible teaching job at  urlLink Lakeside Elementary .  I am a little nervous because of my past three interviews being flops.  I am excited though because they are offering me a Second or Kindergarten position.  I would LOVE to teach second grade again.  Say a little prayer for me and hopefully I will get the best job for me.  I'll post a message when I know the verdict about my job.
