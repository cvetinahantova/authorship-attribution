Well here it is the 4th of July already. June flew by and before you know it will be time to get ready for school again. I received my Substitute Teacher identification card from Charleston County the other day. SO I am set up to substitute for them this coming year. I should get one from Berkeley County as well. I am still working at Wallyworld part-time and manage to get in about 30 hours a week. Right now i am working usually from 4 or 5pm until 10:30 to 11pm. I usually get Wens and Thursday off.  This morning we dropped the kids off at the Clarion Hotel in North Charleston, where the Charleston Police Department has a bus they use to take the kids up Camp Bob Cooper which Happy Days has their camp every year. It was the first time we have ever had them take the bus. I was happy to hear that it was a NEW bus they had gotten this past year. I know the kids will have a blast as they do every year. James and I both have to work tonight until 11.  I should be hearing if i passed my test for the Praxis II on July 12th. I sure will be glad to hear if its a yeah or a nah. The waiting is driving me crazy! Guess thats it for now.
