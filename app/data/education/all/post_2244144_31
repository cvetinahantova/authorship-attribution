Tattooing in of itself is a tolerable form of self expression. But of course there are many ways to screw it up. Some common examples of this are putting some dumb whore's name on your ass for the rest of your existence, having more symbols on the body than pores, and marking yourself with a college university's logo that you have never even attended. Then there is one that surpasses them all, tattooing yourself with the cross.  These same people that do that infathomably idiotic thing are also proud supporters of their local church. This means that they are some form of catholic or christian. In these two forms of religion, the only source of knowledge is The Bible. Now let me pose this simple question, what does The Holy Bible say about tattooing oneself? From  urlLink Bible.com :  "Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print or tattoo any marks upon you: I am the Lord." So basically they affirm their religious beliefs by sinning against that same religion. That is like saying you love someone and the way you show it is slap in them in the face twenty times (unless of course they are into bondage).  After you consume that conundrum, I must ask you this simple question. What is the last thing Jesus wants to see when he comes back (if he returns)? You guessed it, a cross.  So by what they believe to by an avouchment towards their beliefs, they in reality sin against their religion in general and also piss off their Lord on a personal level.   I can see it now up in heavens:   Angels : Um, Jesus weren't you supposed to return to Earth like four years ago.  Jesus : Well as long as my supposed believers keep showing off those damned crosses, I am never going to return. I hope they all burn in hell.
