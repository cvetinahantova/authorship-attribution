I teach piano lessons. It is a job.  It is not just "something that I do on the side". It's a freakin source of income, for cryin out loud!!!!  You see, I have a student (name with-held). She comes once a week for an hour lesson in between two other students. Last week, her parents failed to bring her. I called, left a message on their answering machine, and alas, no reply.  I saw them earlier this week and they said nothing to me. They did talk to my husband, but not to me. Hmm.....strange.  Today, she was to have another lesson. Guess what? Her parents failed to bring her again. Still no phone call. I called their house 15 minutes after our lesson was to start and left a message. Still no reply as of yet. What is goiong on, I ask????  Another problem with this family is that they are constantly bringing their daughter to lessons late (usually anywhere from 10-30 minutes late (yes, that's half of her lesson and yes, they are required to pay for the whole hour). Why would you do that???? It just doesn't make any sense. And when I ask if they need a different time slot for lessons they make up some lame excuse about traffic being bad or a Dr. appointment that ran late. I'm so tired of it. *sigh*  And it's a shame, too. Because their daughter is very sweet and talented.  Oh one more thing....I had bought 2 new books for this student and was expecting pay for them last week. Still no pay....because they don't show UP!!!!!! I'm now out $30 for the lessons they have missed and $10 for the books. Yeah.....they will be paying me. One way or another. I don't want to sound harsh, but c'mon people! At least give the curtousy of a phone call to let me know that you won't be here. My introductory letter stats that "if sufficient notice is not given for cancelling a lesson, the weekly fee will still be issued".  Well, I guess I'll go do something useful.  Signing off.....
