How very cool!  I am crushing hard.  I just got off the phone with hmmmm, gotta think of a good name for him... Fred.  Yep, he's mine and I'm gonna call him Fred.    Fred and I were matched on eH, and he pinged me first... you have to request to start communication (whatever) and he did it first.  So we've been going thru the steps for a few days over a month now.  He's older than I am, and has a great job, lives in a nice area, wants the whole white picket fence thing....  Just wow.  We tried to IM, but he isn't the fastest typer.  Switched to the old fashioned phone, and neat.  He is cute, as far as the pics I saw, and sweet/funny... we have TONS in common, and are meeting for coffee on Wed am.    The only red flag is that he wants to have a baby... well, HE doesn't want to have a baby.  He wants to marry someone who will have the baby.  And that's not even a red flag, it's kind of a nice thing, but I'm still not sure about doing that again.  Wow, wow, wow!  He is a real catch!    He thinks I'm cute!  :)  And funny.... ok, he is prolly someone just trying to get laid, but I don't think so - at least I hope not!  I gotta go to bed!
