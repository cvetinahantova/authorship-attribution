As its half term H has taken a couple of days off so we can spend them together.  Yesterday we went into Sheffield and had a bit of a walk round the city centre.  Our main aim was to look at some different art exhibitions there.  This was thwarted somewhat because we couldn�t find the Bloc Space and had forgotten the Site Gallery was closed on Mondays.  We did get to the Millennium Galleries, however, and looked round the  urlLink Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller exhibition  there.  This is the first large scale contemporary art show that the Millennium Galleries has done and is a fantastic start.  Cardiff and Miller work with Film and Sound to create exhibits that cleverly play with reality and narrative.  There are 5 works on display.  The first four use the conventions of cinema to examine the effects sound and image have on the audience.  I found them very playful and slightly disturbing.  There were moments when I was unsure what was �real� in the exhibition and what was not.        In the final piece, Forty Part Motet, Cardiff creates something almost transcendental that contrasts greatly with the other clever, cinematic pieces.  A 16th Century choral work, "Spem in Alium Numquam habui", by Thomas Tallis, is played over 40 speakers arranged around the room.  Each of the speakers represents a single voice in the choir.  The affect is awesome.  The sound of the choir creates a place of sanctuary that you get lost in and for me also it created a place of worship, a thin place.  The title of the choral piece means �I have never put my trust in anyone but you,� so led me to make obvious spiritual connections.  As I looked around the room I realised that it had much the same effect on everyone there.    After all that we had lunch in the Winter Gardens, man I love that place.
