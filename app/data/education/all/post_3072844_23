helloooooy again. I am sat in the it rooms waiting for my teacher and we are all bored.  So i thought i would write a post. So i have just had RE and got my exam results back So far my results are...... ( drum roll please! ) Latin ( this lesson!) 59% English 81% RE 81% So my latin exam is really really really really awfull. Never mind.  I am not talking to libby or ross which i think is the best idea seen as they may as well be getting married seen as they already have the rumour spread that they have slept together.  But why??? They have like been together for 3 weeks! Never mind it is nothing to do with me anymore. I don't really care.  They are nothing to do with me.    So anyway Yes.   Ummm no i dunno  So umm yeah Charlie the first weekend in july doesn't ring alarm bells so i think that is fine for the picnic. so umm yeah i shall do some incites and email them u so we can hand them out to ppl who wanna come to our small little town and have a random picnic for those hu are crazy.   So umm i sahll go now cos i have nothing other to do apart from surf the internet  Taraa  Gracie  mwhua xx
