urlLink DotTK  I have found that many of my students do not really understand how domain names work or how they are assigned.  I have talked with students who think that a .org means that the site must be an organization or that .com must be a business.  This is untrue as anyone can register either extension for any purpose if the registration fee is paid.  The tiny New Zealand island territory of Tokelau has been assigned the extension of .tk.  And wonder of wonders, they are giving out addresses for free.  The domains you can get (up to three) will be redirecting frames to another address you specifiy, but they are real top level domains.  Go ahead and try  urlLink libraryinstruction.tk .  It redirects to  urlLink LibraryInstruction.Com .  I am thinking about showing this site to my students and having them register a free domain.  It might help facilitate a discussion on domain names and their meanings.  I wouldn't mind visiting Tokelau either.  Sounds like a neat place...
