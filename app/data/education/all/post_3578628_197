You know one thing this journal site does is it brings everything I know in the world into my home.  I have you all.  I have news.  I get to always be reminded of movies.  I'm constantly thinking what can I do for these people.  And then it hits... Suddenly people aren't satisfied.  Well, I just showed this site to a friend before the idea of making it better came through.  She said that she thought it was cool.  But I am just sick of all the comments where it sounds like people are trying to start something.    Like for the Thoughts on Indecision Pt. 2 ...  At 12:18 PM, Spencer said...  Sorry we're inadequate.  At 5:12 PM, Barbie said...  I'm glad to know that you feel that you are STUCK with us, i didn't know you felt that way...   Go back and read.  You'll see that I wasn't attacking anyone.  I want to remove your comments from the site because they ruin the atmosphere that I would like to have.  Here's an idea:  Post a response.  Tell me exactly why it makes you uncomfortable rather than making up some dumb comment.  This is going to sound hypocritical.  I'm known to be sarcastic.  But I think I'm really trying hard to just be open minded and consider what everyone has to say and not stunt it with some stupid sarcastic remark and that should be something everyone all tries.  Quit thinking I am attacking you personally.  I won't and I have no intention of knocking some of my closest friends down.
