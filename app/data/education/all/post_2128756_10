And this is life, I suppose. I feel as though I keep driving around, or moving from room to room, expecting to see my self coming the other way.  "There you are!" I'll say. "I've been looking for you!" Looking for me. There are days that I feel like such a little person. There are days that I feel like a giant. Which is best? Alice couldnt decide, so is there any hope for me? Taylor. Taylor was fun, but after tonight (and the phone call from his mother, asking where he was, and with whom), I don't think we'll be talking very much.  Still, there's always the river. "Ever get the feeling that the river knows what it's doing?" There's always the river.
