We are drifting apart don't know since when  I know we have many differences It used to be allright We are different,but we care for each other  No more calls, no more messages I really miss those Even...I feel like we are just strangers who just knew one another for a day  Isn't that sad? where do our friendship go? or is it true people change? do you have change of heart?
