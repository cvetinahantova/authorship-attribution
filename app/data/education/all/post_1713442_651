urlLink Faculty Compensation Systems: Impact on the Quality of Higher Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Sutton, Terry P. and Bergerson, Peter J.  From the ERIC Digest:  Factors That Affect Faculty Compensation  Institutions possess limited control over the amount of funding available to finance faculty compensation. For example, decisions which determine the amount of funds available for faculty compensation are often affected by external or environmental forces that the institution cannot fully control. The variety of forces that affect the amount of funding for higher education faculty compensation suggests an ongoing, continual, cycle creating a loop. Figure 1 presents a hypothetical feedback model that calls attention to the wide range of factors that educators need to keep in mind when attempting to change faculty compensation.  This model implies that each institution needs to scan its environment continuously to be aware of public perception and the attitudes of political actors in order to be able to respond effectively to the demands of these groups. The modern higher education environment forces each institution to be cognizant of its role as an economic, social, and cultural agent for the stakeholders it serves. The model presented in Figure 1 reflects the following:  1. The public's perception of how well an institution is fulfilling its mission will impact the amount of institutional funding the public will support (Foldesi, 1996, p. 30; Breslin and Klagholz, 1980, p. 44).  2. The level of funding an institution acquires directly affects the level of faculty compensation.  3. The level and the structure of the faculty compensation system affect the success the institution achieves in fulfilling its mission.
