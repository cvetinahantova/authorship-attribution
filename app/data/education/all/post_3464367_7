I don't get it!  urlLink I just don't understand .  Why do things work out the way they do?  Why does God let things happen the way they do?  Wouldn't it be better if things happened another way?    I think not!  We only see a piece of the "Big Picture", our lives, while God sees and knows everything.  A good example of what could happen if man had the power of God is Jim Carrey's movie "Bruce Almighty".  A mess, that is what you would have.  God is all knowing and all powerful and has the advantage of knowing EVERYONE"s tomorrows.  Now myself, I only know today and can barely remember yesterday.  How could I have the knowledge to know how it SHOULD turn out.  Accept today, enjoy today, and be convinced that when you look back on your life, you will know it worked out the way it was suppose to.   See the movie today, it will make you laugh and put a smile on your face and let you know the Father has it under control even though you may feel like youi really messed up in your past. He is the God of second chances.  :)
