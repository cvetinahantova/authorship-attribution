Last night I had my farewell enkai with the teachers of Shiogama Boys School.  They are absolutely fabulous and it was so much fun.  A bus came and picked us up from school and took us to the Kirin Beer Port.  The first Kanpai (toast) was made and the drinking and eating began.  I was chatting half in english and half in Japanese with the various people sitting around me and Yuko and I were definitely having fun.  Then it became time for my speech.  I stood up and said good evening in the Tohoku dialect and then continued giving my speech in Japanese.  I got a couple cheers and applauses along the way and eventually completed it.  I had a card with the japanese written on it which turned out to be a wise move as I had to give this speech after already a few rounds of drinks.      The night continued with various teachers making speeches and telling me how much they loved having me at their school, how I have really impressed them with the way I learned Japanese and about Japanese culture, and just how they are going to miss me a ton.  The vice principal who is a great guy and teaches me various Japanese phrases used a special Japanese phrase that basically meant that while he is very sad that I am leaving, he will never forget me because the memories we shared will last forever.  They really are an incredible group of people and I am going to try and make the most of my last 2 weeks with them and hopefully Yuko at least will come and visit me whereever I am in the world.  She has helped me more than anyone in Japan and I never expected to become such great friends with a teacher I initially only saw 2 days a week.  It is strange because we have a very similar sense of humor and are continually joking around but whenever I was having problems with my other school, trying to figure out how to do things in Japanese, or just needing a little guidance she was always offering to help.          Here is just another little story from last nights enkai...one of the Japanese history teachers got up to make a speech and he is one who always has conversations with me entirely in Japanese.  He even told Yuko a couple months after I arrived how great my Japanese is and that I understood everything.  Little did he know I was just saying hai to everything and nodding in agreement.  Well, last night he stood up and went into this speech about how America dropped the atomic bomb on Japan and how much he hates America.  Immediately all of the other teachers told him to sit down, his time was up, and they even did a countdown to get him to stop talking.  Yuko fell over in the chair next to me she was laughing and I guess a bit embarrassed.  He wouldn't stop so I whispered to Yuko that she should remind him of Pearl Harbor.  She did and his response to that was that they are really sorry about Pearl Harbor.  He then went on to say how much Japan has helped America so Yuko and I (a little tag team) chimed in with the fact that America has also helped Japan a lot.  Anyway, he finally stopped after saying that he likes me a lot but not America.  Yuko and I then had a conversation about how all of the students THINK he is weird but the teachers KNOW he is.  Yuko and I, still laughing and trying to recover, then joked about how he likes me but not America, and now I love Japan but could do without him.  It was definitely one of those nights I will remember for years to come!
