urlLink How Alexander Graham Bell helped kill the President   Tells how Garfield died from poor medical care and explores the role Alexander Graham Bell's crude metal detector played in the President's death.   From the site:  James A. Garfield, the 20th President of the United States may have been shot by a would-be assassin, but he was actually killed by his great team of doctors.    Don't try to figure out what Garfield did as President that was so memorable - there was very little. In fact, most Americans barely recognize his name.    After all, he was not Washington, Lincoln, or Kennedy.    But then, he never had a chance to prove himself.    Garfield was only in office for two-hundred days when he fell into the hands of his killers - the medical profession.    Oh, I forgot to mention - he was shot prior to this - but this had little to do with his death.    Huh?
