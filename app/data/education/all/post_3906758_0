Sometimes I think about it and I ask myself many questions about college. Questions like how I will get to pay for a college, or how college will be. But the most important question for me right now is Will College really make me successful? This question is very important for me because I don't know if college will really make me successful. I ask myself this because if it really doesn't make me successful, then what’s the point of going to college. That’s why I needed to make some research to see if college will be success for me in life. A good website that I went to was   urlLink www.successincollege.com .                             During the research I found out that college is a very important goal in life. The reason of going to college is to get a career and to become someone in life. It is a time in life when you can accomplish things you will never be able to do later on. Dreams and goals that you want to accomplish will be done by going to college. Success in college depends upon academic values and characteristics. Going to college is like nothing students have never experienced in their academic lives. The goal of college success is to offer programs, books and to ensure students that they can really succeed in life by going to college.          I know that college will make me successful in life. And by doing this, I have to help myself too. Not only will the teachers help me. As time goes by I will have to make my own decisions .I will have to realize the I’m not a little girl any more and that my parents aren’t always going to be their for me. That’s why there are many things to think about as I keep growing up. Things like getting a part time job and choosing the kind of career I want. It’s going to be hard doing all this but I'm going to be able to over take it. Sometimes I'll get the help of my family but sometimes I won’t. Theirs just stuff that the family won’t be able to help you. In this BLAST program I have learned many things about college. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to college. But this program made me realize that College is very important and that it will help you become successful in life. College is the key to success; it will make life easier for you. During the BLAST program we did many fun activities. In writing class we got to take pictures and also got to write about them. In poetry class we were able to do a lot of poems about our lives and about the city. One of my favorite poems that I wrote was: So much depends upon a person having the ability to success, by using the tip of their head, while others instead wanting the street and looking as thief’s. This poem is talking about success. It means that some people just concentrate in succeeding in life while others just want the money to come to them. Doing this is not a good thing. Every single person in this world should do something and become somebody in life. In math class we worked in groups to solve math problems. In science we learned about the periodic table and also we did different kinds of experiments. In Spanish class we played the loteria game and also we had to draw some pictures on the board and others had to guess what the picture was. In computers we got to do our own e-mail address and we got to write about our advantages and disadvantages. We also got to write about our personal statement. This means that we had to act like we were going to graduate from high school and we had to write a letter saying that we really want to go to college. In advisory we were able to play games and also got to know new ones. Advisory was kind of fun for me. I think this BLAST program was a good activity for me during the summer. I really don’t regret for coming here. It was a great experience meeting new people and making new friends. I think this program helped me think about college and about what kind of career I should choose. All the teachers and tutors were great. They really helped a lot. I would really love to come back here next year. Now I know that college is the key to success and by that you will accomplish your dreams and goals.
