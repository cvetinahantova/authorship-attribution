Yet today I couldn't bare to hold back my smile. There;s always someone in school who'd just upon sight, would make ya smile. I guess its human nature to keep a smile for at least a moment of the day. Its not that ya wanna show it, it just...appears. Lol weird how I put it in that sense. But still I do know that even the most crooked person would have a pleasant thought in his mind that'd make him smile, even without reasoning. Hmm... no wonder the saming goes, "friends brighten ups ones day." Its just goes to say who really can be a friend and who can't. Thank god all my friends are true friends, be it even just a schoolmate who I barely meet.    Well today I went to court with my family to settle my brother's court case. Finally it was the last hearing. He is put under probation. Lucky him, or rather that was something expected. But even the best in language makes mistakes in grammar. Man we had to wait so long just for them to amend their mistakes. Ours took like only 5 minutes.Lol. Well I got home and rushed back to school. I thought though I missed the whole day of lesson, doesn't mean I should miss the extra classes, and I live near the school anyway. So yeah, now I am home, gonna start to prepare for my English O level Oral which is tomorrow. Its thrilling to be the first in line! Lol. Well anyway peace out all my friends! Do help me to boost my confidence in getting tomorrow's O level chinese result back though! Thanks!
