hello all,  well the job seems to be going o.k. so far.  it's an all girls school run by thai nuns.  kinda crazy.  so far everyone has been extremely nice and helpful but i haven't had to do any real work yet.  the hired me on as an extra teacher so the class size could be reduced from 30 to 15.  gotta go.  jane
