Buongiorno a tutti!          Today is my last day at work. I am so excited b/c on Sunday night when everyone is going to bed early and dreading yet another monotonous work week...I WILL NOT be doing the same!!!! I will be working harder of course in the next two weeks to come then most people do at work, but I will be working for the good of Italy.           Just for Pete's sake...I may stay up really, really late on Sunday night...just because I can. I have had a job since I was...hum...12 years old. Most of the time I have had two jobs and there was a dark time in my life that I had to pick up a 3rd job. But starting Sunday....no today at 5:01 pm...I will be working NO jobs!!!!!! What freedom! What excitement! Sad to say, but I may be more excited...no...equally excited about not working as I am about going to Italia!!!!      Ciao a tutti!
