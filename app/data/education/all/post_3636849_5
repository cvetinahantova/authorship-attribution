Blammo......on the eighth day, I created this blog.  actually, the phrase "eighth day" makes me think of Shakira.  She has a song...."octava dia"....roughly translated into "eighth day".  The whole song is a love letter to somebody, saying that God created you (for me) on the eighth day.  well put.  I'm as curious to see how many people view this blog as I am relieved to write it.  Somedays, i'll run out of RAM; others, I won't.  Eppur si muove.  Several historians have documented this phrase as belonging to Galileo.  He was arrested and put on trial for blasphemy; he issued papers declaring that earth revolves around the sun, and not the latter around the former.  I repented his "sin" agianst God and the church, and was sentenced to permanent house arrest.  Curiously, he uttered "Eppur si muove" as he was removed from the hall.  The phrase is in an old form of latin, and translated to read "but yet it does move."  Galileo was a scholar.  He is revered even today; his name is spoken in hushed tones, like those of Newton, Plato, Washington, etc.  Galileo was human; my favorite detail about him is that he lied to save his own hide.    Garth....that was a haiku.  c-
