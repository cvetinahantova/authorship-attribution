My braces are completely off, but now I have these retainers in that are just like invisalign only they are only temporary to keep my teeth in place until I actually get invisalign. There was still cement on my teeth though, so they had to do that today too (that was one of the reasons I didn't want braces in the first place, LoL). The retainer kind of hurst, but at least it is removable. When I had my pallet expander in, I couldn't pronounce the letter 'K' in a word. Now I have trouble with the letter 'S' since I have the little plastic retainer over both sets of teeth. Darn it!  The purpleness has gone! Whoot!   Other than that, nothing has really happened.  But I did turn in all of my homework today, and I'm getting A's in all my classes but Algebra. Well, actually, I'm not sure what I really have in Algebra so I have to wait until I get my progress report. I know its not less than a B though, so I'm happy with that. I'm doing well in school, is my point, anyway.  I finished Chapter Nine tonight, and thus finished BOOK ONE! FINALLY! On to book two when I fell motivated. Yawn.
