someone passed away today...  katrina villaroman was reported dead early this morning. i don't know her personally but i see her around. even if i'm not her friend, i feel kinda sad for her death. first, she was a batchmate of ours. second, she was a good person[according to many]. lastly, it was a shame she didn't even make it to the graduation. it's kinda creepy how the things happening in school are giving way to this event. i first "vibed" it when jonela brought her rosary by mere coincidence. turns out we were going to pray the rosary that day. then an article in the magazine which was to fill one page got lost. it kinda made way for out tribute to katrina. maybe it was...meant to be.  it makes you realize how short life is when someone almost close to you passes away. i heard from mara it was a hit and run case for katrina. i wonder if anyone would stop for me if they hit me. i realized that i really do have to be careful because i could die anytime. but, hey, it was [please katrina don't haunt me for this] kinda her and her friends fault. according to the story they were sneaking out with another excuse so they could get their parents' permission. and they only had their driver's supervision. makes you think, everyone's responsible for their time.  man, i almost asked daryl what she would think if i died. i didn't ask anymore because[many says] when i say it, it might actually happen.  i wonder what hell is like? i'll probably go there anyway. maybe it's like our living world. they say hell is chaotic. i think our world would be much more chatic than hell so if that's the case, yeah, i'd rather be in hell..  bahala na!
