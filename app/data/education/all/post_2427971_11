Fell asleep on the bus 'til zak, alex and alex told me to join 'em... great people my friends are, couldnt have any better than everyone i hang out with... Got my paycheck today. VERY NICE!! 85 bucks for 2! count 'em 2 days! thats for working my ass off, getting sand dust in my eyes and lungs... facemasks just dont work, rather be able to see than to breath better 'cause when you breath it all goes up into your eyes...
