Look Kevin I'm really tired of your egotistical remarks on here.  Ok you founded the place yes it's a good site, yes it's a good place to be, thanks for always reminding us.  But when you say stuff about "So why am I STUCK with ppl...", yeah well I'm gonna say something.  Your mission statement at the beginning..."anything and everything will be said"? well actually it should be "anything and everything will be said, as long as Kevin's ok with it.  What about "Arguments are fine until they become unruly"?  It's a simple argument.  Kev people are gonna complain about stuff no matter what.  It's just gonna happen, but come on man.  You can't tell ppl what to say and what not to say - that sorta defeats the whole purpose doesn't it?  This is the 193rd post...n you're gonna tell me that two comments bring down the whole site?  Gimme a break.  If ppl wanna complain, then hey I guess they can.  I've NEVER complained about the site.  Did I say that if ppl are gonna complain they should do something about it?  Yes, but I didn't actually say you know this place sucks.  It's a good place.  And I think that it's good if ppl can say whatever they want.  If it's extremely derogatory, then yeah it's bad, but thus far I don't see anything that's too bad.
