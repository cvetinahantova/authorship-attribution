. Addison's Birthday .   urlLink     this morning jaelyn, lynn & i surrounded addison's bed and woke him up singing happy birthday.    we got through the whole song twice -- inches from his face -- and he was still laying there, hands folded neatly behind his head theoretically sound asleep.    at the end of chorus two, lynn said, "who's going to open one of his presents first thing this morning?"  no twitching or changing in the sleeping face, but his hand quickly thumped his own chest.  Birthday song?  ho-hum. Birthday presents? Well that's a whole different proposition.  the picture above is from LAST year's celebration -- the waalkes kids, jae, & leah surround the birthday hero.  below is a more recent photo (in action this summer).  though most birthday celebrations will be postponed til next week (because of jaelyn's severe strep -- and probable infectiousness of all of us), we're still celebrating Add's entry into our world!  He's a crazy, funny, smart guy, and we're the lucky ones...   urlLink     peace~
