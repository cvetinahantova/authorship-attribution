so i finally started the next book on my list -- completely hilarious, an easy read and i highly recommend it to any of you --  candide  by voltaire... i've read about half of it, and that in just a little over an hour... not bad at all =P  the premise is if you think we live in the best of all possible worlds and in the end all works out for the best to take place you're sadly mistaken... candide is this rather naive innocent character who thinks the world is a perfect place, or at least the best possible... then he gets kicked out of his house, drafted into the army, beaten within an inch of his life several times, etc., etc., etc... encounters many people with similar plights, and yet now halfway through the tale, bursts out with comments like "i am the best man in the world, and yet i have already killed three men; and of these three, two were priests!"  basically lots of sarcasm at its finest...   goals of the day tomorrow? (1) wake up in time for lie groups (2) actually pay attention in lie groups (3) write up algebra (4) read the second half of  candide   the end =P
