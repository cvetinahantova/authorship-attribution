That is what the band Emerson Drive (they're country if you aren't familiar with them) is considered according to the tax forms we received as part of their contract with UMR for the fall concert. Okay, that's fine.  Here's the problem--the way the UM System pays people who are non-resident aliens is much different since they still have to pay taxes, but aren't really citizens.  Emerson Drive doesn't want to pay taxes. Thus, our options right now are this:  1. Every band member fills out a bunch of paperwork and gives us a bunch of documentation regarding their legal citizenship status, and then the University figures out tax payment from there. Effectively: lots of legal paperwork to end up not paying taxes since they aren't residents.  2. We, the Student Union Board, mark up the amount we are paying them to cover their taxes. Effectively: SUB pays an extra 30% on their contracted amount, which is a lot, to pay their taxes for them.  Here's the hitch. The group doesn't want to do the paperwork mumbo jumbo because they said they never had to do it before. The students don't want to pay another 30% for the show that they have already contracted in for. Which leads us to the last option.  The band pays their taxes and then files their income taxes in April and gets it all back.  Why do I tell you all this? Because I am in charge of figuring out what the solution is going to be.  Ugh!  But non-resident alien is fun to say.....
