It's been a few days since writing my last blog (about 4, I believe).  I need to fix my lack of updates, and hopefully this "promise" to the many people who do not read my blog anyways will force me to adhere to it.  Anyways, my last post focused on the fact that I didn't get the job that I applied for, and mostly how I was disappointed with not being notified about this decision.  Anyways, in the days that transpired since writing that piece, I have come to realize that I am a full-fledged I-D-I-O-T.  Why?  I checked my cell phone voice mail this past Friday for the first time in a week, and what did I find?  I freaking 4 minute message that couldn't have been more professional from the assistant principal whom interviewed me.  Now I have NO idea how my cell phone came into his possession, but I felt approximately "this big" (makes half inch gap with finger and thumb).    Whether it was my never-ending persuit of quality or just my sense of guilt, I sent a thank-you letter that same day to the assistant principal, wishing him the best of luck for the upcoming school year.   This cell phone thing really perplexes me though.  I'll write more about this tomorrow.
