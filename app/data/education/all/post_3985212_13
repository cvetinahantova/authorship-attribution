Tomorrow my good friend from Michigan, Kristy, is coming to visit me. She was in Chicago this weekend and drove seperate from her friends so that she could stop by on her way home! Yippee! It's been so long since I got to hang out with her. She was at my wedding, but I didn't get to spend much time with her. Can't wait to see her!  I have to be at church early again tomorrow. I thought I was supposed to get at least one sunday per month off of the music schedule. Not so much. Ah, well. No biggie. I enjoy playing, singing, doing whatever they have me doing. The problem is, I'm supposed to be in the nursery tomorrow night as well as at the piano for worship. Hmm....if only I could split myself in half. That would be nice. My mom said she'll switch schedules with me for the nursery though. Thanks mom!!!  I just got done using a whole Mr. Clean Eraser on my kitchen floor. Wow! I've used them before, but never thought about doing my whole floor with it! My floor is old in the kitchen (and getting redone soon!) so it is very badly stained but it looks 100% better now. Woo hoo!!!!  Well, I'm tired, so I guess I'll head to bed.  Current mood...kinda spacey......just out there, man.
