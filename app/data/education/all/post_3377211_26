urlLink    Now for the latest installment of "Album of the Moment". On deck this week is one of my favorite albums of the last few months. The bad news is that it took me forever to find this band for myself. I don't watch MTV anymore (what's the point?). I don't really pay attention to music publications of any kind. The only way that I get to discover new music is when I buy songs for 99 cents on iTunes. About a month or two ago, I saw something about the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and checked out two songs: Maps and Y Control. These two songs are not only awesome as far as the voice of Karen O and the perfect fusion of guitars and drums, but they're the best songs on the album. Apparently, this band has been around for at least a few years and has a rather large following. I'm just counting my blessings for finding them when I did.  urlLink      Aside from having a huge following, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have been compared to an unquestionably more popular band known as  The White Stripes  (another band that I seriously love since I "discovered" them last summer).  I could see the legitimacy in comparing the two bands in the sense that they're both garage rock and both YYY and the White Stripes have exceptionally talented singers.  Anyways, let me break down some of the tracks for you:     Tracks worth listening to:  Rich, Date With the Night, Tick, Black Tongue, Pin, Cold Night, Maps, Y Control, and Modern Romance.    All of these are excellent at demonstrating how Karen O has a voice like Chrissy Hynde (a la Pretenders).  I think these comparisons are as legit as they come, but I'm hoping for a longer album next time.  37 minutes doesn't really show me everything that this band can do  (or does it???) .   The only track that I don't like is "Man".  I feel like I've heard songs just like it many times before.  It didn't really impress me.    Oh well, that's what I'm into for the time being.
