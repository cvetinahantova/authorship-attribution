I am going to start exercising more.  My doctor has been trying to get me to do this regularly for awhile.  My wife has bugged me about it too.  Now that school is out, I'm going to attempt it.  I want to start walking 1 or 2 miles a day at least 4 times each week.  I also want to start lifting some light weights at least a couple of times each week.  I hope this blog will keep me at it by updating my progress.  Cross you fingers.
