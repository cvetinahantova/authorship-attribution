well no substitute teaching today.  i had the first graders three times however.  they are wild.  vicky and i are attempting to teach them how to sew.  it's a nightmare.  thirty kids running around with needles!  why the school made this part of the curriculum is beyond me.  anyway... other than that i had a great day.  some of the teachers and i met up for a game of b-ball after classes.  it was great.  i love being on the court again.  the girls love playing with the teachers too.  i'm looking forward to friday when i'll be moving into my own room.  however vicky and i are considering some other options that might save us more money.  i just don't want to commute ever again.  well gotta go. i'm off to the gym.  jane
