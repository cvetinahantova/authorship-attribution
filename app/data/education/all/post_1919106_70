Bite the news bullet   We got new shinies at work. Our workstation came in, so I set it up (Evan had to leave for class). All the old slave nodes on the cluster have been turned off, and we're running more of the new machines instead. They still need to have mpi set up properly, but now at least they balance the load much better. We had problems with one machine appearing and disappearing though... We think it's because we've reached the limit of the power grid in the room.  Since Evan is going to be using the new workstation most of the time I get the "old" Athlon machine. I'm installing BeOS on it at this very moment. The only difficulty for me is remembering which keyboard goes with which mouse with which machine. Once the Athlon machine is finished installing BeOS I'll have to migrate all the stuff over from the old Celeron. The room is really loud with 4 servers running... Those beasts scream like banshees. We had to resort to building a fort with old boxes around it to dampen the noise... It helps a bit, but not much.  Did I mention that we got flatpanel monitors now? One for the workstation, one for my machine. And we're planning on getting laptops for mobile platforms. We've been looking at brands, and the Toshiba and Fujitsu ones look best (the ultraportables). We don't mind them being slower as long as they're not too slow to run most of the games at low detail.  When I installed the new workstation I cleaned up the cabling layout for both disks. The desks are *much* less cluttered now.  We got all this stuff, but  the gigabit switch still hasn't arrived . Damn bastards.
