Impeccable Joneses    Soon, a friend will be joining me here on Impeccable Jones.  Because he lives his life wishing it were someone else's, I will do him the favor of not using his name- yet.  He may opt for an alterego.  Anyway, to give you some sense of what he might be like, yesterday he sent me  urlLink this .
