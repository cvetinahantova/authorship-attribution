I was recently sitting at my computer, bored stiff, trying to think of something to do.  I was listening to an internet radio station when a song came on that quite literally dragged me back into the past.  You know how sometimes when you're sad there is a song that you listen to, one that you can feel in your bones and it feels like the words were meant just for you.  Well that song played on the station for me.  The song is called Solitude, and I can remember listening to it when I was going through my split with the ex. I thought it would be fun write the lyrics here, because the song affected me quite a bit, so here it is.  Solitude - Black Sabbath - Master of Reality  My name it means nothing My fortune less My future is shrouded in the dark wilderness Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on Everything I possessed - now they are gone  O where can I go to and what can I do? Nothing can please me onlyy thoughts are of you You just laughed when I begged you to stay I've not stopped crying since you went away  The world is a lonely place - you're on your own Guess I will go home - sit down and moan Crying and thinking is all that I do Memories I have remind me of you  And I'll leave it at that for today.   Sometimes the hardest of memories come back at the best of times and create memories of their own.
