Just spent most of the morning creeping round my flat with a fly swat, really gotta take the rubbish out more regularly in future.   Got a message from JW, seems she has met someone at the summer school she is working at that she wants to set me up with for a date. Naturally the very idea of a 'date' in any form fills me with dread. I can't really envisage anything other than a disastrous outcome. I don't know what JW is thinking, her image of me is perhaps a little clouded and she is projecting qualities onto me for the sake of her little scheme. 2 plus 2 does not equal 5 however, and I don't know what the poor woman in question would end up thinking of JW for having set her up with quite such a freak as me. All this rather messes with my head since this year I have really sort of come out as a confirmed celibate, at least in my Mongolian social context. If the girl really is nice couldn't I just meet her socially rather than go through the ghastly ritualistic practice of dating which I have no experience of and am totally intimidated by? Since I consider romantic relationships impossible for me I'd be far happier just aiming for friendship, its a much safer place to start.  Anyway I can't afford to wine and dine on my third world salary.  Consulted EJSW in Argentina on this. She says I should 'bite the bullet'. I guess I should have expected that. Also says I'm not such an odd bloke really. I can't agree I fear. She doesn't know my interior monologues. As ever EJSW is all surface and froth, I don't think she really understands me at all. But in case she ever reads this let me add the proviso that I place the highest value on even the most trite counsel from her.
