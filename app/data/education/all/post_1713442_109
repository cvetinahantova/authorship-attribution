urlLink Using Critical Thinking To Conduct Effective Searches of Online Resources  Many of us teach our students to evaluate Web pages.  This site is a paper that uses critical thinking (including metacognition, hypothesis testing, and argumentation) as a tool for Internet evaluation.  First paragraph:  "More than 80 percent of academic, public and school libraries offer some form of Internet access (American Library Association, 2000); thousands of full-text electronic journals and serials are available online. However, most searches of these materials are cursory and ineffective(Hertzberg & Rudner, 1999). This Digest complements guidelines addressing the mechanics of online searching by considering how treating information searches as exercises in critical thinking can improve our use of online resources. It addresses the use and application of metacognition, hypothesis testing, and argumentation."  Full article at  urlLink http://www.michaellorenzen.com/eric/critical-thinking.html .
