You know what...it's ok to have beliefs on what your daughter or son can or can't do.  It's not ok to force them to do stuff when you don't even have custody over them.  I wanna know...Did this girl have a problem saying the pledge or was it all the Atheist dad's problem?  I'd venture to say it was him.    Adding on, I never agreed with this.  And I know the rest of The Local Cafe will go along with what I say.  If we're keeping the Founding Fathers on money, then we have to keep the Pledge of Allegiance.  It's a historical piece that would be missed if it wasn't used in schools.  Hey, if you can't say "under God" cause of your religion, then don't.  I haven't been or heard of any place that forced kids to say it.  Except I do think that all kids should know it word for word along with Star Spangled Banner and even America the Beautiful.    Well, it reached Washington D.C. and if you're denied there, you have nowhere else to go.  It's over. No matter what we can say "under God" in school.
