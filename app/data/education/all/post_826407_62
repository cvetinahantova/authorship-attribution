This was a beautiful week, misty mornings, crisp evenings, bright sun and chills.  I love the beginning of Autumn, it's so abundant, as though everything is putting on one last show before winter.                                          A very lazy weekend, H. and I haven't really been out at all.  There are times when I just need that, get all peopled out and need to just chill.  I guess its one of them.  Saw the archbishop on Conversations with Rowan Williams yesterday evening and thought he was excellent.  How refreshing to have a high level Christian engaged in humble and honest debate with the thinkers of the day about issues that people actually care about.  I found myself thinking Jesus might do the same, now and again.
