Would you all like to know how incredibly tiring and ridiculous band camp is?  I want to go there and not complain and have an okay time, but it happens.  They come up with crap like "by the numbers".  Yes let me explain: You know how you have a tempo?  You know how you have a rhythm to marching steps?  Well, for some reason they decided to break unbelievably easy moves down into parts.  A left haste that can be done in 1 second becomes a 1 minute move.  Each time you hear the number you do the part of the move, and they hold you on that part until everything is just right.  And everyone laughs their ass off cause this is ridiculous.  Not to mention, the munchkins from Wizard of Oz have become are drum majors (no offense to david, sienna, or jessica jackson but you can't see them like you could see bryant).  David has one problem too that needs to be fixed or else the band is going to end up marching off without him.  He calls a halt and nobody can hear him so the entire band misses it.  Whoo! What a mess?  And Hartman yelling her ass off at trumpets.  Let's find a plus to all this:  Andy's back and on top of that, there were other ppl from the band I saw who I enjoyed seeing again.  Joe Lidecker wore a shirt that said I Love Lesbians.  Besides all the hassle and ridiculous stuff we do, band can be fun.
