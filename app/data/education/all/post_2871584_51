I've been on a major reading kick in the past week or so.  I'm always in the middle of at least two books, but in the past five days, I've read four full books.  Somehow, I've just managed to hit a really good string books from my reading list.  The most recent of these was "Lucky" by Alice Sebold, which i finished last night.  It's a personal memoir, which normally isn't my thing, but it was honestly one of the most powerful books I have read in a very long time.  When I finished it, I set it down on the table, and just sat there for close to ten minutes just letting it sink in.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.  In other news, I'm getting company next week!  Nicole is coming up for the week to visit.  We're going to go check out some NY schools while she's here.  She wants to look at graduate music programs, so we'll be doing practically a full tour of the state.  Nicole gets the distinction of being the first overnight company in my new apartment.  She's even beat out my family, although Mom and Sarah will be here for a weekend next month.  It works out well though, since tomorrow is my last day of work for the summer.    Now I'm up to today's amazing excitement.  It's time to go start some laundry, and then I'm going out to run some errands.  Fun, fun, fun.
