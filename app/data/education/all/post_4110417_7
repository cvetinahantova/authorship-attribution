I've never liked being called "Gracie".  When I was a middle-schooler, there was a Keebler TV commercial where an elf would say "Dance for a peanut butter cookie, Gracie".  The "Gracie" was an elephant, and I was a fat kid, so I endured a lot of taunting due to that ad.  It didn't help that "Grace" was such a weird name.  It always bothered me that I could never find my name on personalized merchandise, like bike license plates or pencils or jewelry.  (I still automatically buy anything that has my name on it.)  Even famous Graces seemed like lousy role models: Gracie Allen was a ditz, Grace Slick was a rock n' roll lunatic, Grace Jones was just odd, and I was too much of a tomboy to be interested in Princess Grace.  The play "Say Goodnight, Gracie", about the life of George Burns and Gracie Allen, is running in Denver right now.  Frank Gorshin, best known as "The Riddler" on the 60's TV show "Batman", is getting rave reviews in the lead role.  It isn't the kind of play I'd normally go to, but I may have to consider it now.  To quote the newspaper ad this morning:  "Calling all Gracies!  Bring your ID showing 'Grace' as your legal name and your ticket is free!"  Wow, there is a benefit to having an oddball name.  They couldn't make that offer to the "Georges", since there are way too many of them.  I'd love to find the person who thought of this promotion and thank them.  Maybe it's another Grace.
