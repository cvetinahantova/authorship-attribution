urlLink    Â  urlLink    Translation:  Scarred, tattooed or drunk people are not allowed to enter. These colorful photos were posted next to this written notice outside a public bath. If you look like either of the drawn figures, then entering such a bath house in Japan will be forbidden you. I'm not sure if such targeted depictions of members of the public is legal in the United States, but this does seem like quite a bold gesture on the part of the bath house proprietor. In any case, someone appears not to have appreciated either the gesture or the figures depicted on these two signs, since the mark of someone's shoe has been left on both.
