Where does all this stuff on my computer come from?   While only 6% of employees own up to downloading spyware, administrators estimate that 30% of the computers on their networks have been infected.  A Wired News article, urlLink   A Web of Electronic Denial  , comments on a survey conducted by Websense.  The results of the urlLink  Web@Work 2004 survey  make interesting reading.  Would you rather give up your morning coffee or your ability to use the Internet for personal reasons at work?  According to the survey 49% would rather give up their morning coffee.  But, back to the Wired article: What about all that stuff on your computer that you deny having ever put there.  My experience here at TU is acurately reflected in these quotes used in the Wired piece:  "Chances are, people with spyware on their machines have no idea what spyware is, had no idea what they were downloading, and maybe were even totally unaware they downloaded anything at all," said Vitelle.   "Spyware does come bundled in all sorts of 'free' applications. And some websites make it seem like you need to download a plug-in or program to access the site, so people who haven't much of a clue about computers and don't read the long licensing agreements that spell out exactly how the software is going to screw you and your computer truly don't realize that they downloaded spyware."
