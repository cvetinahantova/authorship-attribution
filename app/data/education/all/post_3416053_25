Here is a  urlLink link .   It's interesting that an organization that is considered one of the most liberal, and is staffed by the usual group of lefty suspects, should fall into line with the message ofthe White House.  In this column by the ombudsman of the Washington Post, Mr. Gestler points out how interesting it is.  The idea of liberal bias is ridiculous when the modern media is so beholden to people who are in power to provide all that is reported.  Reporters have very little power to find things out and are very susceptible to spin because everything is a secret and Freedom of Information Act requests are routinely ignored and delayed.  This type of thing really shows what a tempest in a teacup the Pew findings really are.  I should also point out that these are top-flight reporters who are being manipulated by the White House.  At one point the administration was bypassing print media for local TV news so they could avoid any sort of "filter" at all.  What hope does the average American have vs the slick operatives of the administration when so many are so gullible to believe in psychic hotlines and buy crap like the salad shooter.
