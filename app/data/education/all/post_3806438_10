I went to the Dave Matthews Band concert in Camden, NJ last night.  As I write this post, I'm listening to  urlLink Howard Stern  go on and on about how Dave Matthews is gay music and just the other day I was chatting with some friends who were making fun of me for a similar issue.   I really don't care.  Dave Matthews rocks the house and if you don't think so, then that's fine, but you're missing out.  So there.
