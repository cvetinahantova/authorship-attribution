When the kids and I left for our summer-long vacation I was extremely homesick for either CA or ID, I didn't care which one, just not KY.  I had been teaching at DCA and was not in the mood to think about a whole next year, so I foolishly didn't sign a contract, but left it open.  Unfortunately, when we returned I went to talk to our principal and discovered he'd filled all the positions and didn't have anything for me!  Ouch!  Just as I thought I'd be out of work, one of the teacher's had a family emergency and couldn't start the year.  I worked as a long term sub for the first nine weeks of the school year.  I really enjoyed the class.  I was sorry when the teacher came back.  They had a few other temporary things for me to do for a couple of more weeks, but then I was done.  During the couple of weeks I stayed home I had to deal with a few health problems.  Just when I started to get used to not working one of the teachers resigned and I was able to fill in.  Another teacher who was teaching PE part time was willing to split the class, so I teach 4 days a week and she does 1.  It's nice having that extra day off.  The week before Christmas we found a different house to rent.  It was a few more miles away and would have put the kids in a different school district, but we got permission to keep them in the same school they were already in.  We have liked it so much better!  It's very homey and comfortable for our family.    So, I ended last year in a very negative way, but am feeling much better about this year.  We've been involved in community theater, which I love.  The kids are doing better in school.  We love our house.  So, we will spend at least one more year here.  I've even committed to teaching fulltime next year.    I still havent even gotten into what my parents have been up to!
