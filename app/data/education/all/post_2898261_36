Listening to: Complicated - Avril Lavigne Mood: Exhausted, sick and thoughtful  Sometimes there's a day or a night where the nightmares get too much, where tears start to flow and you can't seem to stop them.  No matter how hard you try to get in control of your emotions, you draw a blank each time.  It's only when you see that you're affecting someone you love dearly that you wipe away your tears and bottle them up to be released when you're alone so that you won't hurt or stress anyone out. And then just a few hours pass, and the nightmares get worse, they're no longer like the ones before; they're more gruesome, more chilling, more disturbing, they no longer contain the same old faces or the same scenes.   Sometimes there’s a day or a night where life gets too much, where thoughts start to gush and you can’t seem to stop them.  No matter how hard you try to stop them you think more each time.  It’s only when you’re exhausted mind switches off because it can no longer take any more, do you fall into a fitful sleep and the nightmares come to haunt you…  It’s all a vicious circle.
