You know, the concept which most occupies my mind in the last few weeks has been beheading.  Gruesome thing to be thinking about.  Ever since Nick Berg's death, I have been fascinated with the concept of how individuals can do this to other human beings. The thought boggles my mind.  How do you take a screaming, kicking, pleading person, someone with a family, friends, hopes, and dreams, and saw his head off?  How do you sleep?  How do you eat?  How do you go home to your family?  I watched the Nick Berg video and some of the other videos available on the net that document cases of torture (stoning, even impaling someone on a stake), and my mind can't grasp the brutality and lack of humanity involved in such an act.  Even more distressing are the number of people who turn out to cheer on such events.  Now we have 2 more executed men - Paul Johnson, and Kim Sung-Ill, a Korean.  The families who are left to wait in agony, knowing the outcome of their loved ones' fate, knowing there will be pictures and videos released of the horrendous last moments of life, how do they cope?  How do you exist?  Whom do you blame?  There will be no trials for the families to attend, there will be no executions to watch, there will be no closure.  There will only be a casket which can't be opened.  I believe that the war in Iraq is a good thing, if any war can be said to be good.  I support our President and our troops.  I know that sometimes the greater good can be lost in the shuffle of the everyday.  Relieving Iraq of Saddam  was  a good thing; giving Iraq a democratic sytstem of government  is  a good thing.  There are a great many who disagree.  They will be proven wrong.
