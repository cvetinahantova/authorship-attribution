From the too much time on my hands department......  Today I re-activated my  urlLink Yahoo Mail  account after reading about their service upgrade providing free access to a mailbox capable of storing 100 MB of messages.  This is, of course is in response to Google whose  urlLink Gmail  software was also recently launced.  GMail, OTOH, offers 1 GB of storage.  (Little did I know my Yahoo account was deactivated because (probably) of inactivity.)    I think I'm going to do a little experiment and see how fast the spam fills up in each of the boxes which were essentially created on the same day.  (Of course the Yahoo mailbox is older but I rarely gave the address to anyone.)  This experiment will measure the quality of each services spam-prevention software and compare the messages that get through to each.  Perhaps not a very scientific study - especially since I'm publicizing it here - but maybe there will be something of interest that arises.
