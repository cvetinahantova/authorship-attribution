In the last two days, I have become very bleak. It leads me to believe that I have cyclothymia. I have been trying for ages to like this city, and I don't hate it. I don't hate Halifax... I hate being here. There are some things that I like about this city, but living here isn't one.    I NEED CULTURE FOR CHRIST SAKE!  I am just too goddamn bohemian for this city.      Ok, so I made myself smile a bit.  That was a little funny.    Anyway, I am not feeling myself. I just found out that a guy I have had a crush on for ages knows I have had a crush on him for ages, and my reaction has  not  been typical. This is a guy I have never really spoken to in my life, but he's gorgeous, and I imagine he is an amazing person (the Halo Effect). Sure, I am probably imagining it - looks  and  wonderful personality - but it's fun, goddammit! And I would never do anything about it. It just keeps me busy, goddammit! But it turns out he knows. And it turns out he's known for ages! And I like it that he knows. I am happy he knows, and that we will  still  never talk. The typical me would cringe every time I though of *Gorgeous* knowing that looking at him is something of an addiction for me because he is so beautiful, as if it is my worst possible fault or the most embarrassing thing about me. But what the fuck? I have nothing the lose... Fuck it. Fuck. It.      BA!
