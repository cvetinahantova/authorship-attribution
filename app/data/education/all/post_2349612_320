mason (friend from my budapest semester who lives in columbia, SC) just called.  i hadn't talked to him in over a month or so... he wanted directions from the NJ turnpike to a particular liquor store near campus for a friend of his who's coming up to jersey this weekend.  that super-important business taken care of, he filled me in on what he's up to and what half a dozen other people are up to, got the scoop on my life lately, told me i still need to come visit, and with as many people as i can fit in my car that he knows forced to come along, and then end of conversation.  my friends crack me up.  yay for all of you. =)
