One of the jobs I have had in my life was a bartender/bouncer/cook at a little dive in Maryville.  My favorite trick, as a bouncer, was to redirect the drunks anger towards me and then invite them outside to settle things.  I would walk them to the back door and say let's go out here and settle it and then swing the door open. They would step out and fall the 3 feet to the ground and as they scrambled to get up I would point to the Police station and say you might want to take off because as you can see they don't have far to go to come get you.  The game at  urlLink www.wagenschenke.ch   is kind of like that.  Thanks to Kim S. for sending it to me.
