How can I explain  What I feel inside  How can I tell a soul  What happen to me   So many things happening, inside me  So much to say, so little time   Want to pour out all my sadness, my grieve, my confusion  Need to escape from all my troubles   Nowâ€¦.   To be alone is all I need  To clear my thought, also my sensibility
