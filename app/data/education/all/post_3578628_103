Olympic Athletes to Be Given Free Condoms   Athletes at next month's Athens Olympics are expected to go for gold in the bedroom as well as on the field, with 130,000 free condoms being made available throughout the Games.   Condom manufacturer Durex has donated the prophylactics as well as 30,000 sachets of lubricant for the August 13-29 Olympics, "to smooth the performance of the world's elite sports people in the arena and under the covers," it said in a statement.   The condoms will be available to over 17,000 athletes and officials at the pharmacy of the athletes' Olympic village.   "The condoms will come in an individual pack, with an instruction leaflet in various languages," said a spokeswoman for Durex Greece.    "We have discussed the numbers with the organizing committee and we think they are realistic as we know from previous Olympics that athletes do come into contact during the Games."    In the Sydney 2000 Games, each competing athlete was given 51 condoms on arrival at the Olympic Village, but another 20,000 had to be shipped in when supplies began to run low.     This is funny but the best part is the fact that they will be individually packed with an instructions leaflet in various languages.  If you're an athlete who gets it on often, I want to think that you know how to use a condom.  But then again, this might be your first introduction to safe sex.  So for all Olympians who need the instructions... Maybe you should practice putting it on or else you might piss off your partner.   One thing's for sure, we definitely don't want an AIDS outbreak at the Olympics.
