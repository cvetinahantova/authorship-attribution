Today was a great day! I went to Lake Perris with my family. The weather was good and we had a good time. There was a lot of car accidents on the way to the lake and comming home. I pray God blesses those people and provides comfort and healing. Now I am trying to stay focused in doing what I have to instead of focusing on my emotions. I have to finish my portfolio and finish preparing for tomorrow's interview. I am trying to focus on God's blessings instead of complaining about the things I don't like or agree with. Keep me in prayer--I have faith that God will answer all my and your prayers. Thanks!  Tomorrow after work I am going to work. The next session of art camp starts. Also one of my cousins from Texas is comming for the week so at night I have to head over to LAX.Well I have to get back to work now.
