The funny thing is, when I told Isaac I was going to New York City, his first reaction was similar to what's been running through mine all week...you know, the old Pace Picante Sauce commericials with all the cowboys eating around the campfire, and someone introduces a new "hot" sauce, and they don't like it, so they look at the label and say "This stuff's made in New York City!!" and the whole bunch says, together, "NEW YAWRK CITY!??!?!" and go after the new guy.  His first reaction was "NEW YAWRK CITY!!" which is what I've been saying all week.   So I'm off to said non-picante place, and I'm excited, dangitall!!!  I just won't try the hot sauce.
