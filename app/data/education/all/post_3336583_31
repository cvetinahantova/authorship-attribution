27. Ahhh, I am that much closer to 30! Good thing I don't look or feel 27. I had a nice birthday. I got to see a lot of friends and Justin came up to take me to dinner. I also got some great gifts...clothes, stuff for my classroom, Barnes and Noble gift cards, scrapbooking gift cards, and a cute fleece blanket made by Mama Martha and Little Sis Caroline. Annette made a cookie cake that the group ate (all before lunch)!      Today was the last day of preplanning week. The kids come back to school on Monday. I won't start serving kids until Friday. The special education department has placement tests to give, schedules to make, and caseloads to assign Monday through Wednesday. On Thursday I get to teach the new IEP Online software to the department. It's an all day thing and I am  not  looking forward to it! I think I get paid a stipend for teaching the class...that would be nice.       I need to be working on grad school stuff but I think I am going to make journal labels for my reading classes instead. Maybe I will work on grad school stuff after making the labels...no, I think I need to write thank you cards.
