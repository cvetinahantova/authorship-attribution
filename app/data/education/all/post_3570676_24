I am anxious for the day when I have summers off and don't have to do homework.  These classes are greatly beneficial to my personal and professional development, however; the pool is calling my name and a road-trip sounds good.  I have been able to sleep late once or twice this week.  What a luxury. Actually it is 10:30 and I am still in my pj's.  Does that make me a bum? Have a great summer you guys and gals!  I wonder what my little darlings are doing this summer?    Mary
