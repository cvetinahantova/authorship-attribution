Invite trainers and facilitators on media activism, public speaking, organizing, and fundraising. The Southern Peace Research and Education Center has numerous speakers and trainers who are experts on the many impacts of militarization. Contact sprec@southernstudies.org for information on speakers and on other speakers� bureaus. � � (3) �Contact your representative to co-sponsor the Sunshine in Iraq Reconstruction Act (H.R. 1901 and S. 876): A bill to require public disclosure of noncompetitive contracting for the reconstruction of the infrastructure of Iraq, and for other purposes. See www.thomas.loc.gov �for updates on the bill. � (4) Join the efforts for accountability regarding the administration�s lies on the alleged weapons of mass destruction. Pose the questions: Who profits from their lies? See www.wedeservethetruth.org/docs/wdtt.pdf and http://www.peace-action.org/home/lies.html. �Contact your representative to support Rep Tauscher (D-CA) on H.R. 307 and Rep. Waxman (D-CA) on H.R. 2625 to support a genuine investigation into whether the Bush Administration misled the public with claims that Iraq poses a threat. Each has supported the other�s bill, although Tauscher�s is stronger in several regards � it calls for a House Select Committee rather than an independent commission, and it calls for reporting before the 2004 Presidential election. See thomas.loc.gov for details.� �Specifically, make those calls on August 27. On August 27, while members of Congress are in their home districts, United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) in collaboration with other peace groups will coordinate a massive grassroots advocacy/pressure day to urge our Senators and Representatives to support a genuine investigation into whether the Bush Administration misled the public with claims that Iraq was an imminent threat to the U.S. and its neighbors. Call your Representative or Senator to request an August 27 meeting on this topic and let UFPJ know by emailing congressaction@unitedforpeace.org. If you'd like to participate in a meeting but can't take the lead in organizing it, email UFPJ and let them know so that they can connect you with a lead group in your area.
