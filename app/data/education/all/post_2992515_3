Oh God. I  am  in rotten mood. I woke up fairly on time, but what with the vastness of the book I'm trying to study and my sister's -what do I call it?- I-have-to-rush-this-task-so-I-don't-miss-a-single-moment-of-my-allocated-time-on-the-computer mood, I'm felling pretty sour by now.  Anyway. Originally, I was supposed to begin this journal/blog about a week ago. But then my dad suspended the internet service because we were travelling and when we finally arrived here in Saudi, we discovered that Milu was trying to sell the computer for a better one, etc. and when we got the computer, I could never find the time or wake up on time to fit my schedule....yadiyadiya. Excuses, I suppose but I really never  can  get down to writing. I wonder how long I'll be able to keep  this  journal up: the last one barely lived two days. .sigh.  What I really wanted to put down here, though, are my traditional 'summer goals', just in case I forget.  So here goes:  - Memorize surahs Yasin, Rahman, Kahf (at least the first and last ten verses) - Revise the surahs I already memorized  - Learn Bengali - Learn Arabic (this one I'm not sure I can do) - Write two articles for W.C. - Write a story? - Revise Almas's book - Revise Br. Ali's book - Attempt a painting - Decorate my room (but since I'm not getting back to Canada before school starts, I wonder how that's going to happen)    I'll add more later when I remember, insha-Allah.  And now, since my half-hour for blogging is 4 minutes over, I better pop. (I'll tell you all about my little summer schedule thing in the next entry, insha-Allah. And yeah, I'm also wondering how long I'll be able to keep up this schedule.)
