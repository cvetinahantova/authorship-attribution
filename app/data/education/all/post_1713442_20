urlLink NFL.com -  Football is back tonight!  Yes.  I have so missed watching the game of games this summer.  Sure, it is the first pre-season game for both teams (Packers and Chiefs) meaning sloppy play and fourth stringers who will get cut. And I don't care for either team.  But it is football and I shall watch it.  This is why I love the fall.  The students come back to campus.  The leaves are crisp.  The air has that nice chill to it.  And the pigskins start flying everywhere.  I need to come up with a library instruction lesson that centers on football.  I do have my fantasy teams set and ready to go at Yahoo.
