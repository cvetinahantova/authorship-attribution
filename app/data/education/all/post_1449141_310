urlLink David Bacon: In Iraq, Labor Protest is a Crime : "'War Makes Privatization       Easy'           In       Iraq, Labor Protest is a Crime           By DAVID BACON                  Iraq's legal code may be in disarray. The streets       of Baghdad may be filled with thieves and hijackers who seem       to have little fear of being arrested. But US occupation authorities       seem to have no trouble identifying one crime, at least. For       the four million people out of work in Iraq, protest is against       the law."
