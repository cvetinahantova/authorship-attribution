Ok, so I am having a bad day and a really hard time adjusting to this new environment. You have probably read my posted comments on your webpages, so you have figured it out by now, I am sure. I laid down last night to go to sleep in my new big house after my mom told me that she would be going home today. I panicked. I am afraid of being here and getting lonely. You know I have a constant fear of being alone. It has followed me since I was a baby. I don't know why I have this fear. I laid there and cried and then finally broke down and got up and sat with my mom. We talked all about it, as she played with my hair and told me that it would all be ok and that soon I will feel better. She cried, too, and told me that she was scared, as well. She is so used to me going to her house everyday that it will be an adjustment for the both of us. These are just homesick feelings and they are normal. I know this, but I am still having a hard time. I need some friend love, so if you decide to come see me on the weekend, or something, I won't mind. I could use some company. I love you all.
