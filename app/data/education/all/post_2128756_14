Just when I think life cant sink any lower.... So, I'm directing Robin Hood, and the kids are great. They really are.  But I just look at them and think back to when I was in high school. And I want to scream at them... "Look! Pay attention! Don't let this go, because soon it'll be lost , and all you'll have left is your mistakes!" But I don't. I'm really kind of glad I didnt move into a new house...because it doesnt seem like I'm coping too well with living on my own.  Let's talk about Neener. She's turning out to be like, the greatest mom ever, while I just sink into Shmuckhood.She really does deserve someone as great as her, and I'm sure she'll find someone. She's such a huge person, and I feel like a mite beside her. I wish I could fix the mistakes.
