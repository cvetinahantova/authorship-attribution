Time for another blog checkin.Why aren't there spaces between sentences in the blogs I've been posting?  I'll double space, like I usually do, and when it's posted, they're gone.  Oh well, another one of life's little blog mysteries...   I'm excited about the trip this upcoming weekend with Ross.  I don't have a whole lot of prep to do, which is nice.  It'll be great to get up to the high country as well as out to the desert for a couple of days.  I really need to get over to Nevada to plan a portion of the Tahoe trip out, too.  I'll look at my calendar...  Time to jet - more blogging later when I have more zeit...
