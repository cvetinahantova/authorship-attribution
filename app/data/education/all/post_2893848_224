Live Nude Boobs   Last night, like a lot of my friends and some of you reading this, I had strange boobs in my face.  Some notes:          -Last night, reunited with my girlfriend after returning from the strip club, I answered the following question:  "Well, did  you  pay for the lap dance?"  I answered correctly (and honestly) when I said, "No."  This got me off the hook.  I can see how this makes a difference, but not as much as the difference between having boobs in my face and not having boobs in my face.  It's worth noting how lucky I am to have this girl.           -I've noticed this before, but it bears repeating:  after awhile in a strip club, there are so many exposed boobs that it becomes remarkably like a place with no exposed boobs at all.  This extends to other facets of the experience: the dancers are so flirtatious that they might as well not be flirtatious at all.   They put their boobs in your face and the experience is so devoid of genuine affection that it is more like an obligatory hug from a distant relative than it is like foreplay.           -Going to a strip club with a bunch of writers is different than going with, say, anyone else.  Everyone's taking notes, forcing dances on their friends out of affection and mild guilt, and we all feel at a remove from the experience, drunk but also self-conscious.  (Don't take this the wrong way, guys; this is how I felt, and maybe I'm unfairly assuming you felt the same way.  I didn't used to feel this way in strip clubs, so that's the basis for my assumption: being with you all.)  We choose our favorites not on the size of their boobs but by how much they seem to genuinely enjoy what their doing.  It's remarkable, in the midst of so much pretense, how clear this can be.           -If you ask one of last night's bachelors, he'll tell you that receiving a lapdance and then later overhearing the stripper in question talk about picking up her kids in the morning gives a unique perspective on all this.  Related to the above, the pretense of a strip club is so comprehensive and obvious that it paradoxically becomes encompassed by a larger honesty.  No one can fairly claim to be "duped" by any of this; all the cards are on the table.  For this reason, then, it becomes a sort of absurdist drama, everyone simultaneously playing roles (the vixen, the man as dog, etc) and being themselves (mothers, bachelors, mild-mannered writers et al).  There's something almost poignant about this, because we are all playing roles all the time at the same time as we are being ourselves.  In a strip club, at least, we do so in a controlled environment (no touching, no biting) in which the results are the same every night and more or less innocuous .  And I can see the legitimate comfort in that.  That said, everytime I wake up the day after a night spent in a strip club, I sort of decide I don't ever need to go again.
