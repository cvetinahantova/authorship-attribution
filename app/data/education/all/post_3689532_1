Well I just got done my very first flea market experience- I came home $100 richer...as they say, one person's trash is another's treasure- however I could see me getting hooked on this - you just sell stuff and make money- sure beats going to a job you hate... I think I have the entrepenurial (sp???) spirit, and just don't have the capital to start it off... this could be a big day for me.  I am going to see 911 tonight with Uncle John- no doubt he is fired up about it. I will blog my thoughts after its over. As my friend Dan said last night- this election is going to be decided by the midwesterners...and he's right...that's what it comes down to...too bad I'm not an Indiana resident so my vote would really count.  Happy Saturday Bloggers.
