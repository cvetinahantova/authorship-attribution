Listening to: The reason - Hoobastank Mood: Thoughtful    So, it's a fresh new blog, blank pages waiting to be filled with meaningful words or idle chatter...  Just like the old one, I guess.  However, there is one big difference with this one; as the title indicates; this is going to be in the hands of a very select few only.  After realizing that people I trust were commenting on the one thing I use as a drawing board of thoughts and feelings, I decided that I had to create something new and confidential.  It is irrelevant whether these comments were positive or negative, what is of importance is that they were made to people who do not know me and have no business knowing what I think or feel, and that  lies  were also expressed.   I believe that trust is something we all take for granted when we have it, but when it’s lost, we realize just how fragile it really is.   With the passing of each day, somebody disillusions me, whether it is in a noteworthy or slight way.  Is it that I give people too much credit or that people are so fickle that they change their attitudes according to their moods?  I know that it cannot be the first, because trust and confidence has never been easy for me to give, which leaves me wondering whether I can truly see people for what they are.    Anyway…  The same principles will apply to this blog: no names will be mentioned (new codes will be thought of as and when is necessary), feelings will be spilt upon these pages with no qualms or insecurities and trust will be placed in the four that will have the address.  Please do not let me down.
