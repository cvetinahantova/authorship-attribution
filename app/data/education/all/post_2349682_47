Today I had lunch with my grandma and grandpa, my grandma's sister, my dad, and my Tia. My grandparent's favorite place to eat is Souper Salad so we went there. Just to be silly I called my grandma on Tuesday to "confirm our lunch date," she couldn't stop talking about that during lunch she thinks I am so crazy. My grandma's sister likes to say, "oh my Maricela, oh my Maricela," as she hugs or kisses me. They like me a lot for some reason. Probally because there aren't to many young adults who like hanging out with grandparents. I do cuz I learn a lot about my mom that way and also my dad because I hear lots of stories. My grandma's getting a puppy next weekend I am excited because one of my favorite smells is puppy breath, my dad loves it too I know we are weird.  I saw Sammy today he was mad because he hates to do ABC order for his spelling words, but he is just the cutest guy in the world when he gets upset. I just wanted to kiss him he was so adorable but we had to work past the anger and when he finally got the hang of it he started liking spelling more. I was proud of Vanessa tonight at youth, it was her first time singing and she did a great job.  It was good to see Joel tonight, he surprised me because I thought he wasn't coming for awhile. It's going to be just like old times hanging out with Joel once he moves here. Fun! I remember when we had Joel, Paul,and a guy named Joe living with us for a little bit. Joel and Paul played the guitar so they would have late night music sessions, once they went and made up songs about each person there. So they made a song up about me, it was funny. We also would watch Jean Claude Van Damme movies, Joel could do the stunt where there are two chairs and you did the splits on the chairs like Jean Claude did in one of his movies, some type of balancing thing. I gotta to say that I like staying after youth and just talking to people, it is so much fun.
