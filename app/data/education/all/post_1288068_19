Come! Gaze in awe at my numerical genius! Truly I am the mightiest at the 7 times table! Would you like me to calculate anything for you now? Tax rebate? Monthly expenditure? Percentage of your pupils achieving grade 3 or above? *sigh*  So yeah, I'm not sure what happened, but I passed maths despite NEVER having passed ANY of the practice tests. Hooray! I now have a piece of paper verifying my numeracy skillz and plan on having it tattooed on my arse so that I never have to do another test ever ever again.  I also passed ICT which was surprisingly hard. Was so excited I almost asked to take literacy then and there since they weren't that busy, but thought I was pushing my luck enough for one day. Woo!   I met lots of people from other courses and things. Lots of them seemed really het up about the whole business  -  calm down guys! You can take it again if you fail! One girl freaked out during her mental arithmetic test and started crying. Jesus.  I am knackered. Only three days before a luxury two days off and two days bitching about the injustice of it all back at college. Do you like my 'days' counter in the sidebar? I know the ad is quite ugly, but I like that I can know the number of days left at a glance. Also, the ads are for Henry's Cat at the mo, which makes me laugh.  I am going now. I promise never to brag about numeracy ever again. x
