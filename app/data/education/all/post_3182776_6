Laziness, it's a slippery slope.   This morning I wagged GPS with the intention of handing in my essay, getting some books from the library and heading home to do job applications. Well, it's three o'clock and I've just woken up from my afternoon nap. How much work do you think I've done? That's right, bugger all. I'm such a waster. I think my brain is rebelling against twenty-odd weeks of stress. My motivation seems to be on strike and there's no work in my ethic.  I may just muster the energy for a run so at least I will be skinny and toned when I flunk out of college.   Blogging fever has taken over the world! My sister has somehow got  her boss at the European parliament  involved. My god, this thing goes right to the top! If it carries on, none of us will be able to work at all any more. We'll be too busy vicariously living out eachother's lives over the web, cackling maniacally at our own lame jokes and holding ten-way Yahoo messaging conferences to discuss developments in trackback technology. This is all Jenny McRobbie's fault. (When all else fails, blame the Scots.)   Hav is coming round tonight for fun and frolics. Am preparing gargantuous Italian feast to celebrate.
