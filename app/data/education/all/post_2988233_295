We all have met those people that never learn their lesson. No matter what consequences they face, they just don't learn.  My brother is one of those people.  Let me start by telling you he is 60 years old, with a bad heart, bad neck, bad back, emphysema, a bullet in his liver, and various other things. Not a real picture of health. But stubborn as a mule, and refuses to admit he is not a young man anymore.  Last week, he decided to mow our 84 year old father's yard. This is a lawn, that my 12 year old won't tackle with a push mower, he will only weed eat it.  Smart boy.  It is a straight up and down bank of a lawn. No flat, just incline. Steep incline. Got that pictured in your head?  Now add to the picture a riding lawn mower, with a 60 year old on it. Not a skinny little old man, a big bellied old man, riding his mower, up this incline, doing his good deed for the week, mowing his dad's lawn.  Nice son.  Now change the picture to the mower suddenly giving in to gravity and tunring upside down. Upside down, with my brother underneath. Yep, he flipped the mower. Landed right on top of his back. Remember I mentioned he already had a bad back. Well, it is worse. Try a few busted vertebrae in his lower back, near the tailbone. The doc says all he can do is take it easy and let it heal. It will probably give him trouble the rest of his life. Stinks huh.  Want to know what is really bad? He has done this before. At least twice before. On different banks mind you, but still, at 2 different times in his life, he has been on the wrong side of a riding lawn mower, and wound up with a broken back.  Personally, I would park the mower and pay a kid to do the mowing for me.  Like I said, some people never learn.
