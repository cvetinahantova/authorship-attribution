I am in a good mood I guess...............But not really......I am acctually really angry now that I think about it and I am going to vent!              I am really kinda pissed off at this lady who came to our school and pissed us all off..... I don't know what to do to get it off my mind.   This lady basicly came in here and told us that we were racist and that we were wrong and that we needed to change... ....             Thats not the whole point she was trying to make. She was saying that things sway in our favor meaning I am white. But somethings tend not sway in other people of other races favor and thats whats wrng. She could have just said that, but she went on this whole speech about how things used to be and the way things are in other places. But maybe this place isn't like other places. Maybe we are diffrent. Maybe we aren't, who the hell knows. In class for the first half of it that was all we were talking about.             I am done talking about it. I am not racist I know people who are and thats just fine for them I am not associated with them. Some of them I do hang out with and I don't hate them or dispise them for that at all i except that as their opinion and thats that. nothing more nothing less........ .........            I wish people would stop looking at the technicalities of the situation and take what she has to say as something that we can learn from and maybe even change if thats wha this generation wants to do?  I want the world to change but I don't look at it as a realistic option for us or any human in gerneral.             I am not saying that all of these people who try to change the world for the better aren't they are changing it only a minority of it changes. That is personally not enough change to see the world as a better place then before.              I am just so worked up about this I don't know what to do with myself. I think that I just want to break down and cry and I don't want to at the same time cuz I think that I would never stop crying and that would just be mean. I think that people need to be more accepting to others opinions. In class I walked out I couldn't take it and I shouldn't have to.             I swear if we have another disscusion on it in D-Block I am so going to cry and no one can stop me not even me for that matter.
