Despite my recent lack of posts, my enthusiasm for blogging hasn't waned.  It's just really difficult at the moment for me to get access to a computer for more than about thirty seconds although hopefully all that will change this weekend as I'm going back to my parents to collect a few essentials including my laptop.   The shared house I now live in (in sunny Harlesden for those of you who are interested) has broadband so once all that's set up I'll be able to share my thoughts with my little audience a bit more regularly.  Everything's tootling along nicely at the language school.  As I said before, the pay is not all that great so I'm still looking for work in FE colleges as from September.  I had an interview last week but I really didn't like the ethos of the organisation; they seem to be focused on targets and getting people back into work asap rather than treating 'clients' like people which is not what I'm into at all.   Apparently they'll be calling people for a second round of interviews this week; I haven't heard anything but I'm really not all that bothered if they don't contact me.    Arrgh: my boss is closing the building so I'll have to leave this damp mildew infested cellar they call a staff room.   As I said, once I have a computer at home, I'll be back to regular blogging, although I'm sure my lack of posts hasn't left too much of a vacancy in your rich and varied lives...
