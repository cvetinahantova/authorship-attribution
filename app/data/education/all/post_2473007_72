Here is an excerpt from a larger piece I'm working on.  Comments are more than welcome!  Dark plumes of charcoal smoke spiraled upward into the midnight sky.  A vague moon blistered and wavered above the dances of flames on the roof of the one-room cabin.  A small form stood silhouetted against the orange blaze, stood motionless, stood quietly.  Tender planks of pine hissed and popped as the rage consumed the walls until at last the roof fell in on itself, sending a shower of sparks upwards.  The boys orange face was devoid of emotion while the shadow danced and played on his features.  Like a vacuum the emptiness existed in his sunken eyes and he stared into the glowing fury, into the swirling madness, watching the thousands of faces screaming with the whistles of escaping steam.
