Thoon...  
I have some very very sad news to share. My beloved goldfish, " Thoon  (III)" - has passed away! He'd
experienced a nasstie fishie disease, and did not respond at all to the
medical treatment. Sadly to say, his final swim was the big flush!
Well, he lasted longer than the first two - #1 lasted a week, and #2
jumped out of the bowl on the first night! #3 loved his new tank - with
a lid - for the last 8 months! 
 
However - "Thoon (IV)" will grace the tank tomorrow! lol Fingers'
crossed for this one... perhaps I should use water in the tank instead
of ouzo...? 
 
Gees... at least my flowers are still alive! lol 
  Cricket...  
 
So much for sitting back and enjoying 5 days of good cricket - it's all
over in 2 1/2 days! Sheesh! At least the Aussies won.
