Bonjour! Today was tiring, just like the rest lol...  In class we had to present our region with another person from the same place, and i am the only person from even close to Ottawa, so i had to go by myself. There is nothing to say about here! lol  then, we had lunch [we opted for the more expensive poutine rather than the cheap meal of mystery food!!]... in the afternoon we had the Ralley Loufoque  (tranlastion=crazy rally).... it was a timed group scavenger hunt, and things could be anywhere on the campus... we were second :(  after that, we waited in line for an hour and a half to buy our tickets for the three optional saturday excursions.... we got in line quickly, so we had the best chance of getting a place before the spots filled up.... we are going to La Ronde (amusement park in Montreal), whale watching, and the Biodome in Montreal.  then it was supper [pasta and rice, and i had lemonade :)] and now im here. all i am going to do for the rest of the night [the first free night] is have a shower and watch Canadian Idol, because Feona knows one of the singers [Brock... the one i dont like LOL]  thats all for now... au revoir!  P.S. if youre going to leave comments, please put them with the most recent post, so i dont have to keep checking every single one. thanks!   also, i forgot to talk about the rest of yesterday!!!... the BBQ was good, but we had to play this HORRIBLE game... everyone had three clothes pins and if someone heard you speak english or say OUI or NON, they got to take one from you... it was annoying but fun, especially when you could trick les animateures LOL... i ended up with 13, but the winner had 101 [because tons of people just gave all theirs to him]... the dance was ok, although it was kind of annoying, because they played all english songs, then all spanish songs [there are lots of people from mexico] with some french mixed in
