Boring... I've seen better episodes of CSPAN.  Ya, I had an uncle who bought the whole first season of CSPAN like 2 years ago.  He's still watching it.  Says the politics are boring but the rest of it awesome.  You know what George W. Bush says about my web ring?  All our posts come from people.  Yep, he's sharp.  And so are you so keep posting.
