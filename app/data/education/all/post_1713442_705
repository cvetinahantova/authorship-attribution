urlLink The Masonic Presidents Tour   Identifies U.S. Presidents who were Masons. Includes a portrait of each, along with his signature and a record of his Masonic career.   From the site:  This is a small permanent exhibit in The Masonic Library and Museum of Pennsylvania. It consists of a photographed portrait and the (facsimile) signature of each Masonic President of the United States, and a record of his Masonic career. The material is enhanced by photographs and background information on the Great Seal of The United States and the Flag of the President of the United States. The photographs and signatures are taken from the booklet The Presidents of the United States of America which was published by the White House Historical Association in cooperation with the National Geographic Society.  Until recently, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were included in this gallery of Masonic Presidents, but since their membership cannot be established as a certainty, their inclusion here was based more on speculation than fact. Until their membership can be absolutely proven, they should not be considered "Masonic Presidents."   Lyndon B. Johnson was initiated on October 30, 1937 in Johnson City Lodge No. 561, at Johnson City, Texas, but completed only the Entered Apprentice, or first, of the three Masonic degrees. For this reason, he is not included in the gallery.
