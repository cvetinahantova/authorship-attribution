We Stand Our Ground - Keynote at the Veterans for Peace National Convention in San Francisco By William Rivers Pitt -- t r u t h o u t | Perspective Sunday 10 August 2003 http://www.truthout.org/docs_03/081003A.shtml  I must begin by saying that standing here before you is, simply, one of the greatest honors of my life. I have never served in the armed forces in any capacity. My father, however, did. He volunteered for service in Vietnam in 1969. The changes that war wrought upon him have affected, for both good and ill, every single day of my life. Vietnam did not only affect the generation that served there. It affected the children of those who served there, and the families of those who served there. That war is an American heirloom, great and terrible simultaneously, handed down from father to son and from mother to daughter, from father to daughter and from mother to son. The lessons learned there speak to us today, almost thirty years hence.    http://www.truthout.org/docs_03/081003A.shtml
