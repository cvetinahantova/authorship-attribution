I don't watch much MTV anymore, (only on Sundays for Newlyweds, Dismissed, and The Osbournes), so I was surprised the other day to see VJ Cindy Kurleto hawking a Guns N' Roses Greatest Hits collection.  I dunno, I love GNR and "November Rain" is probably my favorite music video of all time, but it just made me a little sad, not because they're old enough to have a greatest hits CD, but because fewer and fewer young people today know who they are. Remember a couple of years ago during the MTV Video Music Awards when Jimmy Fallon kept dropping GNR hints (even whistling "Patience") and nobody got it?  Today, we're more likely to witness this exchange:  "Wow, a Guns N' Roses Greatest Hits CD!"  "Guns N' Who?"  "Guns N' Roses. They were this greeaat heavy metal band from the '80s with a lunatic front man who flew around the stage during concerts and wore catsuits and bandanas. The rest of the band were just as outrageous. Some of their lyrics were profane and controversial, but their songs were really riot, man, with monster guitar solos and lots of screaming."  "Ooh. So they're like The Darkness?"
