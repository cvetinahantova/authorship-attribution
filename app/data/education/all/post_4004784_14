So, this is my last message from Lamb and Barnosky's computer system.  I feel sad, I liked this place a lot, everyone I worked with is really friendly.  I'm going to miss them.  I have about 20 more minutes to sit here and look occupied, and then I'm going to my final "de-briefing" meeting and shutting down my computer forever.  I can't believe how fast the summer went.  I had an awesome summer.  I'm glad that we all got to see each other and that Caitlin set up this blog - it's a great way to keep in touch.  Hey, now that I'm in NYC until the end of January, you guys should invite me to Massachusetts to hang out more.  It's only 4 and half hours as opposed to 6 and half from Ithaca!  Seriously, though, I miss you guys and it's always a good time.  I'm seriously thinking about coming this weekend Phil.  No worries though, if Jon and I come, we'll bring our own sleeping things.  It really depends on the weather, and on whether I get my job stuff mailed out in time.  (Yes, shockingly, I am starting another job search, but this one is for after graduation - SCARY!)  Anyway, hugs and kisses to everyone, you may see me tomorrow, you may not!
