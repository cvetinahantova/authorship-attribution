I want to be vulnerable, cleave my body, turn it inside out, expose everything to the light, let no dark corner go unexamined.  I don't want to hurt anymore...so I turn to the light.  Only there, nothing on earth, only there can I find the salve that heals.  But it is not cheap, or easy, or free, it costs patience, perseverence, dedication, devotion and commitment.  I'm willing to pay any price so that I return only to divine light and never to ignorance.  I trust entirely in the path that leads to light, but I am forever challenged by the veil of delusion.  May it one day be removed.
