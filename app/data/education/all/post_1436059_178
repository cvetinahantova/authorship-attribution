I hate being torn between two things, things that I love equally but clash with each other constantly. What I hate even more is when I am being torn between more than two things, and more like five or six things that I love but I know I can't do all of them.   I can't do track and Tae Kwon Do and music and school at the same time.  Obviously, I can't  *not*  do school. But I love running...I love being a part of a team and being important and I love being able to relax and be alone running but being on a team and working for that at the same time. I love Tae Kwon Do and the familiarity and knowing everyone and feeling like I belong and that I am good at something. I can't give up music. Simple as that.  How can I choose? I can't and I hate it.   If I do it wrong, I will lose something precious to me. And I'm starting to realize that if I do anything or choose anything, I will lose something precious no matter what I do. Well ever wanted something so badly, so desperately that it's tearing you apart inside? You no longer think straight and just frankly want to give up and die?   I can't do this anymore.
