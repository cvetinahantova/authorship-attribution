I saw  urlLink Napoleon Dynamite  the other day in the movie theater.  It's sortof a shame that no one has heard of this movie.  I thought it was hysterical.  The only reason I'd seen it was because my brother in law, who's seen every movie released since 1987, told me to go see it.  Otherwise I never would have heard of it.  The kid has an exuberance about him that is not immediately recognizable as such.  One who doesn't identify with this kid on any level would say that he has no self esteem, when actually the exact opposite is true.  Even if he doesn't have num chuck skills.
