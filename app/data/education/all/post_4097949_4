I do believe i have found the coolest little bar in Incheon.    Its called "Muse" and the owner has a literal wall of vinyl records.   Looking at it is just breathtaking.  Finally another collector in this Godforsaken town! I went there tonight and got some whiskey.  Talked to the owner baout Leonard Cohen then drummed my fingers to some Hendrix.  I asked for some coconut rum and Coca-Cola.  The peopl ewho run th eplac eare some rather nice folks.  I am amazed that a bar in Korea has chairs with the words "B.B. King" and "Neil Young" stenciled on them near the bartender.  So i finally wired money for the deposit on my trip for a holiday in Beijing.  It feels good to be go somewhere other Seoul.  i really miss China.   i long to go star-gazing again....  where's my whiskey?
