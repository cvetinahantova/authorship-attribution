Indy - Last night we hosted the Annual Oscar Bash.  It was great.  Each person brings a good item that best represents a movie.  For example, two years ago i won the event with a statue of Jesus surrounded by onion rings for the movie:  Lord of the Rings.  You get the idea.  This year, we had about 40 people with amazing ideas.  The winners of the night were:  OSCAR PRIZE - Sue and Mel  BABE PRIZE - Amy from Pirates of the Carribean TINKY WINKY PRIZE - Cheryl Tocco and JANET JACKSON PRIZE - Linda Nunn!  It was a great night all around.
