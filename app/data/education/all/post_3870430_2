This is the Important Post -  "how to make a blog".   And its not as scary as it looks.   1) go to  urlLink www.blogger.com   2) click "createyour blog now"  3) fill in the form. Remember that your username should be different from your post name, and you need to tell me your passwords. Your post name must be your REAL FIRST NAME. You can choose later whether to display your email address or not, so do enter it here.   4) choose a title and an address. For example: this blog's title is "the hub", and its address is  urlLink www.eightshub.blogspot.com .  5) choose a template. There are a lot more than there ones out there, but for the moment just choose one here. You can upgrade this later.  6) the program will now make your blog.    ps. Big congrats to Tom - his site is already up and running. Smooth work, Tom!
