I finally have an answer to that question.  So apparently, I'm in the midst of Shimada and Hamamatsu. I'm going to be in a small town called Haibara. The girl who is hosting me during my training week says that there's a large settlement of Brazilians (although I'm puzzled as to whether they would be the  urlLink Japanese-Brazilians who migrated and are now returning to Japan , or Brazilian Brazilians) but at least I now have an address I can ship things to.  I'm teetering over the luggage weight limit for one of my suitcases. I think I'll be shipping my winter coat in addition to some food in my first surface care package.
