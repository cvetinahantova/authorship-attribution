urlLink CFP - Assessment  Assessing library instruction sessions is one of the hardest things we do.  How do we know if students actually learned anything?  Have you had success?  if so, consider submitting a manuscript to  Academic Exchange Quarterly .  Submissions are due by the end of May for consideration for the Fall 2004 issue.  From the CFP:  "Our ever more probing measurement of the learning process in all its diverse forms and contexts has enabled significant advances in educational theory and practice at all levels and in all fields. Effective assessment can play a vital role in appropriately placing students, diagnosing learning problems and progress, improving and enriching teacher performance, and in achieving and maintaining academic standards. Assessment can be at the level of the individual learner, the class, the institution, or the educational system as a whole. Studies of a theoretical or empirical nature (including case studies, portfolio studies, exploratory, or experimental work) addressing the assessment of learner aptitude and preparation, motivation and learning styles, learning outcomes in achievement and satisfaction in different educational contexts are all welcome, as are studies addressing issues of measurable standards and benchmarks. To be most helpful in this academic exchange, empirical studies should be clear and explicit about their methodology so that others can replicate or advance their research."
