urlLink "In the Loop"  6/4/2004  The article on how the RNC was outsourcing it's calls to India has been removed from the Hindustan Times, fortunately it is cached on  urlLink Google   I certainly don't see why the Hindustan Times would lie, but I see every reason the RNC would lie.    The most interesting thing in this article is how the RNC big attack guns were brought out to attack this congresswoman who won a by-election.  Based on her two days in office and single vote she has suddenly become the next Hanoi Jane.  Cute.
