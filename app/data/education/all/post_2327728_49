If anyone is down with film, you need to check out  urlLink The AlFresco FilmFesto  down at the Halifax Waterfront.  Saturday was the screening for Best in Show, and it was so much funnier watching it outside with a bunch of strangers.  But cold, so if you go to any of the other films, bundle up.  Anyone who has been reading might be wondering what is up with Commenter Ken.  Nothing, so far.  I was going to forget about it, because that is my special gift.  Seeing into the future, and knowing that nothing will come of it so why bother with the intervening nightmare date, and skip right to the "no-contact" phase? But Mandy talked me out of that plan of attack.  Apparently,  she  thinks it hasn't been working lately.  But what about this:  I haven't had a single (bad) date in ages.  So there.  Let's not get sticky about the details.  So I am going to send an email and suggest coffee... I just need to put it on the record:  I think meeting someone off the internet is a really bad idea, the worst I/mandy have had in ages.  And not because of Commenter Ken - if I had met him at a party or something equally normal, he would have my number.  But this is more like a scary blind date (which I also think is a bad idea).  Wish me luck.
