In less than one month, Savannah will be on the UNOS list for her liver.  Hopefully, within 2 months she will have a new liver, and her life will be as close to normal as she will ever get.  Which is a heck of a lot closer to normal than it is now.   If you read my blog, or have read it for any length of time, then you know what a simple cold can do to her.  You know that less than 2 months ago, she was in a coma because she caught a virus from some unknown source.  The liver transplant will help her have a normal life.   Tell me, can you turn that face down?  On the left side of my page, under links, you will see a link to her page, click it, and see how you can help.   Please.
