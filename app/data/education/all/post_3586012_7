To me, being in a relationship is like growing a tree. You'll need to water it, provide it with sufficient sunlight and take really gd care of it. Hmm... Today celebrated the 3rd month anniversary of my relationship with my  dear dear . So happy wor! Actually planned to go out and enjoy with him today de... but hor... He didn't have enough sleep lor... So i decided to let him stay at home then i accompany him while he rest. I bought him a stuffed dog, made a frenship band, wrote a poem for him and even dedicated a song to him on 933 wor(though i not sure whether it would be read out or not...)Hehez... Guess what he gave me in return... A ring, necklace and a letter! Hehez... So happy to receive all those presents from him, especially the ring(though not diamond ring lah...)
