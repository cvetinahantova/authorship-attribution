it has been exactly one month since i began my journey. the art of the living sword first took me in believe or not from a hollywood movie. the character played by ken watanabe was so powerful. a great man, an excellent actor. the potrayal of the culture of the people practising the art of the living sword was very well done. that movie made me look for it.
