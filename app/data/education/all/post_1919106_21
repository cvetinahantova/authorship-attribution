Just to set things clear   I'm a bastard. A stubborn bastard, and I don't see the forest for the tree. I get easily pissed at people who criticize me, and I don't apologize enough. In retrospection I did a lot of selfish things this last week, and I'm sure I bothered at least a few of my friends. If you're reading this and feel that you're one of those, then please accept my sincere apologies. I've talked to someone else about this, and I admit that I'm a blind asshole as far as other's feelings are concerned. If I am behaving like an asshat then please tell me so straight one. I'll be likely to throw a fit, but I harbor no ill feelings and once I get time to think things over (which is usually that same night when I'm alone) I will realize what an asshat I've been. So don't be afraid to hurt my feelings... I'd get more offended if there is something wrong with me and no one tells me, because I  need  people to tell me that kind of stuff.
