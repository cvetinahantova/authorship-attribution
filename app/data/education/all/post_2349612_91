dude  twice today i've been accused of "looking like" i'm thinking something i'm not  instance 1: sitting in analysis taking notes... prof is lecturing away when he says "and (blah blah blah)... right, lara???" and i kinda nodded, continued taking notes, and a couple people sitting near me turned around to see what had made him single me out for a second... when i kinda shrugged at them, the prof noticed that too and commented "really, i saw you roll your eyes"... dude, whatever... when i'm thinking through something i know i kinda look up and roll my eyes side to side, and i was probably doing that, but i know i was paying close attention and it sounded like he misinterpreted and was accusing me of thinking something he said was awful pedantic or something... i didn't like being singled out.  instance 2: eric and me went to a "how graduate students should handle their taxes" workshop for a bit tonight... we left partway through the Q&A part, and a lady who helped organize the speaker, etc. stopped me on the way out to ask "was this a good speaker?"... when i nodded and said "yeah, he was really helpful... good information", she immediately said "no, really, i want honest feedback... what do you think?!"... like, no, i was totally making up what i had just said?  whatever dude.  so apparently i have the ability to look disinterested or annoyed or like i'm lying when i'm really not... maybe i should work on that =P  now, really, to work, the end.
