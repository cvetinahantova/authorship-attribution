I was chatting with Merrie and making arrangements to bake cookies with her tonight.  JB: "What should I bring?" M: "Well, I was thinking about baking some shortbread or sugar cookies, the kind that you have to roll out. So do you have any cookie cutters? You seem like the kind of person that would have cookie cutters!"  I do! But the last time I used them, it was a royal pain. So we're going to bake peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips instead.
