Was chatting to my friend about one of my favourite books; Girlfriend in a Coma by Douglas Coupland.  He's just got to the end and we both liked this quote:  "You'll soon be seeing us walking down your street, our backs held high, our eyes dilated with truth and power.  We might look like you, but you should know better.  We'll draw our line in the sand and force the world to cross our line.  Every cell in our body explodes with the truth.  We will be kneeling in front of the Safeway, atop out-of-date textbooks whose pages we have chewed out.  We'll be begging passers by to see the need to question and question and question and never stop questioning until the world stops spinning.  We'll be adults who smash the tired, exhausted system  We'll crawl and chew and dig our way into a radical new world.  We will change minds and soulds from stone and plastic into linen and gold-- that's what I believe.  That's what I know."  A good mission statement, a good vision, I like it.
