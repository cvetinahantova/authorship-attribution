And while I'm discussing my trip (and I will stop), the most disgusting trend I saw in both Hungary and Poland was a preponderance of Yankee hats.  I was reminded of all those skinheads I used to know who wore  urlLink Arsenal jerseys , not because they were really fans of that particular team, but because an investment in English Football was central to their self-image and they were too lazy, as a culture it seems, to bother to learn about anything but the most popular and successful team.  I imagine that Yankees hats in eastern Europe function similarly; as an easy symbol of one's interest in the poetically fecund and, of course, quintessentially American, game of baseball.  And I can forgive them this.  I'd prefer that they (think they) like the Yankees than that they not like baseball at all, and I realize that there may be questions of access here.  But really: does anyone really need further evidence of the Evil Empire?
