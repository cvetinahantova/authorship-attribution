What I learned from Midgley and Dowling's 1978 "Innovativeness: The concept and its measurement"        One can write a lot of pages explaining a really simple idea. (1) Time of adoption does not = innovativeness because the measurement is contaminated by communication effects. An otherwise innovative individual may not adopt an innovation right away because it doesn't diffuse through his network as fast as someone else's so (2) The best way to measure innovativeness in general is cross-sectionally -- looking at adoption behavior across a range of products.  "There is little doubt that the cross-sectional technique suffers from fewer problems of respondent recall than does the direct time of adoption method and may therefore be a more practical measure to employ. However, the view that it is a surrogate for time of adoption is a misconception; its value derives because it measures a more meaningful construct of innovativeness" (p. 231).  The authors advocate distinguishing between "innate innovativeness" -- a generalized cross-product innovativeness and "actualized innovativeness" -- observed, innovative behavior.  Their proposed definition of innovativeness is "innovativeness is the degree to which an individual is receptive to new ideas and makes innovation decisions independently of the communicated experience of others" (p. 236).  The most interesting part   of the paper   for our uses  may be that authors suggest that psychological traits (perhaps dogmatism, empathy, achievement motivation and intelligence) and sociological variables (social participation, social integration -- hmmm is this "life involvement"? -- cosmopolitanism, social character and "so on") may be conceptualized as predicting innovativeness in some future research.  A third method of obtaining innovativeness measures is self-designation (e.g. Kohn and Jacoby 1973) wherein respondents are asked whether they are usually the first to buy new products. The authors do not like this approach. (Honestly, it doesn't sound like as bad an idea as the authors seem to think.)  The authors have an interest in showing at some point in the future that "innate innovators and innate noninnovators have different perceptions of the world in general..." (p. 239).  We do have a cross-sectional measure of sorts -- but the focus is (I think appropriately) on the technology category rather than innovativeness in general -- it involves ownership and use of various product categories (DVD player, cell phone, MP3 player -- although zero seniors owned an MP3 player --) -- this data was appended in our survey, so I have to figure out which items to add up into a variable measuring ownership of other technologies. Midgely and Dowling might object to this approach given that ownership of many of these technologies no longer constitutes innovation (e.g. cell phones) -- I'll have to figure out exactly how to label and use this "technology ownership/innovativeness" construct.  There is no empirical information in this  JCR , nor are there any items suggested for an "innate innovativeness measure."
