So far tonight has been quiet. The meeting at school finished at 20:30 and I've been moping round like a lost sheep for the last hour. Sandra has gone to bed and if it weren't quite so early, I would go too. I don't want to be waking in the night and I don't want to be tempted to have sex. I don't enjoy it with Sandra, it is just a comfort - does that make sense? Â  Oh, its my Mom's birthday today - another reason to go to bed early - LOL, but that is a different story (we dont get on)!
