Hey guys...finally my com's back online through serving the net. Geez there were like so many crappy stuff in my com which was jamming it up. Anyway nothing much has been going on. I've just been slacking at home doing nothing and studying...well hardly of course.Lol. Oh yeah went to play pool with bro the other day and it was so so fun. Its weird everytime we play we end up doing something cool(also known as a tyco trick shot). Well the other day was weird as the orange ball that was like so close towards the far end hole, I had to hit the white ball so hard that upon collision, the orange ball bounced backwards, balanced itself by the edges of the table and came towards the other dar end at top speed! I was like..."what the.." then we burst into laughter.Lol. It was so cool still. Well then today I my day was pretty good, had some stuff to do for Parade tomorrow, and geez after so so long I've gotta get back into my NCC uniform for the very last time.. Hmm... Yipee? Lol. Well I'm off to get something, perhaps its food or whatever I can get then. Peace out ya'll.
