It's so weird. . . When you are trying to get something so bad, once you get it, it's cool for a few days, then it's gone. It's almost like . . . You like wanting it more than having it.  Like with the cable Internet we got last night. We had been  begging  my dad for months to let us get it (we've labored over inferior dial-up for longer than any person should have to). But now that we have it, it's like "o.k." It's great and all, but it just feels so weird finally having it.  I saw The Bourne Supremacy on Friday. Good movie. I read the book too, but, aside from the title, they don't share anything in common. Here are the differences between book and movie:  1. Location; Book: Bourne and Marie live in Maine, not in hiding. Majority of book takes place in the Orient. Movie: Bourne and Marie live in Goa, India, in hiding. Action takes place all over Europe.  2. Marie; Book: Marie is  kidnapped  and is rescued by Bourne. Movie: Marie is  killed  within twenty minutes.  3. Characters; Major characters in book aren't in movie, major characters in movie aren't in book.  4. Plot; Book; Marie is kidnapped, and Bourne must catch a Bourne imposter to get her back. Movie: Bourne is framed for a crime and is pursued by the CIA for arrest.  The book and movie both had their ups and downs (i.e. the book was  incredibly  dry at times, the movie didn't follow the book, etc.). Both were good, though.  Tonight we are having dinner with our aunt who came down for a few days. Yum. Steak tips.  Only. . . shudder . . . fourteen days until we have to go back to school.   Sometime we all just need to take a step back   And look at eachother. . .   And ourselves.
