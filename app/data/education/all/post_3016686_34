What is the Spanish word for lunch?  I am taking a moment on my lunch break to add a link to a page with samples of songs from the new  urlLink Bebel Gilberto CD , which was produced by Marius DeVries (who prod. Rufus Wainwright's "Want One"). I have to be in the right mood for this kind of thing, but my first comment is that "River Song" sounds pretty good. She gives descriptions of the songs  urlLink here . How very full-service, Bebel!
