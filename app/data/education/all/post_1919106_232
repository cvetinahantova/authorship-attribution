Someone pulled the fire alarm today. Again. With finals coming up, there always seems to be some loser who can't deal with the fact that he's (or she's - let's not discriminate), well, a loser. I don't know about you, but in my opinion anyone who thinks that pulling a fire alarm or calling in a bomb threat (yeah - that happened too) will save their grade deserves to fail, and should never get any job better than making hamburgers at McFatteners. Oh yeah, I shot this by the way   urlLink    It took less than a minute for these folks to get here from when the alarm had gone off.Â  urlLink
