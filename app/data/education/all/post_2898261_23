Listening to: the radio at work Mood: Down   Sometimes things just get to me all at once, days pass where things just bounce off my shoulders, but then days like today come along, where  everything  affects me: every word, every action.   I've had enough of people getting involved in my life. I've had enough of trusting who I shouldn't. And I've had enough of being strong. Today I am not strong, today I cannot find the energy to ward off all the bad vibes or the tears. I want to go home. I want to lay down and just let everything go.  The pressure has finally got to me.
