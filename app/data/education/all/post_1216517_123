MY BLOTTER IS FULL  I love police logs (aka blotters). In Seal Beach, one of my favorite cities around, I always used to pick up the newspaper to read the police log.  One time, it said something about a guy being found sleeping naked in his car covered in shrimp and fish.  I kid you not.  From then on, I was hooked.  The language they use in the logs is great: �transient,� �suspicious person(s),� and other words that you never see anywhere else. I try to picture the guys that have to write these every day.  They're hilarious.  At one time I was thinking about writing a script about a guy that is a police log writer for a small newspaper.  The guy would be an aspiring novelist, but can't get anything published so he makes up all kinds of wacky occurrences for the log.    But after reading some actual entries, I think real ones are even more hilarious than ones I would make up.  Here are some examples from the  urlLink police log at the medfield press    -Door in truck A resident of Main Street called to report that someone placed a door in the back of his truck on Saturday, Nov. 1, at 10:48 a.m. no damage.  -Stinky fire On Friday, Sept. 12, at 10:07 p.m., a residence from Adams Street reported that someone threw a bag of dog feces at the Dale Street School and set it on fire. The caller had put out the fire and clean the mess.  -A stuck skunk A caller reported that a skunk was walking with a container stuck on the head on Thursday, Sept. 11, at 8:21 p.m. at North Meadows Road. A driver reported that a skunk was on Rte. 27 near a fire hydrant was with a cup on his head, on Sunday, Sept. 14, at 1:22 p.m. The Animal Control Officer removed the cup from the animal's head. According to police, often times when skunks try to eat food remains from the bottom of cans, they wind up getting their heads stuck in the containers.  A caller from Spring Street was crying and very upset because he couldn't find his parents on Saturday, Oct. 11, at 6:55 p.m. Police kept talking to the caller while they were on their way and finally the father came on. The boy's parents were in the basement watching the game.   urlLink Here's another one   11:06 a.m., an MBTA conductor reported a suspicious person in the booth on Foster Street. When police investigated, they found a person eating lunch.  12:50 p.m., a King Street resident reported a large plastic Tonka truck was missing. Two neighbors disputed ownership of the truck. One of the people realized they had two trucks and the other had none.  11:09 a.m., a cell phone caller reported a suspicious person kneeling on the railroad tracks praying at the commuter rail station on Foster Street. Police found a person waiting for the train to Waltham. _____________________________________________________    What else is better than TPing?  This is an activity where one (overwhelmingly adolescents) sneaks onto other people�s property and utterly vandalize it.  In my career, I have also supplemented the TP with, cassette tape ribbon, Cap�t crunch, instant mashed potatoes, vegetable oil, tomatoes, tortilla chips, eggs, plastic, knifes, spoons, and (the favorite) forks. I think a well-TPed yard is a thing of beauty.  Especially on a full moon in the winter, when the snow and tissue glissen in the moonlight.  Ahh...be still, my heart. I have a real knack for "exterior decorating."  We hit one of my high school teachers with 100 rolls once.  But my favorite TP moment was in high school when me and my friend Dan Schwartz went to Tp our Youth Group leader Bob.  But, in addition to TP we made Works bombs.  I'm not going to describe how to make these devises because the CIA and the Illuminati are Patriot Act-ing my ass right now and if I say anymore I'll wake up tomorrow in Guantanamo.  But these WMA (Weapons of Minor Destruction) Dan and I made, involve an empty 20 oz bottle that makes a loud explosion as a result of a little backwood chemistry.  We TPed, then made 8 of those WMA suckers.  However, what we failed to plan for was the incredibly fast rate at which the WMA's readied themselves.  We thought we had a few minutes while the chemicals did their chemical thing but about halfway through our making of them, one exploded in Dan's face.  He started screaming, "Help me!  Help me!  I'm blind!  I went blind!"  I had to lead him by the hand through a ditch to Bob's garden hose amid random explosions occurring behind us.  Dan didn't go blind and Bob didn't wake up.  And that was the last time I played with WMA's. ____________________________________  I'll talk more about the upcoming presidential election in the future, but this can't wait.
