I'm coming to the end of my, uh, tumultuous four-year teaching adventure in Poland. Feeling some kind of wrap-up instinct, or at least some vague need to look around a bit, take some notes, and recollect before I head back to Americaland.   It's summer, I'm gratefully unemployed, my allergies are under control, the patches are working, the beer is cheap, and I've heard of a bakery that sells donuts, REAL donuts. Time to go swimming in the dour, sooty maze of beer gardens and crumbling masonry that is Krakow.   I can put the dentistry without anesthesia behind me now. Any country where you can meet brilliant Irish women in a salt mine several hundred feet underground can't be all bad.
