which reminds me of the theory that my friend Greg used to have -- that there are two types of people in the world.  People who are skinny and sad and hungry and people who are -- happy fat.  and so -- happy fat -- became a kind of entelechial state.  something to admire, to aspire toward.    hope y'all are wolfing down your paczis today -- a last celebratory moment in the season of epiphany...  peace~
