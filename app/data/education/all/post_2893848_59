The Scudder Road Circus and Literary Journal (director: P. Morris/animal trainer: T. Moody) has arrived safely in its new home in New Orleans. Apparently, it's inferno-hot here pretty much all the time, and thunderstorms approach from the south and north as well as the west.  The choice of events and activities here is a little overwhelming. Last week, for example, we could choose between a Voodoo Discussion, a Hurricane Preparedness Seminar and the Mermaid Gardens Flea Market & Polka Party. (We went to see the Finn Brothers at the House of Blues last Tuesday, and to White Linen Night, a street party organized by the art galleries in the warehouse district, on Saturday).  When the cable guy is called Claude and the mailman is called Cartier, you know you're not in Iowa City anymore.
