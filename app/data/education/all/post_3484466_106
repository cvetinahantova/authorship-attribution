And on a somewhat normal sleeping schedule. I got up at 4 this morning... yay! Yes, anyway... I had to fix my computer, because XP got written over in the process of fixing Nate's computer, and that hdd stopped responding for a little while. I think it was an ego problem... 1.59 million mb seems a bit large. Anyway, I finally got it back, and I'm back in business, here.  Now I'm web shopping... hehe...
