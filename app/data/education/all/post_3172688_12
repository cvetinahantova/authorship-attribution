Hi! You can really tell that summer is coming; I don't think I have had a day this laid-back since last summer. I'm not complaining, though, it feels good to relax a little. Although it feels good to relax, I'm so used to stressing days that during this stress-free day, I had the worst headache in my life. It was almost so bad that I didn't want to get out of bed this morning. I almost didn't, as a matter of fact. I feel better now, though, I have my music blasting and I'm about ready to go to bed. I actually can't wait till summer comes. I can't wait till I have no homework and no teachers ragging on me for reading in class or something. (Thatâ€™s a good reason why I don't like my teachers, also, is because I'm done with my work, they wont let me read... No matter how ahead I am) But I'm tired so I'm going to go. Today I ate: 1 handful of chips 2 slices of pizza 1/2-cup macaroni & cheese 1/2-cup veggies
