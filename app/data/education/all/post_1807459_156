I've pretty much been touring like a maniac these past couple of days and I don't think it'll slow up for the next 2 days or so.  I tried blogging yesterday and had pretty much finished when the power to the whole place went out.  That sucked.  Apologies to Caleb as I was talking to him online when I was abruptly cut off. So I've arrived in the city of Hue now.  Nice enough place.  I waisted not time running around the city seeing the major sites.  Yesterday I went and saw some ancient Vietnamese Ruins just outside Hoi an.  I ended up not getting any clothes made but instead bought some t-shirts for about a buck each.   I was going to take the all night bus to Hanoi tomorrow but looks like that is full.  This puts a real kink in my plan seeing as how I want to be able to meet Gyeh-son at the airport when she arrives.  So I'll head to the train station and see what they have there.  While finding a hotel and all in easy enough I do worry about here seeing as how she is Korean.  I would equate a Korean not is Korea as something like a fish out of water.   Anyway I saw several ancient tombs today as well as a fortress.  Pretty interesting stuff.   I'm killer tired and hope to sleep well tonight.  I need it.  I'm not a morning person in the least but since I've been traveling and signing up for tours and having to catch buses I find myself up at least by 7 every morning.  That is a pretty scary thought.  I don't think I have much else to say now.  Maybe I do but I'm too tired to think of it.  Ok off to the train station.
