I'm getting a lot of work done on our wedding scrap book.  I think its going to turn out pretty neat!  We are finally getting ready to order our wedding picutures.  I mean, its only been over a year since we got married, we're on the ball right?  Well, we had to wait for our tax return to come in, and then things got busy with the end of the school year.  I'm having trouble cutting down the pcitures I want.  We are going to meet with the photgrapher, and he'll give us some ideas.  Praise the Lord!  Our car repairs will be much less than we thought.  We took the car to my dad's mechanic, and his estimate was much less. and not all the work the other place siad needed to be done, really did.  Gosh, it's so hard to know who to trust!  Thank goodness for wise protective Dad's!
