..And up, and up. That's what things are doing. I did quite well in the last assignment for Algorithms, and I'm confident that I also did well in this week's one. I'm staying on track with my work, that is, not lagging behind. I have many things to look forward to throughout the day. I certainly wasn't mistaken last week when I said that I could get used to this.
