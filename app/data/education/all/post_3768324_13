Hey everybody.   ("Hey Dr. Nick!" - refrain)  You ever read blogs on the Internet and think to yourself (or, conversely, say to yourself, as I know I talk aloud), "Jesus, who cares what this dude thinks? I'd rather hear Chris Matthews discuss this!" Disgusted, you hurl your DSL cable into your Craig's List-purchased Popizon (acceptable spelling, although some prefer Papasan) Chair and turn on the TV, smiling brightly.   I'm not sure what I'm doing here. Not at all, really. But I figure it will take shape eventually. My promises, for now:  - Try not to author viewpoints on things I don't understand - Try not to post random links that take you places I wouldn't understand either - Try not to be an ass  Sh*t, guess that last one is already done for.  I know about three things in life: sports, pop culture, and using the Internet to find out random facts. I can tell you why "Igby Goes Down" is a modern-day "Catcher in the Rye," or dine with you over notions of why Grizzlies vs. Nuggets will be the Bulls vs. Knicks feud of 2010 and beyond.   I couldn't name more than 10 US Senators, although I'm mildly socially aware.   I didn't know I was liberal until I was just about 21; now I bask in the reflected glow of that narrow description daily.   I believe that if Donna Martin can graduate from HS, anything is possible.   I believe to become a well-read blog, I need a rotating hook. Let's try this: Question of the Day.    Question of the Day   Where does Kobe play next year? Where does Shaq play next year?
