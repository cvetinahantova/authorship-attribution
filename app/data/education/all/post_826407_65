Church was so very good tonight at the Teaching Service.  Everything was adventy, had an amazing time in the worship, Mike told stories and seemed to be speaking just to me and there was the black eyed peas.  Was feeling very low due to a badish week at School and God totally blew that away there.  Woo hoo!    urlLink the new St Tom's website  looks fantastic too, nice one!
