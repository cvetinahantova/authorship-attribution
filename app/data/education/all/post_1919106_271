Just an hour ago I turned in my beast of an assignment. 50+ pages of codalicious l337ness. Now I get to rest. For the afternoon. Tomorrow perhaps I'll rewrite everything in Ruby just to show those Java-loving, leaf-licking, mandolin-strumming pansies how real programs should be written. I bet you 20 bucks that I can make it in under 3 pages, source documentation included. And it'll run faster. And'll be easier to read.
