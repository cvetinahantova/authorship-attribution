I always do self contradictory things......  I had had a piece of delicious fatty blue-berry cheese cake before I worked out hard this afternoon.   I spent a lot after I have promised myself to save money.  I remembered the last literature course I have taken in  urlLink my beloved university , twentieth century fiction. We deconstruct some norms and believes before we can build up the new order. Do I have to put more fat in my tummy before I finally 're-realize' the urge to  lose weight? Do I have to wait until I receive the credit card statement before I finally 're-realize' I am nobody except a big pile of clothes, bracelets, earrings and skincare products?   A super strong belief must be presented in order to help me to skip the deconstruction step and jump to the new order building step......
