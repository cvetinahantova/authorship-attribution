There's rumors on SOSH of a ridiculous trade:  1)  Blue Jays get Cesar Izturis and ml pitcher (Jackson?) 2)  Dodgers get Nomar and Kim 3)  Red Sox get Odalis Perez and Carlos Delgado  Ridiculous.  But if it happened, it might counteract the soul-crushing extra-innings loss to the Yankees last night.   (God- what a fucking game.  I've been trying to get past this whole "yankee hatin'" thing, but I realized last night that hating the yankees, loving the red sox, you can't  really  do one without doing the other.  That said, I felt sympathy for Derek Jeter for the first time ever.  But I still hope his dog dies.)  Anyway, as for the trade, I think I'm with SOSH poster Romero Romine:   The way this season is going, they'll announce the trade pending medical exams, Delgado will pass the exam; then, during the press conference sealing the deal, the creature from Alien will leap out from Delgado's sternum, killing all Sox players save Kevin Millar and leaving the writers.
