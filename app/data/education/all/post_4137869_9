Donnie’s 1st letter to me:  Amy, Waz up, nothing here. Amy I am sorry for not being there for you & Jonathan! I’m in prison on my probation violation. I know you probably don’t want shit to do with me but I do want to be there for my son, when I get out of here, around May or July. I hope you can forgive me for not being there. My head wasn’t in the right place. I’ve been on the run for the last 8 months. I have been wanting to see my son so bad, but I was afraid. When I get out I will get a job and pay you some child support. I think this time has done me some good. I now have my head in the right place. I want to get to know Jonathan and do all the stuff fathers and sons do. Will you send me some pictures? If not, that’s okay. How much do you want a month? I was thinking $250.00. What do you think? Amy I’m so sorry! I hope we can work something out for Jonathan’s sake. He should have a mom and dad. I will sacrifice my whole life to be with my son! Now I don’t have to worry about the cops every time I turn around. I know you don’t understand what’s in my mind, but you know me better than anyone else does. I just hope you’ll let me be a part of his life! And we can get along for it. P.S. If you get this please write back please. Sincerely, Dopey (Dopey used to be my nickname for him)
