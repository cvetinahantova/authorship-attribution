kd lang's  Hymn of The 49th Parallel   is her best record since  Ingenue . It's a covers album of Canadian songwriters. When you find a singer as good as kd, you need to also find songs worthy of her voice. She does that consistently on this album ( urlLink samples here ).  kd's Joni Mitchell covers here are very faithful. On "Jericho," a song about maintaining a relationship, kd sounds as if she'd stepped into the 1970's to use Joni's arranger. This is a good choice because it has  perfect  lyrics, but not everyone knows the song because it was on Joni's obscure "Don Juan..." album. My favorite bit:    Let these walls come tumbling down now     Let them fall right on the ground     Let all these dogs go running free     The wild and the gentle dogs     Kenneled in me    The revelations for me are the lesser known songs, such as both Jane Siberry compositions, in particular "The Valley" - she nails the little vocal yodel ("you will wa-a-a-alk") of the chorus perfectly! I used to buy Jane's CDs and then...not. This makes me miss her. I knew both of the Siberry songs on this record, but both seem better to me when kd does them. It's true that kd emphasizes the pop in folk/pop, but on Jane's record "The Valley" is a bit meandering and her it is concise. The hook is elegant because it's used so sparingly in both versions. "Love Is Everything" is just a  majestic  breakup song - I don't quite like the way kd changes the words in the bridge (see lyric booklet and compare), but her voice was made to belt this song.  My favorites on this record remain the Neil Young songs. If I was kd's agent, I would get her into the studio to record one each week.  A very moving album - should be in my top ten of the year.
