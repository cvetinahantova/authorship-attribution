Whether we call it intuition, where the analysis is done subconsciously, or data mining, which is the opposite end of the scale, we need data available in the relevant format. With intuition, the data is absorbed continuously, over a period of time, and the brain filters and arranges based on experience, which is why no two business people will present you with the 'same' understanding, unless they got it from a book, where you could look as well. With DM we sometimes even need to know what we are looking for, and the data we need to look in, before we start the searching. Why? Because we are trying to confirm something to aid our understanding of the situation represented in the sample data being used.     Since we can't be all things to all people, thank goodness that there are people who are prepared to fill in the gaps for us.     With this in mind I will sometimes place links here to areas where I have found valuable data in the past, and where I think others may also be able to derive benefit!     Here we go with the first of these:-     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Summary Results from The OLAP Survey 3 Sponsored by: Microstrategy ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Download "Summary Results from The OLAP Survey 3" and get insight into actual customer experiences with various BI products.
