Well I'm in school now, using the school computer lab to do some chinese work, I'm so lost in reading the question...not that I even know how to type in chinese.Lol I'm using this chinese translator thingy to get my language right. Anyway its like 10 more minutes before this lesson ends and I'm I've learnt nothing new at all since this morning. Guess its just gonna be another long...long...boring day. Well at least for now I can think of what to have for recess... "hungry hungry little old me".Lol. =S
