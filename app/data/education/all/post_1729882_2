I was reading the paper this morning when I came across a letter to the editor.  The basis of the letter was that anyone who is opposed to the war in Iraq or even the atrocities at the prison should get out of America.  "America, love it or leave it," sound familiar?  It should if you know anything about the war in Vietnam.  It went on to resurrect the ghosts of 9/11.  "They" caused the horror of the WTC and at the Pentagon and "they" can only get what they deserve.  I heard similar arguments when the story of Mi Lai (spelling?) came out.  Nobody can tell me that history doesn't repeat itself.  Iraq is this generations Vietnam.  We shouldn't be there, and we have no way of winning.  I don't want to see another wall with a list of the names of the dead who died for no reason.  Don't get me wrong, one thing is going to be different about this war.  There won't be any "blame" forced upon the soldiers who are doing their duty.  However, wrong I see this war, these soldiers were given orders to carry out and have done so admirably, despite a few rotten apples.  You can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake. --Jeannette Rankin
