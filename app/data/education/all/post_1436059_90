Okay, yesterday really, truly sucked, so I won't think or talk about it anymore because what's done is done and the past shall remain the past. Anyway, tomorrow is the first day of finals. I have English and Keyboarding. Both should be pretty easy, I hope. Then on Saturday me and Amanda are going to study together for Government, Algebra, and Spanish.  ARGH! About Algebra....MRS. M was being such a...Okay, I won't curse but...It really sucked. I retook her test on Tuesday and she said she wouldn't grade it and she wouldn't let me take her final unless I had given her a note for that day the bus didn't pick me up - - Remember, the day the office said that they would take care of it, and that it was a LEGAL ABSENCE?? I honestly can't stand Mrs. Meeer-a-bile.  I'm tired, and hungry, but I need to study. MUST STUDY...MUST STUDY...  *studies for five minutes*  *goes and plugs her guitar into her amp*  *ignores computer*  *ignores study review sheets*  *plays guitar*
