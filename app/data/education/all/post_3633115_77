I am starting to experiment with template stuff.  Very minor to start.  I added a links section to the right.  These links are very rudimentary, so don't expect much of anything.  Shorty's page used to be better, but I let it go.  I had to recreate a new one so his will take time.  As for the other one. I forgot I even had that page until just a little bit ago.  I have since been messing with that as well.  I anticipate some decent sites sometime before I turn...well, sometime before I die.  Just thought I'd share.  I hope to educate myself enough to create myself a whole new template and everything.  This will take some time though.
