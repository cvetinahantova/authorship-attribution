You know... the thing about this thing that i don't like is that everyone can read it if you post it! all they need is the link... ever feel like you wanna write something but then you only want certain peeps to read it and certain peeps you don't wanna read it.... ugh i dunno i do.. cuz sometimes you just wanna talk about something that has to do with someone but you know if they read it they will know it's them... hrm argh so confuse so confused so confused... Gosh you know what my problem is? i just think to much... I think to much into everything then i get myself all worried and what not and then i just like go crazy... not literally but like it feels like it... ya but anywayz that's all i'm gonna say before i go "crazy"
