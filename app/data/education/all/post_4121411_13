Worse still...I got complains from teachers that I took 2 days MC....can't a teacher fall sick?!?!           1 more month before Eileen goes back to US...I'm really going to miss her.Still, I praise God that He sent her back to Singapore and brought us together. Amen! Well, we had the National Day celebration for the school today. The good news is that we will have a super long weekend!from Saturday to next Tuesday! I have more time to be with Eileen...can't wait to surprise her with the stuff that I have prepared for her...haha...I'm sure she will like it...           I'm really excited for the weekend..hahahahaha
