This is awkward.  I have decided I could like this office very much.  It will certainly be a very interesting position.  Yet there remains a rather stark shadow.  I have yet to sign anything agreeing the the terms and conditions of my employment.  There is a verbal contract that I shall work until February 28, 2005 at $16.85/hr.    Last night I got a phone call from the Math and Stats office for an interview.  They wanted me to come in on Thursday.  I cannot go on Thursday, but we compromised on Friday.  She was incredibly accomodating.  I cannot find my information sheet for this job, so I do not know if it is full-time or a contract.  If it is full-time, I sincerely hope I get it.  I may not take it if it is a contract (unless they offer me a sheet of paper and more than I am making now).  I am a bit confused as to the moral implications of taking an interview after one has been offered a job.  On the one hand, they have yet to provide me with a formal, written contract.  On the other hand, I have made a verbal commitment to them and they have made a verbal commitment to me.  On the one hand, this is only a contract.  On the other hand, the intent is to make it a full-time job in February, and the implication was made that I would be hired full-time at that time.  Advice would be appreciated.
