it occurred to me that everytime i think of something i want to post on here it revolves around food; surprise!! so i:ll spare you the details of my fabulous noodle lunch and indulge in the beauties of the bathrooms instead. so i mentioned the big flush and little flush before. the big flush is so large it goes on for, literally, two minutes. also, in women:s bathrooms many of the toilets have buttons that make a flush noise without really flushing so they can mask the sound of their excretions. and they play it over and over and over again the whole time they:re in the stall. at first i thought they were just wasting gallons of water, which is very unjapanese. and many of the bathrooms have lights that illuminate automatically depending where you walk. when you open the door, the first one comes on. if you head to the sink, the ones over there light up and only the one over the stall you:re in comes on. like something out of the jetsons. most places use the asian type of squat toilet which is just an oblong basin in the ground. i:m getting better at it although you do have to take caution not to urinate on your shoes or give yourself a hernia while having a bowel movement over one, so i hear. on a somewhat related note, i:ve also been told it is part of my duty to check the handicap bathrooms at school to be sure the -bad kids- aren:t sneaking off and smoking in there. it:s comforting to know that some things do transcend cultural boundaries.
