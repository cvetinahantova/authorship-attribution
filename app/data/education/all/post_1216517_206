all day i've been checking flights to cuba, dreaming of another adventure.  wake up after noon and at 6 i realized the day had begun.  walked up to develop pictures but the one-hour was closed.  talked to trevor and read magazines.  as i passed winchell's donuts i talked to tisa about the bar-b-q, but said i was sorry because i thought we were out of hamburger patties.  trev said i should come up with some short film ideas, but lately i've been feeling pretty dry.  all my long ideas fall flat around page 8, and all my short ideas have yet to hit ther screen.  lot of others are gearing to become pseudo-famous (maybe), but i have a bit of trouble getting off the porch.
