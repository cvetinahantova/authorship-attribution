1.   Flashback   The stillness of the night, The eerie silence of dawn Bring thoughts of all things Past, done and left undone!  As my heart’s ears listen to  The music of silent serenity, And my mind’s eyes see  Things invisible and unseen…  My soul longs to go- Beyond the chilly blanket Of the dark night and To things past and gone by!    2.            I am the Phoenix    F rom down the very stretches of mine soul,  E ndless thoughts of times great and gone by  L ift themselves to where me stands dreaming.  I mpatient tears escape to spring upon mine cheeks,  C ares of vengeful vanity triumph over me,  I rrepressible, I grope to go and show to all  T he girl who’ll rise from memory’s bones and ashes,  Y esterday, she was down, and yes, that was yesterday!
