I had to close the last topic out because of the different nature of this one.  I have been a part of a yahoo group of ladies for over 4 years now.  We have all grown to love each other like sisters.    I am thinking of leaving the group.  Lately, with all my troubles, and depression stuff going on, I have been a real downer to the group.  I have noticed that my posts aren't getting replied to, except by two women.  So I think I need to say   goodbye.  I hate too, I really do, they ahve been my life line for a while now.  But, I really feel like they kind of want me to go.    A couple of years ago, we had one woman/man/who knows that was posting and they got rid of "it" because of inconsistencies in "it's " stories.  I totally understand that.  "it" had soem dooseies.  I don't want them to have to make that decision about me.  One in particular has made reference lately to another board.  I am beginning to wonder if they are all on the other board, and were too nice to invite me to join them.    I may be being paranoid, but this is how I feel.
