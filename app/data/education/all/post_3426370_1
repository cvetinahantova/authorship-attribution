Now i have a light to  go to...in this insain world. A flash light but a light none the less. I love my books...the ones I write....my light in the darkness.my writeing keeps me going I guess you could say. Escapeing to my fantasy world of a fox demon named Kaia and Shikyo also a Fox demon. Obviously Kaia is the erogant one. A strong pride and a soouless and heartless. Yet destained to beccome the greatest fox that ever lived. but shhe still must deal with her past. horried and jaged with her having killed her phycological bother ,that killed her parents, and came after her hher only choice was to kill him. but that first taste of blood fuled thhe flames. She would then slaughter billions.  But it was what happened prior that aided to her snap.  her brother abused hherr ,hit her, forced  her to fight.  Kill mortals and witness things nno chhild couold  or should. Thhis storyy is my llife....I write it every day. The relation ship grows between Kaia and Shikyo so does the sinnce of  unreality. Its all a complicated mess at the moment I guess only an excentrric onne suchh as myself could understand. Mew...who knows.  Its a mess. but then...thhe darkness. School ... there is a sickness goinng around you get a horrible cough annd you are sick for months. The whole school is frreaking out annd jaming mmeds down our throats....I hate it. its just hell...as far as i am conseredd. Then you hhave those people whho think I am 'depressed' . It annoys me to thhe brink of innsanity.  God...people...*rolls eyes and sighs* wwell annotherr day...anothher pain in the butt...
