Home from Hawaii and I'm catching up with all the chores.  I'm off to do some field recon for the Tahoe/Nevada trip.  I'll round up some road logs and see what I can come up with.  I'd like to get in some hiking for a couple of the days to get some exercise in while on the trip.    It took a day to recover from jet lag coming home.  I took the red eye back and got in to SF at 5:01 am, then had to drive 2.5 hours to get home to Cola.  I slept a lot yesterday!    I miss CJ and TK!  I also called to check on BixurBoy and he's doing fine - in good hands with Kathy and Mike.  They love him.  I bought CJ and TK some T-shirts and boxes of the best candy on the planet from the famous Hilo Candy Factory.  I remember going there while visiting MaryAnn.  It'll be good to see the girls again.
