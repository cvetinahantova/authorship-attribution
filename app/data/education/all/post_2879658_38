In three days I will have been in Japan (or Asia at least) for 10 months.  I will admit that I am really excited to be heading back to the U.S, even if only for a month, come the end of July.  This might sound a bit strange but one of the things I am most looking forward to (of course after seeing friends and family) is being just another face in the crowd.  So many people in the U.S. go through great lengths to stand out, but I am anxious just to blend in.  I am anxious to go to the grocery store and not have people watching me and to walk down a street and have noone look or think twice.  In Japan many argue that the Japanese try to ensure that the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.  Unfortunately, this doesn't extend to foreigners as it just isn't possible to implement.  So while sometimes this celebrity status foreigners often carry in Japan can be nice, the novelty wears off and you suddenly find yourself just wanting to get lost in a crowd!
