I just felt like saying, I  love  you...  I dont know who I  love ,  I feel loneli and neglected...  So I am offering jobs, if you  love   Please  love  me...   As I sit by myself,  I've come from so,  so far away.  In such little time,  I have gave,  My soul, my mind,  I've tried so hard to find.  Is this what I must do, to get by?  And I ask myself why?  Why don't you run,  why don't you call me,  I'll wait here.  I'll find my way,  or will you help me out this year?  Does she understand me?  Listen to what I say.  Turning her back, on my dreams.  Watching, waiting.  You turn your back.  I'll find my way home,  You turn your back.  Turn your back on my dream,  So strong, so weak,  we're stronger still.  Is this what I must do?   You are calm and reposed.  Let your beauty unfold.  Pale white, like the skin stretched over your bones.  Spring keeps you ever close.  You are second hand smoke.  You are so fragile and thin.  Standing trial for your sins.  Holding onto yourself the best you can.  You are the smell before rain.  You are the blood in my veins.    Fuck ...
