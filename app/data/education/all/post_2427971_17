Another day gone by, not much interesting unfortunately... Did the same stuff I usually do in school. Play games in Design Tech, then do half of my homework assignment in Math and draw the rest of the time. Oh ya! Hella fun, had a blast! Just been really tired lately, getting more sleep doesn't seem to help as much as I want. I skipped D-Block again, didn't have time to drop me off. So I messed around in Halo, caught up on Gunbound, got some gold etc... Now I have a killer headache, getting a little sensitive to lights. Just feel like going to sleep and not waking up for a few weeks. Also feeling some pressure behind my eyes, that's different. So yeah, just sitting here being tired and writing. I'd get more in if I could think straight, really would. Just missing Katherine at the moment :\... Oh well, I'll see her eventually. Just hoping it's sooner than sometime next week, if not that that's really gonna suck. Crap, ok... I'm done for now, I'll post again when/if I have more energy to think straighter. Cya.
