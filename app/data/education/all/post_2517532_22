1.  Living    M ad as mad can be, so they say,  I  breezed through this, my journey  N ot one thing ever I noticed, nay!  A las! Things I saw not, a many.   L ife is lived as lived, so they say,  Y es, I know at this time and way.  N e’er shall come the old nor the day!   2.  Love from Afar    N o love can ever be more true  A s I love all that is you!  O h, those eyes, those lips! God!  M y love, all stops with you near.  I  look at you- your face, what joy!   J oy that is incomparable to  A ny that the mortal Earth gives,  N othing breaks such feeling of magic-  E ven as I watch you from afar.   3.  Life Poem  	  H eavy rains and thunder pounded all around, 	          through and through;  “ E vil broke lose,” my child mind could but whisper 	          to the wind.   R ough roads and rocks, I went through when from safety 	          I came about;   M y strong weakness oft almost beating out what seemed 	          like weak strength.   A h, but nay! After the cats-and-dogs, the rainbow 	          came for me!
