It's the most wonderful time of the year: it's the last day of classes, we hope everyone passes, no more integrals here! It's the most wonderful time of the year!  It's the hap-happiest season of all: all those tensor constructions and homotopic notions now dash away all! It's the hap-happiest season of all!  There'll be exams for the taking, "no math" nights in the making, and sliding round out in the snow! there'll be scary test stories and tales of the glories of math quals so long, long ago.  It's the most wonderful time of the year: no more all night homeworking, round starbucks i'll be lurking now that finals are near -- It's the most wonderful time of the year!  ~new and improved lyrics courtesy of me =)
