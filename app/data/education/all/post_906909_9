Reflection:   This week has been a bit slow as I was occupied with a fair bit of stuff at work. Reading focus however has dealt with constructivism (and my still unfinished Wilson's reaction) and the ADDIE model.   The ADDIE model is not entirely new as I've used it during my short stint in instructional design. However, as indicated, the Analysis part was largely skipped and resulted in a very pedagogically unsound result. However, the infusion of multimedia and a snazzy LMS overshadowed the shortcomings.   Am committed to make inroads into understanding this model. Am also thinking about the proposal and figuring out the requirements of the course project.    Action:   Reading up on the ADDIE model, particularly analysis and am contemplating the project proposal.   Observation:  The emphasis on constructivism is still demanding understanding and relevance though light is streaming through. Being unable to decide on a project proposal I'm happy with is delaying work on the graded Discussion Activity.
