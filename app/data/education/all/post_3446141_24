Well this weekend was pretty casual, didn't really go out or anything.  Friday night some friends were grillin and such but I wasn't really in the mood to drive to NLR so I stayed home with my sickly rommie...lol.  Anyway, I found myself at the local BlockBuster lookin for a good movie.  I ended up getting Gothika and Girl with a Pearl Earring.  They were both good!  Gothika was way freakier than I thought it would be!  That was what I watched on Friday night, then after that I went to a movie at the theaters with my other roomie Alicia.  We went to see the much acclaimed movie "The Anchorman" and it was very funny!  And crowded considering it was the opening weekend, I think.  So that was Friday, didn't go to bed till like 3 tho because I ended up staying up and reading a book. LOL, I'm becoming a grandma, lol.  Then Saturday I slept till like 12:30 and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!  I love to sleep, even tho I always feel like lose some of my day, I don't care.  Then I got up cleaned, ate lunch, and got ready to go.  About the time I got outta the shower every one got home.......lol......Alicia home from work and Tyler home from wherever.  So that slowed me down, but I got out of the house around 4!  Tanned and visited the greatest store EVER!!! LOL.  Drug Emporium! OMG!  They have every kind of hair product known to man!  I mean seriously I was in heaven!!  I spent about $50.  Oh well.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  Then I just went shoppin with Alicia, RK and the Mall.  And bought my 6th pair of flip-flops this season!! Isn't that crazy!  Ok that was my boring weekend.  For all to read. It's Sunday today.  And I think I will do my nails!  Perhaps I will have something more interesting to talk about later.
