My close friends    Draw  me a picture with your  flawless  talents and don't think I am so  raw  and  thaw  on you, so i get the last  straw  for me to  gnaw  it and act like you are  law  and think of me as a cool  outlaw .   You  light  up so  bright  and burn the  midnight  oil, yet you are the  mighty  guys who love to  flight  so you could  delight  me and sometimes  fight  with me because you are always  right  and talk the  night  away - heh ah  alright .  I want to  clang  the  gong  for you, my  strong  friends, to realize that for a  long  time I yearn that it is not  wrong  of me to ask you to keep our friendship aflame like a mellow  song  for i am grateful that we get  along .   Show  me about who you are, and  how  beautiful you are, I shall  lower  my head down and  bow , oh my friends and I encourage you continue to  grow  and  know  yourself by loving yourself so dearly  slow .   Shoot for the evening  star  and  unbar  yourself out and hop in a hot  car  to go so  far  away - hey don't you  mar  yourself because I could not  bear  the  scar , so I preserve of our friendship in a  jar .   You are not very  cold , you are never that  old , you are  bold , you and i  molded  our friendship very well, you  told  me that you love yourself first, you  hold  a place in my heart and you are a  gold .   ~Kekua May 2004
