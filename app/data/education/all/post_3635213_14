The Big July fourth celebration was held on July 3rd at John and Michelle's house.  It was a great time for all.  I however was not too happy about the part when John and Patrick realized it had been too long since they last tickled and ganged up on me!  So they proceeded to do so until I yelled, "Hey that is why you have wives and babies!"  Then Lydia so cleverly asks, "Patrick who are these other wives and what babies?"  :-P  Don't you love Watts' humor, hehe.    Other highlights were the pictures of the family that were like taking wedding pictures, "Okay now the mom and dad and Reganne, okay now the grandparents, okay now the bridesmaids, oh wait!"  ;-)    Also the fact that there were FOUR Daves on the FOURTH.  Dave Watts, Dave McKinney, Dave Patrick Watts, and Dave Greene.    There was a fabulous manicurist and diaper changer, Kaye, who did a wonderful pedicure with red polish and stars.  I hope she gets started on her new invention she was thinking about making.  (o;  It was a great time for family, puns, and fun!  (o:  Today I have another little celebration with my friends: Shelly and Matt, Laura and Justin, and Dave.  We will be cooking out and swimming at Shelly and Matt's house.
