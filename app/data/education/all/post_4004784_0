hola all,    last night, i went into boston to "see" the red hot chili peppers play at one of the DNC parties. unfortunately, the stage was blocked from the street and we couldn't see anything, but we chilled on newbury street and listened to one heck of a rock show. anthony keidis and company played an awesome set even though they left out my fave ("under the bridge")! didn't really see to many celebrities. saw a couple of people who looked like they were important.     i've been on vacation this week. it's been nice having nothing to do! and i finally had time to clear some stuff up with school - i am now officially a full-time student! :-) and i just got my registration information from the school of public health. i have to choose whether i want to take epidemiology or essentials of public health law - fun stuff! :-)    poor donna! hope your day got a lot better after that incident! at least no one (especially you) was hurt! oh, and i have been to newport, but only for work. it's a beautiful place to visit and i would love to get down there one of these days for non-work related reasons - i will actually be there on monday all day for meetings and interviews for work. (very exciting stuff). i'll pump some of the people i have to interview for places to visit in the area. i'll let you know if i find out anything interesting for ya!    all righty, it's time to hit the hay! it's exhausting living this life of leisure ;-) too bad it's back to the grind on monday...have a great weekend everyone!!!
