Well I managed to make it to Thailand safely so that's a good start.  GJ and I found a pretty darn good place to stay and just ate some great food.  To top it all off we're now in a little computer room typing away.  I'm not sending much mail b/c this computer takes forever to do just about anything.  I sent one to my parents and that's gonna be all for now I think.  Thailand is really cool and I look forward to the next 4 days or so.  I'm so glad to have a break from Korea for awhile.  But I realize by the time this is all over I'll be so happy to get back there.  We're basically staying near the "Itawon" district in Bangkok so there are tons of whities around.  I'm not sure exactly what we'll do tomorrow but I think we'll hit up some of the major sights.   Last night was a lot of fun.  Thanks for the warm send off guys.  We played drinking board games at a board game cafe.  It was bitter sweet b/c they had alcohal but not the game we wanted, Risk.  But it all worked out well in the end.  I had to say my good-byes to Tim but I hope at some point I'll see him again.
