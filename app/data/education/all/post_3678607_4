I am watching ER and in the plot there are a few girls covered in cow blood. They were protesting the use of cats in lab testing. I once dissected a kitten. In Biology Freshman year. Yeah, I had a great teacher, Mrs. Bruce I LOVED her, she was awesome, she failed me, but she was great. My Big brother is going off to church camp today, I will be very bored without him. Oh well, I'll still have Sol, but all he does is sleep, I guess thats what you do when you're 8 and incredibly lucky. I wish we were back in school already, I am so bored already. I really have no one to hang with because I disowned my "friends" and I guess I feel bad about it. My two ex-friends Jess and Jack are most likely spending every moment possible together, I don't know if that is really unusual, but they've gotten really close... Hmmm, I wish I had a good book to read, but I still have overdue library books, good for me.  My dad's friend just had a baby Saturday, I wish a had a baby to play with, there is no one else, except Sol, but again, He's sleeping. I want to know what they named thier newborn, I know it's a girl, she was 2 weeks early. Okay, I will get back to my ER. More Later...
