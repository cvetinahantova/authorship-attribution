I heard this song on Jo Whiley's show driving home for Easter; it made be double take.   Isn't it a great confession.     "Breathe Me  Help I have done it again I have been here many times before Hurt myself again today And the worst the worst part is there's no one else to blame  be my friend hold Me, wrap me up unfold me, I am small and needy warm me up and breathe me  Ouch I have lost myself against Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found yeah I think that I might break lost myself again, i feel unsafe  be my friend hold Me, wrap me up unfold me, I am small and needy warm me up and breathe me"  Today I bought the whole  urlLink Sia  album.   Its very good, most of the songs are about love or heartbreak (so that some reviewers dismissed it as a heartbreak album when it came out in march) and can be melancholy.  But theres a lot of hope in there too, and forgiveness.    Sia's voice is amazing and gives the whole album an intimate feel.  The beats and music are very interesting too, not just a vehicle for the Songs.  Sia has done some songs with Zero 7 but I reckon her own music is better.
