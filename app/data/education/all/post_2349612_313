"because of [my] responsible credit history" (laugh #1), i've won "a check for $1600 to go on a cruise to las vegas".    last i checked vegas was kinda landlocked, so i'm not quite sure how that works.  all they want in return is me to fill out an evaluation of my trip when i return... and for the $1600 to be the first bit i owe on a new credit card.  such a cheesy ripoff, and they need better editors.  lunch, and back to work =P
