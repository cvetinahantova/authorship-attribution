"What a day to begin with?" Never in my life had I dont something like this, so I think it is something new and interesting to me LOL. I cant believe that this is the very first thing I do since I woke up an hour ago. I am a person who do things base on my feelings and this is unexpected. It was my heart telling me to create a blog today. Talking about it, I feel weird. We cant let feelings control us sometimes, though. Human beings still have to think before they act. I am currently a student and just turned 23. I cant imagine that I have lived 23 years of life yet i dont feel like 23 at all. Life is full of experiences and unexpected events. I reckon knowing a person doesnt need to know everything at one go. We need to study through their daily activities and pick bits and pieces out of it and put them together just like a jig saw puzzle. "Isnt it interesting?" haha.... I really cant wait to start to enter into world where I can get to work. People normally says, 'Dont be silly, once you are out of University, you will need to go into another type of university called 'Social University', where it is a world of reality and harshness. Well, I am not afriad of the challenges ahead, as I always reckon, we, Human beings, are born with a mission and we are here to do something. Everyone has to undergo this, so why not we just pluck up out courage and face these challenges in life. Nothing in life is a bed of roses. So, just be cool as whatever happens in life, it is going to reveal...
