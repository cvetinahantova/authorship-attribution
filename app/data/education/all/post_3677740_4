most people would say that i have a bag of humor slinged on my right shoulder, so when people seems to be lonely, sad or they just have the regular dose of anxiety attacks they tend to look at me.  then they laugh  (at that point i try to understand that it is not my face that is funny, maybe it is my personality, now if that could be true should i not feel bad about myself?)    well, i came up with a lists of my unforgettable punchlines which some of you can use to brighten up your day:    SCENARIO ONE:    From a classic college story, one time i came to the classroom and i saw a friend of mine he was looking weary so i asked him-   JEN: O bakit ang lungkot mo?  FRIEND: Wala..may problem lang sa bahay...  JEN: Ano?  FRIEND Ewan ko ba feeling ko isa akong BLACK SHEPHERD   (the minute i heard the word black shepherd, i knew something was wrong but i wasn't able to pin point it there and then)    SCENARIO TWO:    FRIEND: Jen kain ka muna ng pruits...  JEN: Sige, ano bang meron?  FRIEND: Affles, Oranges meron ding Finya   (hmmm...speech defect?)    SCENARIO THREE:    This is a favorite in JSI   BOY: Miss Pwede ka bang ligawan?  JEN: Ngayon na?   (Daig ng maagp ang masikap!)    SCENARIO FOUR:    Try this masaya   STUDENT: Mam ang ganda nyo ngayon ah...  JEN: Kung maganda ako ano ka pa? Diyosa? tandaan mo papatayin ko kung may mas gaganda pa iyo!     SCENARIO FIVE:    Try this if you'd be a speaker for a seminar   FACILITATOR: Mam, how do we address you?  JEN: (All smiles) Former binibining pilipinas universe    *the facilitator will laugh her/his heart out as soon as she copes up with the shock     SCENARIO SIX:    Try this if you fel like you want to be hurt   Look at a person you don't know and start teasing him/her with an inanimate object (eg. chair, desks, ballpens)    SENARIO SEVEN:    When somebody asks you what is your profession tell him/her with out thinking twice that you are a 'MUSE'   JOB TITLE: MUSE  JOB DESCRIPTION: To inspire and to be beautiful at all times.    SCENARIO EIGHT:    Act like Melanie Marquez   (though personally i like her)    SCENARIO NINE:    Talk to my mom (she's ilonga)   NANAY: Jini, tilipon  JEN: Sino daw po nay?  NANAY: Jime daw...   Now was that Jaime or Jimmy...i guess i have to find out...    SCENARIO TEN:    Save the best for last.  Note: This is a true story   Listen to your father as he sing  'PUFF THE MAGIC RACOON'     *partida videoke yun...
