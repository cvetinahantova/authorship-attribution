having worked a 30 hour week in 3 days basically, i'm tired... got to 402 contacts before i quit at 8:30 tonight, so go me!  then, after dinner and chatting with my brother for half an hour, (brother quote of the day: "so i asked dad what exactly they do at 'strategic planning meetings' for the botanic garden... he said they're trying to brainstorm and come up with a new attraction... so i suggested they hire a clown that juggles pitchforks of flaming manure... he somehow didn't find it that funny, but what do you think?")...ben and i saw another movie... after van helsing and the crazy indian movie, i had earned another chick flick, so we saw "raising helen"...  while not the best movie of all time, we both left the theater going "dude, well, that was cute"... the movie also gets bonus points because (1) they actually gave NJ Transit trains a good rap =) (2) kate hudson's character falls for a hockey goalie lutheran pastor... (there were horrible horrible religion jokes that ensued, but it was cute nonetheless... best quote of the movie? after a little bit of kate hudson being weird about the guy just because he was a pastor, he ended a paragraph with "... but that's ok because i'm a sexy man of God and i know it") (3) finally, the movie gets bonus points for having several places in it that ben and i could poke each other and go "we were there last week!  we were there last week!"... there was even a closeup of a cow at the central park zoo that i have my picture with from february... i laughed =P  the end -- jessica comes in the morning! =) time for me to get some shut eye before she does =P
