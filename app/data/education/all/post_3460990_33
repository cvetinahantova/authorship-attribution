For as long as I can remember, people have been telling me I look just like my mother. However, if I was actually  with  my mother, she would tell me later, "They don't know what they're talking about. You actually look just like your father."  And I believed her. I mean, she IS my mom, after all.  Then, I found this:  urlLink    My mom, approx 1977  urlLink     urlLink   urlLink   And, the picture of my mom putting a scarf on my head...so funny, because I actually wore that yellow and blue shirt (mom made it herself in Home Economics!) while I was in college. Haha!  Doncha just love nostalgia?
