I really don't have a lot of time to write b/c I spent most of my time reading everyone else's blogs.  It is a little strange how enjoyable it to read them sometimes.  Gabe put up the mother of all posts which I just got done reading.  I just got a passport photo taken.  Fountain and I are going to try and take a trip to Shanghai over the Chinese New Year break and I need it to get my visa.  The Chinese suck man.  They've gotten rid of group visas and now you can only get personal ones which a hella lot more expensive.  Screw it, the trip is cheap enough and should be fun.  It will be good to get away for awhile.   Thursday was Sarah's last night.  I don't know how it got so late but I ended up at home in bed a little before bed.  Somehow we ended up in a singing room at some point.  But I guess she needed to go there before she left.  We went to Amicus and Pulse.  I like Amicus a lot but it is just too damn expensive and the beer really wasn't all that.  The live entertainment was all good though and a nice change.  We had some crazy bread side dish which was really great but I ate like half of it and couldn't drink for the next two hours.  Dinner at the best restaurant in Daegu preceded Amicus.  There seemed to be a little drama in the air from some reason or other.   My guilty confession for the day, I ate sam gyup sal again last night.  I think I need to check into rehab.
