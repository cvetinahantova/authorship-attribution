I just wanted to say thank you to Dj for that wonderful present. I know that this is very late. And that I was given the pressie a long while ago.... But I don't care. It's beautiful and I wanted everyone to know. He gave me a silver jewelry box for my birthday. (Late birthday.) But it's still nice. I told everyone that I didn't want anything and only 2 of my best friends (the best of the best of the best of my friends) took me seriously. I thank them for that.  Â   Peaces for now,  Lysie
