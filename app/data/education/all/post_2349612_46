15 = cumulative hours of sleep since saturday 24 = number of math problems i've solved between saturday and now (7 complex analysis, 5 real analysis, and 9 algebra) 15 = number of math problems i need to solve in the next 48 hours (10 complex analysis, and 5 algebra)  and yeah.... this about sums it up: lkp 42 42 42: i'm going to spontaneously explode and you're not davrbeagle: but you solved that analysis problem lkp 42 42 42: and then found out i didn't and then resolved it davrbeagle: well, that's good lkp 42 42 42: indeed davrbeagle: so why are you going to spontaneously excplode? lkp 42 42 42: because i have slept a total of 15 hours since saturday davrbeagle: oh davrbeagle: that'd do it lkp 42 42 42: and i have more work to do in the next two days than i've accomplished since saturday mostly working nonstop davrbeagle: that sounds like lots of fun lkp 42 42 42: and that's not counting the class i'm 62 problems behind on lkp 42 42 42: so after friday i still have a ton of junk to do davrbeagle: sounds like you'll at least be kept out of trouble lkp 42 42 42: i'm never in trouble davrbeagle: because you never get caught lkp 42 42 42: but this makes me more prone to caffeine drinking spurts lkp 42 42 42: which makes me crazy and in trouble davrbeagle: ah, true lkp 42 42 42: 2nd worst caffeine high of the year was night before last lkp 42 42 42: the people laughed a lot davrbeagle: at least you still bring amusement wherever you go lkp 42 42 42: i know but that's not always good davrbeagle: why not? lkp 42 42 42: because sometimes that means i'm bringing amusement becauise i'm not in control of myself (i.e. high on caffeine) lkp 42 42 42: and that's not good davrbeagle: oh, ok. I can see how that would be bad lkp 42 42 42: after a caffeine high i remember the previous day only vaguely and have a horrible headache the next day lkp 42 42 42: it's kinda like some people on a hangover after drinking alcohol lkp 42 42 42: i have a caffeine blackout after enough caffeine davrbeagle: wow lkp 42 42 42: yeah davrbeagle: and you keep having that much of it? lkp 42 42 42: the people laugh and wonder why it affects me so drastically lkp 42 42 42: well, i did one of these in septemer and one this week lkp 42 42 42: i just get a starbucks or something... am still working later and like a 20oz coke sounds good lkp 42 42 42: then maybe get something else even later lkp 42 42 42: and all the sudden out of nowhere i'm typing like 160 word per minute and bouncing so that i can't sit still enough to work and telling everyone else they look lethargic lkp 42 42 42: and just completely off the wall lkp 42 42 42: you can pinpoint the 5 minute time period where it kicks in lkp 42 42 42: and i just accelerate from there for awhile until i crash and feel like crap in the AM  kinda makes you wish you were me, eh?  i'm fired. =P
