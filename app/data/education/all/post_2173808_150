This comment just came in about the Keye's selection:   BTW, I am sure that somehow this is all the fault of the Chicago Cubs. I just haven't figured out how to prove the connection yet, but when I do....   Perhaps when the Bartman ball was blown up, the curse of the Cubs escaped into the air and transferred itself onto a passing Illinois Republican (you know, kinda like that creepy Denzel Washington movie a few years back).  That would mean a Cubs World Series victory AND the political wilderness for the Illinois GOP.  Let's hope so.
