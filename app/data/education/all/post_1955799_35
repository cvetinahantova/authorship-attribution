Today I got a letter in the mail telling me I didn't get the job.  Boy that smarts so bad.  I really wanted to break into a new position.  I suppose I will have to bide my time.  I know there is something better out there for me, so I won't give up.  I do however feel like I'm chasing my tail.  If  a job won't come to me, I'll guess I'll have to make one of my own.  Something's gotta come my way.  On a good note, I don't feel like I'm in a funk.  I'm not angry or upset.  It must have something to do with the fact that I prayed a lot about this interview, and promised myself that I would make the best impression I could.  That way if I didn't get the job, it wouldn't be due to any deficiencies I had at the time.  I did make an impression, just one they wanted.    I'm going to pray that I become a better writer, and that I start selling some of my short stories, so I can have something on the side that keeps me going.  Because at the end of the day, I need to feel like heading somewhere other than nowhere.
