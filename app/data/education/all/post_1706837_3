last night, the MANDITORY activity was an hour and a half of the Dating Game.... six people (who can speak french well) were *randomly* picked throughout the day and were given personalities. that right there makes it not as fun, because things have been predetermined. it was still better than Family Feud last week though, because at least there was audience participation (we got to shout things like AHHH! and YARCK! *no one know what on earth yarck means lol*). after that, we went to the games room where we sat and listened to Chris play the piano. i think ive heard him play the same songs (since he's learning them) so much that I could just about play them, and i dont know anything about music LOL. i dont bother me to listen to him practice though, cuz sometimes you just need to relax, and hes REALLY good. when we got back to the residence, i noticed that my bus pass and internet pass were in my mailbox... i dont know how on earth they got there, because im POSITIVE i put them in my wallet, but i got them back, so im happy!  today in class, we did the verb tense Subjunctif Present.... me and the other Mike in my class were the only ones who had NEVER seen it before, but its hard so we didnt feel stupid. And then when the teacher said she would make photocopies of practice sheets for us, everyone else said they wanted them too, so apparently even the people who know it dont know it! :)  thats all i have for today... slightly less than yesterday. i think we're going to Wal*Mart this evening to purchase things we need, and to develope more pictures. now its off to lunch, cuz i only have an hour before workshop time! Au revoir!
