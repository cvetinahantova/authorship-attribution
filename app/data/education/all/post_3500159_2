Well, we survived our vacation.  It was cold and rained a lot but still beats the heat of Texas in June.  Spending time with 35 relatives is quite an undertaking....and then there are those who come home with you for another week!    Got a call today that my dear friend lost her baby boy at 22 weeks gestation.  How can that be fair when that baby was wanted so much?   It is hard to understand sometimes.  The summer is passing quickly.....maybe we can get some things accomplished before school starts back up.... Why is it time goes so fast when you need it to go slowly????
