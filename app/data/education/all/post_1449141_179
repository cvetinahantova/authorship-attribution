FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE MAY 27, 2003 12:25 PM  CONTACT: Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich  Doug Gordon (202) 225-5871, (202) 494-5141        Kucinich: Administration's Rhetoric Towards Iran Is Dangerous and Destabilizing;  Aggressive Approach To Iran Could Further Isolate US From International Community And Further Erode US Standing In The World      WASHINGTON - May 27 - The Administration's increased rhetoric and aggressive approach towards Iran is a dangerous and misguided policy which could further destabilize the region and further isolate the United States from the international community, Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich stated today.   Today, Kucinich, Ranking Member of the Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, issued the following statement:   "The increased rhetoric and the aggressive approach that this Administration is threatening towards Iran is a dangerous and misguided policy that will destabilize the region and further isolate the United States from the international community.   "The rhetoric and posturing by this Administration serves only to validate impressions in the region that the United States is empire building.   "It is disturbing that as the nation is just beginning to learn that it was misled in the build-up to war in Iraq, that this Administration is seeking to continue its dangerous policy in the region with an aggressive posture towards Iran.   "The Middle East region is at a critical juncture. Now more than ever, it is critical that the United States work with our friends and allies in the region to root out terrorists cells and implement a peaceful solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Now is not the time for a continuation of this Administration's misguided policy of preemptive and unilateral war."  ###      Common Dreams NewsCenter is a non-profit news service providing breaking news and views for the Progressive Community.
