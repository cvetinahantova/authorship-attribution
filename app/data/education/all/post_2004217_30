I am currently experiencing another very odd moment. My darling sister has just informed me that one of the guys (this is debatable) from JYF, the one who likes to cross dress, has officially changed his name to a girl's name and started taking oestrogen supplements. This may not strike you as totally freaky; weird, maybe, but not scary from my perspective. But here comes the best bit. Before "the change" he was called Robin- after, he/she/it is called JESSICA ROSE, which, if you will remember correctly, is MY DAMN NAME!! I was sooo weirded out when Em told me, I mean, how scary is that?? What if he's stalking me? *checks under desk*  Ceff x   My girlfriend is a wannabe...
