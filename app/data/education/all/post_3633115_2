I now have 5 $100 bills in my hand.  S sold our non-functioning mustang today.  These people actually paid money to buy a car that doesn't work, and they are going to find the trailer to come and get it.  Some folks are just nuts.  All I care about is the $500 I have that is terribly burning a hole in my pocket.  Ahh...the voice of reason and practicality is speaking to me once again. ( pay the bills )  Stupid reality.
