See my new tattoo???  urlLink     Yeah, so it's only a Henna tattoo, so it'll be gone in about 2 weeks or so, but it will be fun while it lasts.  They've been doing special things at work for the kiddos, and today it was henna tattoos.  Cool beans.  Two ladies that I work with got their own tattos, so I decided to go ahead and do it.  Wow.  I like the way it looks on my hand, so if I ever get an inkling to get a real tattoo of my own...  Right...!  Not much has happened the last few days...just that we are getting ready to go to the lake this weekend, and I am so excited.  Abbie's excited, too, because we keep telling her everything we will get to do, like fishing and swimming.  YAY!  (She's never been to the lake.)  OH, YEAH...we got  DirecTV  with  TiVo !  Yeah.  So, lately, we have mostly been sitting around watching all our new TV channels, and that's why I haven't been writing.  (Not exactly, but, hey, it's an excuse!)
