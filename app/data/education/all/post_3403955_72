I have always been afraid to start this particular journey. I am not sure what of failure or dissatisfaction. I am still going to be able to enjoy. I also am a little afraid about becomeing obsessive. Especially since so many people I know are obsessed once thay get on this journey. Seeing mom let me believe that I have the abilitiy to get on this journey. Even if it means changing my life a little bit.
