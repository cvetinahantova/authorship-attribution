San Ramon, CA - Spoke at a National Blue Ribbon School, Iron Horse Middle School.  It was one of the top schools I have ever experienced.  The principal, Kirby Hoy, was exceptional and his staff and students refelct that.  I am so proud to have had the chance to be part of such a great school ohana.
