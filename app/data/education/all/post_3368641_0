Predictable   hiding behind your masks and online productions crying foul - crying victim every time that you get revealed some playful masters make it their hobby to peel away the labels if you are not up to being exposed for your limitations then unplug from your fiction maker and return asleep to consensus reality  you wanted to have it both ways to feel the fire warm you and have use of it as a weapon you got burned twice as bad as someone who has never learned the place for humility in relationships and activities  amongst pseudo personalities where truth can't be trusted handed out as hors d'oeuvres  how quickly the victim in you puffed up their chest  and like the potentate of the sand box you kicked gritty words on anyone that dared to see you naked and were not impressed with the view  i am quietly amused at the very idea  that this angry little child was given the lead role at center stage it should have spoke volumes to the incredulous audience but they were afraid that in revealing her fiction it would somehow reflect off on them and they would have to admit their part in creating the life and living their own lies  this fear of owning scripts sometimes takes all the fun out of watching actors and actresses digging deep  into well produced roles their hopes for some golden reward laugh trax or stand up applause for the carrying of their crosses for being victims and heroines has made the plot lines  into something bordering  on predictable   Â©2003 DC Vision
