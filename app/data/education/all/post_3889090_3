I would go off the rails. I know I would. I would hire prostitutes to try and satisfy my lust issues. I would get involved with any old girl who came along. I would do anything that felt good. I would get depressed. If there is no God, there is no point to your life. I need to have a point to my life. I have this vague memory of a darkness with no future. That was the time before I was a Christian. I do need God. I need him all the time. Even if he doesn't speak to me ever, the assurance that he is interested in my life and is using me is enough. Really. Each day has a point and is a piece in the grand puzzle if God exists. If he doesn't, each day is just another day. You eat, you sleep. Maybe you have pleasure maybe you have pain. But your existence is of no importance and you are a nothing. That really sucks.     OK, so I cannot live without a purpose. I don't know why I need it so much. I can't live without God.
