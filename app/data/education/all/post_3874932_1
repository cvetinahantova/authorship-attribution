I do remember that one of the themes we have been considering for the Simpsons is that participation in the group does seem to be in part about competitive creativity.  I can't see our creative seniors, though, joining the Simpsons discussion list!  Are there other venues or types of products where competitive creativity is a motivation for consumption?  Maybe even fashion?  Or, online role playing games?
