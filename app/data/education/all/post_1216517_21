STUPID CONSUMER  I'm a sucker for good advertisement.  For instance, Jack-in-the-box is the king of funny commerials so whatever they're pushing, I'm buying.  I just got around to trying the Fish and Big Chips ("what you blokes call 'fish'  HA!) and the  urlLink Philly Cheesesteak  ('Yo, Jackie!  I soaked up Philly like a sponge' HA HA!)  both were yum.  I highly recommend both.   They're high quality for the fast food world.  And, i know i'm slacking, but i haven't savored the sweetness of the  urlLink Chipopitelote  yet.  It's next on my list. Yeah, what's up?  Jack-in-the-box is good, so is In N Out.  But McDonald, McDonald's is the best...  urlLink FOR ME TO POOP ON!!! .  Anyways, it goes back to the commercials.  I love a good commercial.  The commercials are my favorite part of the superbowl.  This past game we wrote down the ones we liked, so we could buy the product.  Bud Light was checked 4 or 5 times, too bad it sucks.  I think my favorite was the  urlLink  one where the naked dude ran all over the soccer field .  Now that was funny!   If it's funny, I'll buy it.   The guy working at Jack-in-the-Box was funny.  My meal was $5.32 and he said, "that will be five-hundred and thirty two."  then he said, "Here art thou cup.  That's Shakespeare.  I learned that when I was at Juliard."  He was a big Dip Cheese. I loved it.
