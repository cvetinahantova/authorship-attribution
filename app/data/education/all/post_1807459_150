All this time off and I still feel like I have no time.  I'm really tired.  I don't know what it is or why I'm not sleeping as well as I should be but it's really annoying.  Anyway things seem to be a hell of a lot more annoying when you're tired.  I have to go to the bank tomorrow and see why my money hasn't reached my account in the states.  This kind of stuff is a real pain in the ass.   I went to a baseball game for the first time yesterday and that was a lot of fun.  The Lions got pounded but get this.  They were up by 5 going into the 9th.  Then the other team managed to score 5 to tie it up.  Then they scored 6 more in the 11th.  What a mess.  The stadium is pretty small by werstern standards but nice enough.  I have work tomorrow.  I guess it is good I'm going to do something conrstructive.   I'm really looking forward to traveling soon.  I just want a break from the madness.   On a sad note WABA is closing for remodeling.  I can't imagine that it would really be closed.  That would just be terrible and I think I'd have to leave Korea forever.  Ok I'm just going to go home and get some sleep.  I feel like I should have more to say but I just don't.   Oh well I do have one thing.  Fenton, Caleb, Gyeh-son and I ate at Bennigans last night and as always all of our hamburgers and bacon were under cooked.  Anyway Gyeh-son complained and we all ate for free.  I felt a little bad b/c I enjoyed the hamburger despite it being a little pink.  But heck it was free so I shouldn't complain.  Also, I hate Koreans and cell phones.
