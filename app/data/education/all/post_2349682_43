This morning at 4:00 am we went to get all the senior's out of bed to come to breakfast with us, the catch was though that they couldn't get ready. Hannah, Obie and I had Jordan, Jake, and Erica to get up to bring to Denny's. We went to wake up Erica and she was like, why are you doing this? CUZ WE LOVE YOU, GET UP! After that she was like ok. Jordan was already awake since Obie called the house because they didn't answer after fifteen minutes so all Obie had to do was bring him. Jake's dog went crazy as soon as we knocked on the door Janet came to the door but I think she was still in her pj's because she was hiding behind the door. We woke up Jake he was like it's morning already I just went to sleep! Good Morning Jake now GET UP! John woke up and said what's happening guys? Whatcha doing? And it kind of seemed like he wanted to say I want to play! He asked if he could come to, it's just so crazy because he seemed wide awake. It was so much fun getting to bless the youth, when we were all at Denny's I got to see all the pictures that each leader took of the getting up part it was great. Mandy made some awesome graduation hats so the youth had to wear them in Denny's, Gabe and Jake kept putting their hats on my head. I am glad too that Angela and Robert, Maria, and Karri got to come as well. As much as I love this kids and as much as I love doing things like this I just have to say that 4 am is just to early! Even the early bird doesn't get up at that time cuz it's still sleeping. Luckily though I got to sleep as soon as I got home which was like 8:30. I woke up at 12:30 so I feel rested. So much Fun! So much Fun!
