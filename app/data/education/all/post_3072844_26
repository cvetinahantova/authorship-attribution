I have been trying to get a couple of pictures up here, just for fun, but it doesn't want to work when you publish a site via FTP. During the last few days i had posted three picture-posts, but now they all refuse to show up anything save a little white box with a red cross inside ... >sigh  There's never an end to computer problems. You know, it was pretty difficult to get this to public via FTP! I can't believe i managed it; i've never tried before.  Anyway, that's enough complaining, i'm going to miss my bus if i'm not careful.  It's so hard not to write 'luv Charlie' cos i finish my diary like that each day. Ah, what the hell.  love The Green Aardvark
