urlLink I am not involved in emerging church  is a very cool story.  Particualrly like this quote/definition:    "emerging church is a passion for people who are stuck with a congregation of people who don't understand half of what they say. emerging church has indeed emerged from the big stone doors of the so called local church to move themselves (usually a 18-30s group) down the road to the pub. the emerging church can now express themselves in the language they use (graphics, candles, trance music, beer, whatever)."
