I think suffer from some weird form of insomnia.  I consume almost no caffine at all. I try to eat healthy and on a regular basis. I exercise in the mornings.  Yet, somehow, I am plagued by a likely nonexistent form of insomnia that doesn't allow me to sleep regardless of how exhuasted I am.  My eyes burn in their sockets.  My headaches increase in severity.  My thoughts become somewhat jumbled yet somehow clearer than before.  I lose all ability to focus in every sense of the word.  However, upon resting my head on my incredibly wonderful  urlLink tempur-pedic pillow , my eyes close and my brain keeps on going.  I think I'll go and lay awake for a while.
