yeah, i just noticed that some people actually have semi-interesting things on here. don't worry, i won't pretend that anyone cares what i write or will ever see it. i'm just one of the freaks on the border between generations x and e: bitter and sarcastic, nothing interesting, nothing new. if you want to read what i write, you can go anywhere. no need to come here.  i read the other day that there's apparently a generation m now. i thought i was old when i found out i was technically both x and e, being born in 1979, the border year. so when was the border between e and m? and why do i keep getting older?  i will admit my life has more meaning than i probably let on on this stunted attempt at a journal. after all, the times i feel most like writing are the times i feel most irritated and bereft.  so feel secure, take hope, that i actually do have life. and it's a happy one. we have problems, yes. but so does everyone. and the good thing is that our problems aren't so bad. more importantly, we have each other to lean on. like that one song. some idiots sang that right before my high school graduation. no wonder they all died in that stupid earthquake.  anyway, now that my mood is back to normal i'm getting in the mood to go read for a while. preferably stephen king. in the middle of gerald's game right now. it's not exactly like his other work.  but still interesting.  alley just walked up. i was realizing that she'd been gone for an hour and was just about to start worrying. looks like i don't have to after all.
