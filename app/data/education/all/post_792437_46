Quote    Â  I found a quote, well I've known it for a while, but I just have been thinking about it. The quote is "Well behaved woman rarely make history" by J. Ulrich. This gets me thinking, because does a woman have to do something that is out of the ordinary to make history...why? Have men had to do that? I've heard of behaved men making it far, but why do woman have to do something beyond the norm to do just the same as their counterparts? hmmm....what a society..
