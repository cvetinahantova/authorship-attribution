Kyrie elison, Christe elison, Kyrie elison...  I saw Secret Window yesterday. It was okay. It's one of the only movies I've seen where the bad guy wins or at least the good guy doesn't win. Besides "The Empire Strikes Back," which ends with Han Solo getting dipped in chocolate and Luke getting his hand chopped off. Other than that...yeah...it was pretty good. Johnny Depp is hot with messy dyed hair and even without eye makeup.  I was going to go on a field trip with my Sunday School class to the John Paul II Cultural Center, but not enough people wanted to go. It was a bit short-notice, but I thought it might have been fun...maybe...  Not much else is going on, really...
