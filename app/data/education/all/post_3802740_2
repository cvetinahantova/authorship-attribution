With finals right around the corner, there hasn’t been a whole lot of outside thinking on my part.  No outside thinking makes this Web log quite boring, so I decided to take a little bit of time this evening to devote to an update.   Lora and I have been working pretty hard on the kitchen and to be quite honest, it is very near completion.  I think some touch-ups will have to be done, but compared to the project as a whole, that is rather minute.  It was a rather large project, but it is honestly quite rewarding seeing all of the hard work come to a symphonic close.   Three more days until the end of the summer semester and only two more semesters until the graduate degree is complete.  Then what you may ask?  Well who knows at this time?  I have been thinking about pursuing a concentration in something along the lines of organizational behavior or internal auditing.  I haven’t quite made up my mind, but I tend to gravitate to these types of classes.
