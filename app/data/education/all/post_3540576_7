Wow...  summer has finally arrived!  It's been in the mid 20's for the past few days, and as such, left me quite uncomfortable.  I've never really responded well to the heat, and I now recall why.  I sweat.  Lots.  Too much I think.  Oh well, need to start sucking it up, as hopefully I'll be in Japan soon, and it's very hot & humid there.  Not too much to say right now, just really wanted to drop to to keep this thing current.  I've been in a decent mood lately, so that's always nice.  I'll be back soon, promise.
