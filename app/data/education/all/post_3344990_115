What that means to you is while the domain is down all of my blog pictures are missing. Our ministry server located at Jesus Connect.net had a crash this weekend and my friend in Houston Texas is in the process of reloading everything.  I hope that he had a good backup and that in a matter of days everything will be back online as it was.
