Well after getting the girls out to their Saturday club and having dodged the rain showers at work, I got home to a grateful rest. Well thats what I thought.     Sandra had arranged for us to go out and play happy couples at our friends house round the corner.   While Sandra had a shower, I lay on the bed trying to grab some rest. The temptation while she was getting ready was too much and I asked if we could have sex. Her reply of "if you have to" was met by her taking her towel off, lying on the bed, closing her eyes, parting her legs and saying "hurry up"....I did!     Armed with a bottle of red, we made our way over for tea (at 20:30) I was starving, having already rung to see if I could have a pack of chips at 17:30 to tide me over - our host suggested a banana.     We arrived and sat at opposite ends of a 4 seat sofa, which I found amusing        The meal was nice, a mousaka, although it wasn't that filling, with just a salad to go with it. By the time we had finished coffee, I was shattered and we got home before midnight, with Paul and I having arranged to go to the gym in the morning.
