IDEALS, TRAVELLER HIGH, AND PEEWEE'S BIG ADVENTURE tomorrow frank and i are meeting in coban to explore the mystic falls and enchanting waters of samuc champey (at least that's how my guide book describes it and i believe EVERYTHING it says). adios san pedro, i barely knew you.  i need to take a trip without any time constrants sometime.  i'm envious of those that say, "yeah, i think i might kinda have to be up in mexico city sometime maybe in august or something.  i don't know.  we'll see.  i might make it by then." i have the traveller's high though.  everything seems really cool and interesting and exciting.  it is, don't get me wrong.  but are things just like that because i'm experience this outside of america?  billy and i talked about this.  stuff like, "that girl is so beautiful!", " that view is so amazing."  But...if i saw the same thing, or the same instance happened to me at home is it really that beautiful or amazing?  honestly, i'll live in ignorant bliss if i must.  i love the ideal.  you say, "this is the greatest thing ever!" but then experiencing it out of your context sours the whole deal.  for instance, i always thought that 'peewee's big adventure' was the greatest film ever made.  that was when i was 10.  i hadn't seen the film for about 10 years, but still claimed it was the best ever.  now i love peewee, but the jokes weren't as funny, peewee wasn't as cool, large marge not as scary, the lost of pee wee's bike wasn't as worrisome.  anyway, the moral of this story is, as long as i don't watch that peewee movie while on my trip, guatemala will be the coolest place ever.
