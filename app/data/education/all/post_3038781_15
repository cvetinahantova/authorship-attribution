Ack, so much for my daily adventures in life... the final exam has started EEEEk... where's my coffee, wipped chocolate cheese cake [sic: I don't suppose the Women's Institution for Public Policy is currently selling cheesecake with their memberships, but they should.] oops, back to the mindless tirade, where's my coffee [hey it always bears repeating] and where's my double chocolate whipped cheese cake [same theory] and my mood music, and while I'm at it where's my mind because I must have left it somewhere along with the answers that I knew I knew yesterday.   What's up?   Surely, you didn't think I'd forget my question of the day? Did ya? There - there are three questions for the price of one.
