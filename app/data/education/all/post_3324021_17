Today the books you helped collect were given to those who need them most. I'm sorry to say I wasn't there, but it wasn't necessary for me to be there. I did actually, in contrary to popular opinion, have something else to do. I had a paper for Ajavon due today that I had not started till this morning. Maybe it wasn't necessary for me to wait till the last minute to call and tell her (And I do mean last minute!) but you know what, she does that to the rest of the council all the time. She never tells us anything in advance, we all found out about this yesterday, and even at that she wouldn't share any details, just to be at her house at 7 AM. So I said, screw this, you aren't gonna give me any info, I'm not going. This all leads back to the consolidation of power thing (See Post "A Major Consolidation of Power") But I really do hope those kids enjoy the books.
