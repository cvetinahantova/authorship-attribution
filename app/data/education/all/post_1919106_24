*You*   You who treat others like you're doing them a favor. You who mingle among my friends sowing the seeds of dissent. Yes, YOU. You better watch out pal, because not everyone has the patience I do. And my own patience is running low, and when it drains away then you get to face Him, and He is not someone you would like to meet. Heck, not even I would like for Him to see the daylight ever again. You are threading dangerous ground here, demanding favors in exchange for nothing. Good people don't demand favors, ever. They give them out, and they get them when needed. Favors are no currency. So you better think about what you're doing.
