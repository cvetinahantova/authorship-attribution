So..Saturday night was my party, and it was okay excpet for the fact that I can't drink and the fact that a lot of my friends left really early. But it's cool cuz I got to know my new neighbors, not to mention all their cute friends, so that was cool. Joe and Blake win the prize for having the best time while they were here. They rocked the beer pong table and probably got the most drunk. Today is the first day of school, but not for me because I am cool. And cool people don't have classes on Mondays...or Fridays. Maybe after I start taking my steroids my headaches will go away and I can be cool again like how I used to be, when I didnt suck so much ass. The new guys moved in last night, Danny and Ante. And they are cool, not to mention some nice eye candy. They both have the phattest rooms in the house, which I would be jealous about if I hadnt turned my room into a Sexy Bachelorette Pad. Yeah thats right. It's sexy. Very pink and very rosey. And it smells like girl too. Yes people, I have transformed into a girl. Another way in which I suck now...disappointing I know, but don't you worry. I'll be back in the game, beating you men at vodka shots soon enough. Some day....(sigh).
