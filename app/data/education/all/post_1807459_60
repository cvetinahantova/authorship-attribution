I don't even know where to begin.  First, that is awesome they caught Saddam.  I was watching a movie when Gabe text messaged me the good news.  Last night was a lot of fun.  I'm really tired though and I'll go home and hit the sack after I'm done with this.  There was a gathering at Meabh's but I was absent b/c I'd made plans to meet Ju-mi again.  We ate and drank some soju.  This is after I had already eaten with Caleb at possibly the best restaurant in Daegu.  But it was cool b/c I was hungry and we at sam gyup sal which is something I love more then words can describe.  Well we ate up and the moved to a Jazz club.  She went home after that and I hooked up with the homies at The Commune.  I was really full, but more on that later.  We then moved to Gypsy Rock where I met a captain in the Korean army and danced the night away with a science teacher in the cage.  We then rolled to upstairs but it was pretty bland actually.  It seemed everyone had a good deal to drink.   I didn't sleep very well last night due to all the damn pork I ate.  Not only that but I didn't eat anything all day and was never hungry.  That's odd.  Has my body lost the ability to digest pork?  I finally ate something about 10 or so just because.  Either way I think I'll go easier on it next time.  Today was simple.  I hung out with Becky in Seattle's and then watched Hollywood Homicide.  Not a good movie but good enough for Korea.  I also picked up two more Korean books as I have finished my others.  I've slacked off on my book but I intend to put a little more effort into it.   I wish I had more free time.  But hell I only work about 4-4.5 hours a day.  What the hell am I saying?  How will I adjust to real life?  I always feel like I have more to say but I can never remember what it is when I come to write.  I hate that.
