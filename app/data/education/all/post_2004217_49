HMPH. Much to (I assume) everybody's delight today, school was closed due to the snow. That's one good thing about it I suppose. It snowed on and off all day yesterday, except for the 20 minute period when I walked from school to the bus stop, where the temperature rose and the snow turned into huge great dollops of rain water, thoroughly soaking me. Thanks a lot. Other than that, yesterday was a pretty normal day, except that some cheeky year 10 or 11 made fun of my earmuffles. Stupid girl, does she not think I can hear her when I've got them on? They don't have music playing in them, dumbass. Although that would be cool...  HMPH. Valentine's Day is fast approaching and I am fast becoming more and more miserable about the whole red-coloured affair. No boyfriend, no crush, no life.   HMPH. Richard can't come to the JYF committee meeting. How selfish of him to deny me the perfect opportunity to decide to be mean to him but then not go through with it.  On the bright side, I have the whole of today to do lots of interesting things like my English coursework. Woo.  Ceff x   Game over, it's no fun...
