Gaming   So... there seem to be some discrepancies between my friends at the gaming group... there's those who don't mind the Monday meetings being a social event, and there's those who are a wee bit upset because they think they're wasting their time. There's the ones who absolutely hate 3rd edition D&D and would much rather play something else, and then there's the ones who want to play D&D because they've been playing too many White Wolf games lately. I personally don't have a problem with either, but maybe that's because I'm not a harcore gamer. It's fun, but that's about it. I guess that with a bit of time everything'll work out just fine.    Underworld   I was watching the Daily Show last night, and they showed some new clips from the movie... they absolutely turned me down. Ultra-f**ing-violet light charged bullets? That's just idiotic! If you're going to use ultra-violet lights to kill a vampire then just open a damn tannign salon!
