I am really sorry for the puns.   We saw Spiderman 2 again last night. It was still great! I really love this movie, and still think that it's the best Superhero movie out there yet. Of course, Smallville gives it a run for it's money, but hey...we aren't talking about that! By the way, if you still aren't hooked (and live near me) I have the first two seasons on DVD, and the third is replaying right now before Season 4 starts, and from the stuff I've read online, this will be the best one yet.   Anyway, thanks to my Mother in Law who helped Beth do some work around the house, and then took us out for fun!
