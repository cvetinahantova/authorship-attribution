so i spent almost $200 today and it wasn't my money.. know how awesome that is? lol. i spent a couple hours at big splash and ran into some ppl i know. mostly kids from before/after. and then after that i watched Mary Kate and Ashley Getting There.. and no it wasn't to rehab! what a loser.. she has everything and she's starving herself? god i wish i was rich and famous.. MOVING ON. i have absolutlely nothing to talk about tonight. my day was boring. but i don't have to like seriously babysit tomorrow, this little boy up the street and his mom are coming over and she's really cool. she was over a little today and we talked. so that's cool.   i decided today i want a hat. i will probably get that friday or sat after i get paid. i like hats and i'm tired of having to resort to 'borrowing' them from guys. i want my own darn it. i really liked Brandon's gray OSU hat but the only thing keeping me from buying is the fact that it would remind me of him! so that's my goal for this weekend.. buying a hat..  I'm Ashley.. and i approve this blog.
