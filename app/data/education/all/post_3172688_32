Hey...  Today was a good day. I didn't have any bad thoughts or do any bad things. I had a minor headache but all my teachers also had one so they kept all f the kids quite and mine didn't get the chance to grow during school because of it. Then I step into my house. My sister right off the bat makes me angry by not giving me my bus pass back. I would like to get some use out of it during the day, but she lets her friends borrow it for the night, then she doesn't get it back. Everyday my ex's sister wants me to ride the bus home with her so we can get here early to finish up with any homework before she has to go home, but I don't have any money (no, not even fifty cents) to get home. If we just walked we would reach my house right as soon as she would have to leave for her bus. It sucks that I can't rely on any of my friends, but now it's getting to the point to where I don't even rely on my sister anymore. Anyways, on with why my head is throbbing... So anyways, I took a nice, long, hot, shower to make myself feel better, and it was actually working too until my dad came home. I didn't see him until my mom came home and told me dinner was ready. As soon as I walked into the kitchen he started cursing at me for not making him some Kool-Aid. I couldn't believe it! Who would yell at another person just for not making them a retarded soft drink?  Anyways, I just wanted to give you an update on the headache that I've had for the past five days. Now I'm anticipating a nice, long, freezing cold air, walk down by the bay to see if it would make me less angry. Bye!
