Greetings fellow Bloggers!  I've tried several times in vain to link the sites from Blogger by following the directions given in "?Help", but it's not making the connection for some reason; I'll try again later.  Nonetheless, I'm going to press on with the assignment.  I will be using the following sites in my research:  http://www.teach-nology.com/teachers/lesson_plans/language_arts/speaking/  I will be referring to this one as the Super Speaker site.  The words " urlLink Super Speaker " will be what you will click on to link to this site once I figure out what the problem is.  This site is incredible.  It is a comprehensive site including many of the important elements of oral communication:  tips on public speaking, interviewing techniques, writing interviews, writing speeches, sample speeches, etc...There are a few sites I will direct the students to from here.  One of them is the "Putting it all Together" site that I indicate at the bottom of this list.  Another one not listed on these top three is a site containing a collection of famous American speeches that I will be directing them to as well.  In addition, I currently plan to give them the freedom to peruse this site for research picks of their own.        http://cspace.unb.ca/nbco/pigs/speaklist/inter1.html  I will refer to this site as the  urlLink Informed Interviewer  site.  This site will be used as a reference for a great class activity where the students will interview a fellow student and then present that person to the class; this exercise should help to "break the ice" before they have to give a speech independently.       http://www.abacon.com/pubspeak/  I will refer to this site as  urlLink Putting It All Together .  I plan on using this site as a sort of WebQuest.  It's very user-friendly and gives the students help by starting with a topic for their speech and then directs them to a finished product.  I don't expect that they will utilize every aspect of this site because it is fairly extensive.  I will help them by pointing out the most helpful aspects.
