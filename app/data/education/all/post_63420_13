Yesterday, after fetching a couple sacks of bird seed at the local Sears Hardware I happily wandered into the the nearby Starbucks to get a iced frappucino   on the balmy Saturday.  I had an extended wait. The baristas forgot/misplaced my order and I watched the 5 people in back of me get their drinks first.  Seated near the day's newspapers I stumbled across a recent business book (The 80/20 Individual) with a sticker on it saying "I'm Free".     After reading the sticker and the enclosed bookmark, I learned the book was  urlLink registered  at  urlLink bookcrossing , a site that facilitates the exchange of books by having members leave their books with the approporiate identifiable markings (the stickers and bookmarks) allowing the finders (me, in this case) to go online, register as a subscriber and tell the system that I have the book.  The idea is for people to freely get rid of books they don't want by leaving them at places like Starbucks.  What's the business model ?  Well, I guess the finders get satisfaction from finding books that might interest them without paying for them (sounds like a library, just potentially more exciting) and bookcrossing gets revenue from people who want to "release" their books by buying supplies (stickers, etc.).    Their site also allows you to do a scavenger hunt, of sorts.  You can look for what books are possibly available in your area and where.   Let's see if they're around in a year or two.  Was the barista's error just fate that allowed me to discover this new service ?  I don't know, but they did give me a coupon for a free drink at my next visit because of the inconvenience.  (And, no, I didn't complain to anyone to get the coupon.)
