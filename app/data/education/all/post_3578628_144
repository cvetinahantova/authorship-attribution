OLYMPICS   We all know the Olympics are coming up in Athens...which we are all looking forward to because that's where they started, but I have found out some interesting facts about some things people are having controversy over...   When the Olympics were started there was very little "technology" used in it.  I don't mean high tech score boards or computers or things, I mean the application of "developing" better equipment to improve time and performance.  When the Olympics go back to Athens the athletes will be using some of the latest technologically advanced equipment ever used, and some people don't like the idea.  Swimming, for example, has adopted the use of very smooth, fast, breathable, and "waterdynamic" clothing over the past few years that was never even thought of in the first olympics.  This, however, is raising question (*very little however*) as to whether or not the athletes should compete in Athens the "old fashioned way."  Obviously this will never happen, and not that many people care about it, but I just thought it was interesting that people actually wanted our athletes to compete the old fashioned way because we were doing it in the origin of the olympics.  Well...thats my story for today...look for us soon as more "exciting" stories develop I'm Josh Hall....wishing you a nice day!
