Congratulations! You're Legolas!    urlLink   Which Lord of the Rings character and personality problem are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Well, I've done it. I registered for classes. It's a weird schedule with one night class (since it's the only time it's offered) and huge gaps between some classes (oh, DARN! You mean I have to hang out in the computer lab?). Here's the lowdown...  * Christian Home (for my required Bible) * Shakespeare (towards my English minor) * Contemporary Drama * Theater History 2 * Play Production * Vocal Performance  And, of course, chapel every morning. Now I have to register my address with the housing office, get a chapel seat, choose an advisor, apply for entrance into the college of education,and-- oh yeah, see why my federal financial aid hasn't come through yet, since they won't let me into classes until they get my $2500 down payment. Apparently, everything got tossed out when I didn't start in the fall, despite the fact that I wrote SPRING 2004 as my entrance date. Yeesh.  So much to do, so little time. Gotta get it done before classes start next week.  My quote of the moment: "You think I don't have feelings? Well, you're wrong! I'm an ACTRESS! I have ALL of them!" -- Elise (Goldie Hawn),  The First Wives Club
