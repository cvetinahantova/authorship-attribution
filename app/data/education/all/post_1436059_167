Wow...Amanda was really down today...On GJ she wrote this:  "I wish this never happened. I wish I was never born. I wish I was someone else, somewhere else. I wish I was a different person, one with no friends...so no one would care so much about me. I wish I was in the Twin Towers when they collapsed I wish I was nicer, prettier, more confident. I wish I had talent. I wish I would die an' come back as someone else. I just wish everything was different, that no one cared, that I was alone, no family, that I didn't have feelings I wish I was dead...or that I'm not afriad to kill myself. But if I had a gun right now......I'm sorry Katy......sorry mom an' dad....sorry to everyone. I guess I have to revise my suicide letter now. But I swear, if I had a gun right now or some pills...damn, that'd be one sad story. A lotta sorrys. Just to say it now...I never meant to hurt anyone...I didn't do it on purpose an' I'm sorry...this is to anyone I've hurt in the past, an' now."  And I was like...WhOA!!!! So I wrote this to cheer her up...  "I wish I was prettier, I wish I had a guy that made me feel beautiful and made me feel important, I wish that I used the brain I have to get great grades and I wish I didn't slack on schoolwork like I do, I wish I had all these things that I don't have. And then, Amanda, I think about the things I do have. I have friends (usually) who don't care if I'm pretty or if I'm the butt-ugliest female on the planet, I don't have a boyfriend right now but I realize that if I went for so long, I could wait ten more years for the RIGHT one to come along, and I realize that having a brain and using it as much as I please is better than not having a brain at all, and I realize that all the things I don't have make me more thankful for the things that I  DO  have."  TOMORROW IS OUR YARD SALE!!! WHOOT. LoL...  So exhausted...
