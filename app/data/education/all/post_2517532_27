For my birthday, I got myself a new digital camera!  I have always wanted to get a good camera for as long as I can remember.  I have always been interested in photography, but I couldn't really buy one because that would be too much of a luxury (and I couldn't afford to get myself one, anyway!).   But, after saving for some months, saving the birthday cash-gift given to me by my parents and my aunt, saving some of the money I earned from my part-time job, I finally got my dream digital camera last week!!!:)   Now...  I can take pictures of anything I want.  I can finally take a picture of the view of that  Iglesia ni Cristo  church from the  UP Sports Oval  which never fails to take my breath away every single afternoon I pass by it.  I can take pictures of God's magnificence (nature).  I can take pictures of kids playing and running around.  I can take pictures of students around the  UP Sunken Garden  and the soccer players in the field.  I can take pictures of those  Atenistas  and  LaSallistas  playing  American Football  at the  Sports Oval .  I can take pictures of lovers and/or friends, under the shade of trees, lost in their own worlds.  I can take pictures of dogs sniffing around the campus.  I can take pictures of cute, lazy cats lying around the place.  I can take pictures of my beautiful, wacky, crazy friends!  I can take pictures of my cute nephews and nieces.  I can take pictures of my sister in all her moods.  I can take pictures of loved-ones.  I can take pictures of dear, dear  MSU !  I can take pictures that would always make me remember places and things not worth forgetting.  I can take pictures of anything and everything!:)  I am just so excited I can't stop grinning from ear to ear!  Wait, I think I need to take a picture of myself... now!:)
