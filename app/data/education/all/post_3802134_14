I just read that Paula Danziger, author of  The Cat Ate My Gymsuit  and many other great young adult books, died of complications from a heart attack.  I can't even begin to explain how much this news has bummed me out.  When I was in seventh grade, I won a chance to go see her speak at our local library, and I still remember her as one of the best speakers I've ever heard.  She was bright and funny, just like her books.  After the lecture I got to meet her, and when I told her I wanted to be a writer when I grew up she responded like that was the greatest news she'd ever heard and offered me all kinds of advice and encouragment.  Even though kids must've told her that all the time, she acted like it was the first time.  I still have a beat-up copy of  The Cat Ate My Gymsuit  that's inscribed with, "Dear Heather, Keep writing!  You can do it!  Paula Danziger."  I feel like a little piece of my childhood just died.
