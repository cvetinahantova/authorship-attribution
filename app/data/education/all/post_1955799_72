I have decided that i should not allow other factors in life to constrain me.  This means taking control of my life, time, and energies.  I want to be able to project the right amount of energies into my talents.  There should be no excuses, no explanations or justifications to others about what I do.    In the past I felt a need to please others, and I'm not happy.  I'd like to get to a point where my happiness and life come first, and not last.  I getting there.  Of course things don't happen overnight, and if I rememeber to do things the right way (put my needs and well-being first), then I can't possibly fail.  It shall all work itself out, if I maintain the right course.  I'm developing two new websites.  The first is my official home site.  This site will contain photos, poetry, and liks galore.  LOL.  I want it to be my special site.  The one I would want to design if I went to a professional and asked them to work on it.   The second will be a labor of love.  It's a site dedicated to fine art.  The details are still in the wash, but my background in art is my first love.     Song of the Day:     Talk About Love  by Brandy.  It is really a cool song, and is right for the summer.  If the opportunity presents itself, I'll purchase her new CD.
