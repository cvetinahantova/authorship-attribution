Howdy all,   I just wanted to congratulate Cait on quitting her job!  I also wanted to answer Donna's question about Phil's party.  Mike and I will be there, Tommy O will be on the Cape spending his last days before becoming a priest with his family.  Timmah is undecided I think.  First, he really wanted to go to the John Williams concert at Tanglewood, then when I said Mike and I would be going to Phil's he was going to go to Phil's.  Now he's talking about going to the Cape but stopping at Phil's on the way.  I kindly pointed out to him that the north shore was in no way on the route to the cape from the Worcester area.  So who knows what Timmah will do.  Phil's parties are always a good time, so I would highly recoomend going if at all possible.  Lots of people usually arrive like Checky, Rob Hymas, Brendan... people that we don't see very often.  I plan on spending the night at Phil's too (Phil hope you knew that already).  I just want to point out that Mike is currently sitting on the couch watching his third episode of A-Team in a row.  Yes, he owns Season 1 on DVD.  How is that entertaining?  I don't get it.  Hey Caddie... Mike was supposed to call you and ask you about this, but with his excellent procrastination techniques I doubt he has.  Anyway,  we are going to Chicago August 17 through August 22.  Are you going to be working in the Worcester area during that time?  Would you like to feed Bad Kitty?  Let me know either way.  Thanks.  So have a good Wednesday. It's a payday for me . . .  woo-hoo!  Karen
