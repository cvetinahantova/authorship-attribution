hey everyone,  well i got my new laptop.  yeah it is an hp.  so far i'm extremely happy  with it, i still have to get it hooked up to the internet.  contrary to what  most people believe it is not that cheap to buy technology here.   i mean  you can but you have to sacrifice things that are now standard on my things  at home.   anyway... yeah!  i have a new toy.  last night i watched crouching tiger hidden dragon on it to check out the  quality of the screen and it was awesome.  i'd forgotten how much i like  that movie.  if anyone hasn't seen it i highly reccomend it.  anyway... i'm at the school right now.  i have to do some work they just now  told me i was supposed to do.  the organization a st. joe is so incredibly  bad i'm not surprised by anything anymore.  well gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ MSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page Â FREE  download! http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/
