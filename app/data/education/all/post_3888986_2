Hi everyone!      This is my first blog...ever!!  I'm not quite sure how I would like to utilize this experience though.  Most of the people that know me would probably attest to the fact that I am the "keep it inside and work things out internally" type of person.  I am sometimes envious of the people who can just get it out there and talk about shit.  It takes some coaxing with me I guess...I have had 23 years of practice being internal, but I've been trying for a while to create new communication practices.  When I was younger I tried to keep diaries and journals.  Yeah...those never lasted.  I tried recently to keep up with a journal of sorts, but I could never to commit to it.  I'll try hard to keep up with this blog...I really love the idea of it.  I love to hear peoples stories and maybe I'll post some of my own.  For now I think I'll stick with random thoughts, freak-outs about my body, my lethargic attitudes towards exercise, some favorite poems and maybe some of my own.     Until next time...take care  Jenna
