Today I woke up a little late. Feeling at least good but still coughing randomly. I think the vicissitude of my attitude depends mainly on how I slept and woke up (if not in the wrong side of the bed). But I feel so weird today, there is a feeling of anxiety, of remembering the past,what is in the present and what will be. I think I am becoming overtly reflective..I am practically looking at myself as if I am some kind of unknown specie- not homo sapiens though!Isn't it weird?! with all the feelings and anxiety of living and loving,I began to realize that this is what it is meant to be... I love!
