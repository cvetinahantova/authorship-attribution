Political people love to party and while security will be in full swing so will the prostitutes.    "Every convention brings in more people, and women fly in from all over the country to work it," said Robyn Few, a prostitute on probation who runs the Sex Workers Outreach Project, an advocacy group.   "There will be girls from California and from the South in Boston this week," she said. "I hope a lot of women make a lot of money and make a lot of men really happy."    For weeks, escort services have plastered advertisements in magazines and on the Internet asking women to work the convention. Even local strip clubs are putting out the word that more women are needed.    "We are looking for more girls right now," said Frank Caswell, who runs the Foxy Lady club outside Boston. "Obviously, hospitality and beauty are expected and the girls must bring something that is enticing to see."    Local agencies said they charge anywhere from $200 an hour for a little company in a delegate's hotel room; rates at national agencies can be five times that much.     Okay really if you ask anyone there they will say they brought their family.  But that didn't stop Clinton from enjoying himself.  Democrats love to party. There will be hos for EVERYONE!  Just having them for company will make a tight-assed politician happy.
