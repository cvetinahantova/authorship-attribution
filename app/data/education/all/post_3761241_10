i only have a week until i'm out of here, and i really don't like the feeling. it's been such a great trip to be here, and i have a feeling of regret as i realize that i have to go back. i guess i like the serenity and peace here, the feeling that i'm not panicking, or scared of something, frustrated by the need that i have to do something. and most of all, it's so much easier here, life. the internet's fast, t.v.'s always great (oh come on, we have to be shallow SOMETIMES), and being here with relatives again and family. who could really ask for more? there' s nothing wrong at all about here, nothing. what can i ask for? i've done here what i couldn't achieve in a year, and that was to relax. stress free. least likely now to have a goddamn nervous breakdown. or so it seems.  it was only last month that school ended. only a month when i bid farewell to so many people, friends and acquaintances. a month or two i'd want to rewind and start over and do over again, because of things i regret doing.   can't look back. have to look forward.
