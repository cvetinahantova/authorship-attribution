Today is my "right hand's" birthday.  She is celebrating it with her family, as she should, but she will be back here early in the week so that we may cause trouble and do the things we generally do.    Words fail to express how much I appreciate what she does for me.  She knows all of my secrets, and instead of thinking less of me, she's always there when I need to talk.  She listens carefully to the fears and insecurities that everyone else dismisses, and will engage me in serious discussion.  She is gifted with patience, empathy and kindness--I am a much better person because she is my friend.  I remember when I first came to graduate school--I went about my usual "I'm in a new place" strategy, which involved acting rather cool and distant so that I could evaluate everyone before acting.  In retrospect, it was a childish way to behave--making people come to me and draw me out--but she did just that, dragging me along to every social event she could (even when I'd put on airs about not wanting to go).  Now I'm more open and more confident, and I wonder what I would have been had she not been so insistent back then.  I'm sure I would be less of a person.  I just hope I can be as good a friend to her as she is to me.  --Varenia
