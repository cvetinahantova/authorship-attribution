I've enjoyed the ease of blogging that I've experienced since I switched to Blogger. It's not too simple, but not too advanced either. It works, and I like it. Especially since Movable  Hype  Type has become such a pain in the neck. Along with Blogger, another thing that I've discovered is w.bloggar. It's a tool (that many of you already know about and use) that allows you to post to a blog without having to access the main interface. It would have been great to use with the previous versions of Movable Type, back when it was free and user friendly. Now, with Blogger, I can post via w.bloggar, and not have to log in to the Blogger "Dashboard" every time I want to post.  One thing, however, is that I have yet to actually  post  using w.bloggar. Sure, I've used it to type up a few entries, but I haven't used it to actually publish a post to my blog. That will be the true test of this thing, I suppose.  And now that I've bored you to death, I think I'll be moving on.  Peace, AtG
