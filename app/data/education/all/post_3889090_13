OK, where was I... Right. If it is unreasonable to think that 'not me' is confined to my observations of it, then it becomes reasonable at least to believe that there are parts of 'not me' that I am unable to perceive directly. God could be here, but I don't find any good reason for assuming that he/she/it is actually. However there remains a logical possibility that God could exist. In fact a whole number of things could exist and God could be one of them
