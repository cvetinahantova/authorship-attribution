Pete and I have taken a break from writing, mostly because all we do now is correspond to each other with new and improved band names, some better than our previous ones. Perhaps we should set up a web site selling cool, highly literate band names to hapless musicians. We could charge 1 USD for mawkish yet still reliable names, like The Cutters, Bristol City, or Quick Kick; then up the ante to as much as 20 USD for supercharged and brand-ready names, like The Drop Shadows, Screwtape, and The Away Jerseys. We'd keep the middle-of-the-road-names, still guaranteed to pique the curiousity of hipsters but not promise them anything, hovering around 10 USD, names like Stately Plump and Shipwreck. Pete and I would make a killing. It's a buyer's market.   I should give a link. Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings (his fan moniker "KenJen") has only two more days to go before Jeopardy shuts down for the season, and the show's producers have to decide to bring him back as a returning champ next season, since he hasn't been beaten yet. He's won like 34 days in a row, and has been basically untouchable. I caught one episode where he closed out three straight categories. Plus, he's Mormon. There have been many responses to KenJen's wrath, but i like  urlLink the drinking games .
