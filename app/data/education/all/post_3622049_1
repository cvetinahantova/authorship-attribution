I'm dead tired.  I had to be up by 5 so we can leave at 6 to work an obnoxiously long two days in Belen.  Of course I'm ready to go and no one else is.  Same old, same old.  I feel absolutely no desire to move.  I just want to crawl back in bed and sleep for a few more hours.  Days like this always remind me of basketball season where we had practice at 5:30am.  Having to roll out of bed, eat breakfast, and drive into town, all for the fun and joy of running suicides and shooting hoops.  I am to tired to write anymore.
