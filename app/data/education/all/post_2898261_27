Listening to: Dream on - Aerosmith Mood: Perplexed    It sometimes confuses me how people can be so shallow! They're ability to cause confusion and hurt astounds me, but then they're ability to cover up is beyond words!  Anyway, this week has so far been a little on the stressful side what with the kids' shows and the money/work situation so this weekend I intend to grab hold of my ADMV and not let go as he's the only one who manages to keep me sane in all of this mess!   And now it's time to fly.  HASTA
