This song is stuck in my head. Shinedown- 45  Send away for a priceless gift One not subtle, one not on the list Send away for a perfect world One not simply, so absurd In these times of doing what you're told You keep these feelings, no one knows What ever happened to the young man's heart Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart  And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45, Swimming through the ashes of another life No real reason to accept the way things have changed Staring down the barrel of a 45  Send a message to the unborn child Keep your eyes open for a while In a box high up on the shelf, left for you, no one else  There's a piece of a puzzle known as life Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight  What ever happened to the young man's heart Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart  CHORUS  Everyone's pointing their fingers Always condemning me And nobody knows what I believe I believe  CHORUS  _ Loves Sheila
