Other stuff on my mind!!!    Â  Ayee...so School is finally done and I have about 2 weeks to myself (well now 1 week left), before I start teaching again. In these 2 weeks I have been calling places left and right in West Lafayette, trying to find a place to stay for fall. I have found some areas, but obviously not enough to warrant a drive over there to check them out. I just need to have a place, and it's bugging me up the wall!!!!!! I can't imagine not having a place :((  Then there's the issue about having a car. I have been looking for cars forever!!!! I have the money, just need to sit down and really just find the one I want and then I need someone to go with me to buy the car! I hope to get this car issue resolved in the next 2 weeks so I have a car to drive with...to school!!!   And finding the roommate..would be my first priority..and I sure hope it works out! Please pray for me!!!!!!!!!!! :(
