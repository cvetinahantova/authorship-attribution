There's an ill wind blowing in Bethnal Green. Quite literally. I know cos it just nearly blew me off of my feet on the way to the postbox. It nicely parallels the mood of this week, though. The times they are a changin'...   I'm hanging on the event horizon of the big black hole that is the end of the course. My brain seems to have gone into total lockdown. For three days now my standards folder has sat unopened on my desk, beaming out bad vibes like a thing posessed. If I ever do get it together to open the thing up, I'm pretty sure I'll see the fire of damnation burning in a distant dimension and hear the voice of a thousand unearthly spirits hissing the word 'Zoooouuulll'. In our kitchen, the manky eggs that have been sat on the counter for the last month will spontaneously jump out of their box and fry on the worktop, and since Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd live in Hollywood and are getting a bit long in the tooth for crossing the streams, not a soul on earth will be able to save me.  From somewhere, somehow, I have to summon the will for one last push for the finish line.   I'm a bit tired.  Maybe tomorrow.
