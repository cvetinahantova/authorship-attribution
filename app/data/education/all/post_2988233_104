I can't believe I haven't posted about "The Apprentice" yet...Let me start by saying, I am not a fan of Trump, in no way shape or form.  But, I am addicted to this show.  Worse than American Idol.  and this week, with Troy getting fired, I have no one to root for anymore.  I LOVE Troy.  He was so funny and swwet on Leno tonight.  Made me say AWWWWWW when he was talking about his sister.  BLess his heart.  I wanted him to win sooooooo bad.  I think he did get fired because of his lack of a degree.  But he made up for it in savvy.  Now, who to root for? Probably Quami or Bill.  I used to like NIck and Amy both until they got so ga-ga, and I really think Amy is using NIck's attraction to her to keep him tied in knots.  So she can win.    Ok, with that out of my system, it is time for bed.
