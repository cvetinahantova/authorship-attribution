I just spoke to the vocational ed. teacher. He said that he needs to close up the shop because the people who built the place did not meet the fire codes necessary for such activity. The problem is that we are knee deep in wood projects. The retrofitting of the shop class would probably cost around 5 to 10 thousand dollars. That sounds like a lot, but it is truely a drop in the bucket compared to the money brought in to the agency by the educating of the clients. Sometimes I wonder if the folks who began this organization have lost track of their original dreams, goals, ideals, and mission. The child centered approach is being lost in the financial grind.  I brought in a large box of books that I had been saving from when I taught 7 years ago. Most of it is low level math and reading stuff. I guess I am doing this for two reasons. One, the school is very limited in its resources and curriculum is low priority for the admin. ( money ) Two, I am probably deciding that I will not be teaching in the future. Don't know.
