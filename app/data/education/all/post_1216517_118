Johnny Appleseed is now an alcoholic.  He smokes like a friend too.  He's been trying to quit for a while though.  Johnny, ever concerned with the length of this toenails, always keeps a set of pedicure supplies on hand.  With the rounded sissors, he clips each ciggarette in two to help curb his habit. The unsmoked halves are placed in a ziploc bag which he keeps under the front seat of his '75 olds cutlass supreme.  Johnny goes downtown on Saturdays and passes out the smokes to the homeless, out a sense of civil duty that he still clings to.   my dream vacation  hitchhike from L.A. down through central and south america to the tip of argentina and take a nap at tierra del fuego. catch a boat to antarctica, shoot a penguin and have a penguinburger. Then copyright that meal and whoop Mcd's hiney with my new fastfood franchise, Arctic Jim's Jumbo Burgers, which will also feature polar bear, elephant seal, and whale meat.
