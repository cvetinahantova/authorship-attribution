My first post in more than a year... I just remembered that I've had a blog acct for quite some time now. Time to put my rusty writing skills (not that there was much skill to begin with) back into use...     Now for my random, non-sensical, utterly useless thought for the day  ( disclaimer: "thought for the day" does not really mean I'll post one everyday (yay!), it just sounds better that way)     I can't believe it, it's barely 9 pm and already my eyelids feel heavier than a... heavy... thingamajig (yep..  rusty, rusty, rusty). All thanks to my wonderful new 6-6 work day.  Ahh.. the joys of leaving the comfort of your bed at 4 am, of never seeing the light of day, it's absolutely incredible (yes, i'm being sarcastic)      It's my first day of workin a 12- hour shift and already I'm complaining, I imagine I'll be quite the annoying little whiner after a month of this horrible working schedule... I try thinking of the money I'll be getting from all this overtime, but with the sched like this, I doubt I'll ever be able to use it (and for those opportunistic readers, giving freebies is not an option for me to be able to use the money). I wonder if it's really worth it... it's not like I have a family to support.. and with this sched, I doubt I'll even be able to start a family...    ...hmm, I think I originally planned on all this having a point, but my brain is startin to shut down, I'd better stop now else my mom might find me slumped over the keyboard with a pool of drool forming on the table...     ...and with that delightful image, i'll say.. good night!
