I always hear "nothing's final until the closing" when people are buying a house.  Well, now I know the true meaning of that phrase.  I am buying a house.  So far, everything has gone smoothly.  Extremely smoothly.  Until today.  And closing is set for 2:30 tomorrow. The homeowners found out today they have a lean on their house for $7,500 that they weren't aware of.  All leans are required to be paid off before a house can be sold.  So if closing is to proceed, they have to come up with that money and pay it to the city of Mason by tomorrow.  Actually their real estate agent has agreed to pay $3,500 hundred of that because it is her fault that they weren't aware of this.  So they just need the rest of the money. The only other option the homeowners have (besides paying the money) is to relist the house for that much more.  Even though I feel upset about it, I feel even worse for the homeowners going through this.  They have already moved out of their house, which means they are probably paying rent in some apartment.  And they are buying a house in Connecticut - probably a difficult process since they live here.  And then this comes up.  I just have to remember that if we are meant to be here then we will be.  We are finding out tomorrow morning what's going on.  I'll keep you posted, and if we do end up getting it I'll post pictures of the house. Until then...I'll be waiting and living out of the boxes that are already packed
