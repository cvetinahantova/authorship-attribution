Well, I haven't had a very eventful life these last few days, so there really hasn't really been much to write about.  Hence some non-posting days.  We went swimming yesterday, and she had so much fun!  We have some unexpected visitors in town (technically, they're not our visitors because they're not at our house, but they're our family, so that counts) and we were invited to join them at my uncle's house last night.  We were there late, as usual, and I had to get up this morning to take AbbieDabbie to the dentist.  I did alright with having to get up, but she didn't.  It took a while to get her to wake up and stop trying to lay down and go back to sleep.  Nothing super-eventful happened while we were swimming...only that Abbie lost an earplug, so we had to get her out of the water and then try to look for it.  It wasn't found last night, but I think they were going to look this morning.  I'd hate for it to gum up the pump and stuff...That would be the worst.  Dentist today went well, no cavities or anything.  Don't need to go back for 6 months, so we're good to go.  She has a doctor's appointment Friday, so I will let you know how that goes.
