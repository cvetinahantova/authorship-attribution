While the only truly pro-peace candidate is Dennis Kicinich (sp?), I still am intrigued by Dean.    I think the media attempt to reinforce Bush by harping on his "support" in the polls and constantly repeating how the democrats have no coherent message is really missing reality.  I think if you listen to the democrats the constant theme of no more bush or as Al Sharpton says "lets get out of the bushes" will ring true.  The toll of 9 candidates saying why Bush is wrong for months on end will have an effect.  The appeal of Bush's campaign of fear will wear off.
