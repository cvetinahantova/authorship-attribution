Listened to the new Blur album in a record shop today.  It's very very good!  The first track is a bit of an anthem with the lyrics:             " I aint got, nothing to be scared of, cos I love you"  over and over again, in the words of Neo, "Whoah".  Hooked to  urlLink The Ark  on  urlLink Ship of Fools .  It's a 40 day reality game-show where biblical characters live on Noah's Ark.  Very funny, but also a great re-imagining and re-telling of Bible stories.  Love it.
