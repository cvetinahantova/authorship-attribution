I viewed another couple of cars on the way into work this morning. One was supposed to be a private sale, but when I got there it turned out to be a scrap dealer with 6 cars for sale - all insurance write-offs. I'm going to look at another at lunch with Sandra. She's off today and has just had her haircut, it sounds really nice - the first time she has been happy with it for a long, long time. She asked to meet me at lunch, so I presume she want to show it off.
