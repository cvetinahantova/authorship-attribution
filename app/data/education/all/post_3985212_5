Well folks, my floor joists are supporting 2.4 pounds less than they were last week at this time! Woo hoo for another 2.4 pounds lost this week. I gotta tell you, I feel great and I'm starting to look better too! I'm fitting into those size 14 jeans again (bye bye size 16 and 18).   I have a couple of motivational sayings relating to weight loss today:  "Never give up what you want most (to be thin) for what you want at the moment (that huge piece of chocolate cake, perhaps?)."  "Being thin feels better than  (insert name of fattening food that you're craving here)  tastes."  Remember, if I can do it, so can you! So get out there, exercise, eat right, and feel better!
