Tried out the new razor, not sure it is worth 8 bucks.  Seriously, I don't feel like I got a close enough shave.  I did like the stuff it left on my skin afterwards though.  Felt much better than the usual prickly feeling I get after shaving.  I have accomplished absolutely nothing today, nada, zero, zilch.    It rained last night, all night, we slept with the windows open so we could hear.  It was one of those steady, rains, not to hard, not to soft, just enough to make you sleepy.  I love spring rains like that.  They are so refreshing and renewing.  Especially after dark.  I love rain after sunset.  I wish I had a porch to sit on and just take in all the sounds and smells that come with a spring rain.
