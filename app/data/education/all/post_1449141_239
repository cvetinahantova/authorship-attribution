urlLink Economist.com | Occupying Iraq   FLAMES belch out of the desert in northern Iraq where, on July 31st, an unidentified saboteur placed an explosive device under a buried fuel pipeline leading to a local distribution station. Five days later, an American civilian contractor working at the local refinery was killed when his truck drove over an anti-tank mine. The blasts, coming shortly before crude oil is to begin flowing from the Bayji terminus to Turkey, suggest that the 150,000 American troops in the country cannot fully protect either themselves or Iraq's infrastructure from low-level insurgency�and that oil exports are unlikely to cover the costs of getting Iraq back on its feet.  The day before the pipeline attack, Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) running Iraq, announced that he hoped to be going home within a year. It was not �unreasonable�, he said, that elections for a sovereign Iraqi government could be held by mid-2004. The occupation is a drain on American blood and treasure, and the occupiers may be looking for an exit strategy, perhaps before George Bush must stand for re-election.
