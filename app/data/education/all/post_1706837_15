hey everybody, ive done lots in the past few days! [hello to everyone who posted comments so far... sorry i didnt get to see you Erin, Chantelle, and Chris... youll just have to come back after august 6... im sure ill see ya at the big ole renfrew fair tho!!]  we didnt do a whole lot wednesday night or thursday... yesterday we were going to go to the plains of abraham [as a group] but it rained all day, so we went to a big mall instead... it was kind of like a little West Edmonton Mall... we went on a rollercoaster LOL. i bought a new orange plaid shirt... its nice [and it wasnt very expensive! :)] and for 25 bucks i got 2 CDs [Sam Roberts and Three Days Grace]  this morning at 6:58 [on my clock, it was actually 7] we had a practice fire drill, which woke me up 2 minutes early :(.... i was ready though because they said it would be this week, and its then end of the week, so i knew it would be today.... sucks to be the people that were in the shower at the time! HAHAHA  class was boring today as usual... but soon we will be going to eat lunch and then we are going to Vieux Quebec... the Quebec Summer Festival is from 8th-18th, so we will probably go to that... we are also gonna go see Farenheit 911 [in english... yesterday in our workshop we watched some Mary-Kate and Ashley show in french, and it was almost impossible to understand! LOL.. i dont remember if i talked about the workshop yet or not, but me and Jodie are doing the album, which turned out to be the yearbook that everyone gets at the end... its fun, and we are doing the pages for les animateurs, which is fun.  anyway, thats all for today... au revoir!
