I'm definitely getting somewhere. It's odd, really, to see which characters I have the easiest time analyzing... I've already finished all of Jack's quotes, and I'm almost done with Roger, whereas I've only got a couple for Ralph and Simon, and none for Piggy. I would have thought that I'd finish Ralph first, and then Jack... and I thought Roger would be the hardest one, especially since I hated his character.  Meh, whatever.
