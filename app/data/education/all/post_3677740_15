Congrats, you're Mystique! ...Or is that just another one of you tricks? No one really knows with you, because you change your identity so often! You're actually a very tragic character, but no one cares because you're a violent, coniving bitch. Your shape-shifting powers make you the perfect spy and assassin, but despite your awesome powers and fighting skills, you're stuck at home baby-sitting the Brotherhood. No one seems to appriciate you, either. Many people hate you, but that's okay, because you hate them right back. Stop being angry and spend some time alone with the real "you"- not just another shape.    urlLink   *~*Which X-Men Evolution Villain Are You?*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla         I AM 52% PUNK ROCK!
