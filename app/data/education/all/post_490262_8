This morning driving to work, it was so beautiful out!  The sun was just coming up and there was this pinkish glow.  The mountain (Mt. Rainier for those of you who don't live in the Seattle area) was out (meaning there were no clouds) and it was covered in snow.  The shadows were lavender and there was frost on the ground.  It was the kind of morning that tricks Californians into moving here.
