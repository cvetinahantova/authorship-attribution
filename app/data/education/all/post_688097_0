Im currently updating my site. And almost doing nothing else, By the way, my url is http://jcbylon.tripod.com, take a look at it if you have the time. Today my dad and I went swimming and tennis. We were only biking to the swimming pool (resort). then my dad decided to use my other bike to have them fixed. We are also planning to go scuba diving tomorrow in Batangas, that will be my first check-out (term for scuba dive out in the sea). My first day of school in Manila will be on Monday, thats in the Philippine Christian University, im quite nervous.
