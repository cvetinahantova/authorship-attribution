Ok, so I survived  Day 1 .  Plenty of tears and tons of sighs later, we arrive at  Day 2 .  Jonathan should either be in Illinois, or on his way... I'm figuring he's already there, since it's the second  full  day he's been gone.  I think even Zoey misses him, which is sad.  I realized last night, during the sermon from Dr. Loe (sp?) ... well he brought a movie with Kirk Cameron doing a sermon, but whatever ... I was staring off into space, thinking about him, wondering where he was and what he was doing.  I know my family is doing it, too.  I know his family has got to be doing it a lot more often than we are.  But for some reason I still feel alone with this burden.  I had a dream with him in it last night.  I don't remember what it was about, I just remember he was in it and he played a major role. It'll be the third night of VBS tonight, I hope there's something interesting to tape tonight, last night was pretty boring but I think Caitlin still managed to tape over 6 minutes of Sunday night's VBS.  If she did, I will be irritated, but I hope it just didn't record... or that I was reading the timer wrong... either way, I switched out the tapes. I'm tired though, I stayed up last night and did some Bible study.  I finished off Judges and read Ruth and today I start on 1 Samuel.  I'm going to go play  Ratchet and Clank  for a little while.  More later!
