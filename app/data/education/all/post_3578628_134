ok well i know im crazy... and once i say something a couple of days later i could mean something completely different. But i dont think you should publicly attack josh... b/c he is not a public person. asÂ  long as i have known him he is neutral about everything and doesnt care about things that dont have an absolute importance to him. so in your words kev... keep this stuff to ims and telephone calls. i am interested in how this thing turns out with u two.. b/c i care about u both.. but i dont think this is how josh will respond to it well... and i know you know that as well.
