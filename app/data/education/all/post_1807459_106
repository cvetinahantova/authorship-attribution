Turns out free beer was enough to get most of us out last night.  By most of us I mean Fenton, Caleb and myself.  Miller time was totally packed.  I've never seen it like that before.  The beer was a little funny and possibly watered down but good none the less.  I think a good time was had by all.  We then went to Exodus so Fenton could say hello to his better half.  Here we were harrassed by and equally drunk bartender who was really hot.  In theory I met her before at AU but that's all a little blurry.  For Caleb and I was onto AU.  This place is the coolest ever.  Why?  Because they have a monkey.  Yes a real live monkey.  It is a one year old African monkey that the bartender carries around with her and lets the customers play with him.  Asma you're really missing out.  On Saturday he ate part of Andreas cake.  So here we made broken English conversation with one of the bartenders.  She confessed to being a playgirl.  Caleb also gave them their first opportunity to make a kamakazi.
