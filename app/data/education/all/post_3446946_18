This week has just been crazy. The new  urlLink Hillel  building is complete and this is one big celebration weekend. Thursday night, I helped represent  urlLink Jconnect  at the Leadership Donors Building Opening Celebration. It was amazing. First off, these donors all gave over $10,000 to the new building and all, as you can imagine, have a very strong commitment to Hillel at the UW. The best part for me, was towards the beginning. I was asked to uncover the glass panels which bear the names of said leadership donors. Forget my action. It was the time, when I’m standing at one end of the large, central gallery, with 250 people looking in my direction, in anticipation. Some smiling, some serious, some tired, all with a sparkle in their eyes. People packed into the first floor, flowing up the stairs, wrapping around and hanging over the railing to get a look at the brief ceremony. And it’s not that I’m so important, it’s that I’m, at this moment, at the physical center of these people’s love and attention. For a brief moment, I witness how much these people care about the same organization that I care so much about. All I could do was smile.
