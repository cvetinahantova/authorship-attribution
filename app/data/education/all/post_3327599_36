Check it out.. John's still in bed haha.   I'm gettin' kinda bored with the whole sleeping on the floor thing in Morris.. I had a weird dream last night. It was about Brandon and Chris and i don't really want to get into it but it's buggin' me.. Anywho! I'm starting to miss school. I'll change my tune in about 3 months but that's ok. I start work soon so maybe that will help with the summertime blues. well i'm off for a little more southern comfort and i mean that in more then one way..  Oh! I failed to mention the lady i talked to last friday offered me the babysitting job for her 2 little girls. It's a 7 and 5 yr old. Those are weird ages but i'm sure i can handle them! Alrighty then i'm done for real this time..
