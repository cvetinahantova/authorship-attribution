In the past year or two I've seen Flash turn from a rather neat browser plugin to a horrifying plague. If it wasn't because jewels such as Strong Bad's E-mail are in Flash I would have dumped it quite a while ago. I specially hate those Flash ads that use sound - it's not only disruptive, but the sound is generally crappy too. Fortunately Mozilla (Firefox) has the Adblock plugin, which is a blessing, because it lets me specifically block flash ads. I've come to the point of considering to even starting to allow image-based ads again just so they'll fucking stop the flash ones. Well, as long as they're not the blinking, seizure-inducing type.
