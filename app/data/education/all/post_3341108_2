today as usual but something happened that maybe someday will change everything...chatted with someone whom i know for a very long time..she's very attractive..but the important thing is..why it sound different this time?..and i mean very-very different..she seemed to be a bit (maybe a lot) brave than before..asking me wild and open questions..as if..she has the idea tht i'm admiring her all the time..it is undeniable tht i may have a crush on her before..but now..i don't know..even though i have my own princess..GOD! HELP ME!! I don't wanna hurt one of them but at the same time i MAY have the same feelin' on both of them..MAN!! what's happening to me?? The worse thing is..she wants to follow me to u.k when i'm furthering my studies..living with me for at least 5 years..hey..wht's happening to this world? has it turned upside down? does she has other meaning behind her words just now?? I DON'T KNOW!   National level basketball competition is next week.. Practice? Just as usual..informal because my coach is not around.. Can't wait for it to end as soon as possible..will be damn tired after that..maybe have to cancel my plan to apply for the driving license.. but i dunno..it depends on situation..
