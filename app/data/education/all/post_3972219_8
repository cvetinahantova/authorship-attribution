Uncle George loved me unconditionally and I will always be thankful for the encouragement that he gave me, He made me feel valued and special. As a child I admired him because he knew so much about everything. As a young adult, the time I spent with him helped me to grow and mature. I remember him asking me if I thought Jackie was too young for him, and I said no, because I knew he already loved her.I am so blessed to have had him for my Uncle. Tina
