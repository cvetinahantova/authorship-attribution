today was fine and stuff, had my flute lesson, had youth meetin, my usual boring morning...etcetcetc...just gonna speak a bit about how different it was today...  since my cousins stayed over last night, it was fun to see them again in the morning, since two nights ago they stayed around too, after goin to carrefour when it was nearly closing and stuff...then going to the suspension bridge at kallang indoor stadium...  anyway, despite staying up until 2 am last night, i woke up at 8 something...coz my room was too cold! i finished the book on  anne boleyn ,  king henry viii 's 2nd wife...so u see, i have quite a big interest in english history...believe me, king henry viii had 6 wives! they are named: 1. Catherine of Aragon 2. Anne Boleyn 3. Jane Seymour 4. Anne of Cleves 5. Catherine Howard 6. Catherine Parre thats really a shameless man, and plus he had many mistresses to have fun with! some kind of king...  i hope u enjoyed yesterday's poem....dont have one now...too lazy to type it out and my parents hate me sleeping out late...yeah...  saw enoch, alison and zhen qing in the youth meeting today after some time...teck yuke hitched a ride in my dad's car as well...and almost everyone shared a bit in the meeting, except for me, chatting up with enoch and daniel goh outside...and them lor...yong kwang came late with samuel...that was really funny...  had dinner with aunt nancy, cousins and family at food village at east coast....it was so packed we took ages to find a parking lot... but we had good food...initially we wanted to go to visit the sand sculpture contest...but when we finished dinner, there were crushed structures made by mischievious kids...aw man...wind then was cool and really nice...loved the sea all over again...wanted to sit by the stone cliff and contemplate on life, but had to go home...haha  i need to sleep now...ive decided to join friendster whenever the time permits me...so see ya soon!
