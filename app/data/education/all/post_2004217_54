The typical has happened. I'm thinking about Sean. 2 days of over analysing his behaviour at Home Grown and telling myself I don't fancy him has made me start *thinking*. Waiting for texts. Going online to see if he's online; Going offline if he's not. And I don't fancy him! I know I don't, it's just that I don't fancy anyone else at the moment and he was so nice to me on Tuesday... argh I'm so useless! All they have to do is *lean* and *hug* and tell me I look great and I turn into a big mushy pile of soppy goo on the floor. He probably doesn't even fancy me, he didn't before and I haven't changed, personality-wise, so it's not like suddenly he's decided to fancy me. Or have I changed? Is it something to do with me looking considerably better than I did a year ago (albeit still nothing very special)?  Ceff x   And I wonder if I'm alone in your head...
