It's hard to find true friends in this world. People that care, people that make you laugh even under the worst possible situations that come out to be hte best. Someone who doesn't backstab, someone who you TRUST won't don that. You'd feel lonely at times, and you've gotta talk to them, and even if they've got things to do, THEY'LL take the time to talk. They'll let you know that, hey, you're NOT ALONE.  They're also the ones that'll bring you back to your senses if you do somehting stupid no matter how much it hurts to bring that one person back to reality. On more than one occasion taht's happened to me: Stuart, who nearly had to slap me out of it when I've gone completely lovestruck on more than one occasion. colva, who lemed me realize that, hey, if something happens it happens, and there's no fit of rage that will make it go away. Adam who helped me constantly look at the reality of things. Jared who I've shared moments of arguments and philosophy. Josh who I constantly fought with who showed me that, hey, sooner of later we're gonna find that I'm going to have to see the brighter side of things. Alex who showed me how to lay back and relax. CHILL. And Will, even after years, always looked out for me.  And sooner or later, you've got to say thank-you's. I decided to say mine today.
