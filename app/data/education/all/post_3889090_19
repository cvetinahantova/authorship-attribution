So my goal is maximum happiness. How do I achieve that? Well, that's a good question asked by almost every soul since the beginning of time, I would imagine. This I don't know. This is a question about 'me' which I am unable to answer at the moment. However my goal must be to answer this question. How can I do this? How can I know what will bring me ultimate happiness? Well I can partly know the answer to this question from experience, but that is not enough as it is a hit and miss thing that I might not hit. I could ask other people, but that assumes that they are the same as me and will find happiness in the same things I will. This doesn't seem to be a reasonable assumption at this point in time. OK, so this is the moment when I bring God into the picture...
