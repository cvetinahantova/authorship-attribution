Today was going so well.  I didn't oversleep.  I hit no traffic on the way to work.  The weather was beautiful.  AND THEN...as I'm getting off the LIE at exit 49 S, it happens.  I roll into a minivan.  BAM!  Just like that, I have become a statistic.  I've never gotten into an accident before.  The woman who was driving the minivan was stupid.  She didn't roll down the window to talk to me.  She just sat there and talked on her cell phone and CB radio, even though I was standing in front of her and waving for her to roll down the goddamn window.  CB radio??? That's odd, thought I.  I thought she might be some kind of work carpool service, because she had 3 non-related looking people in the van.  Then I notice it - little writing on the side of the minivan - Helpers Assisting the Mentally Retarded.  YEP, you guessed it!  I hit a bunch of retarded people.  LOVELY, the day is just getting better.  So, she calls the cops, because its protocol, even though this is just a stupid little fender-bender, and my car was absolutely fine.  Apparently, after waiting an hour, she realizes that she told the cops the wrong intersection.  Ooops. The cops finally find us, maybe they were looking for the retarded people by the side of the road, I don't know how they did it.  And then she decides to try to find her driver's license and registration - as if she didn't just have an hour to look for it.  STUPID - what the hell did she think the cops were coming for, to play chess????  UGH.  So the cops get the info, we all make sworn statements, blah blah blah.  I get to work and apparently more than a few of my coworkers saw me on the side of the road, so they all teased me about being against retarded people.    I need to go to bed.
