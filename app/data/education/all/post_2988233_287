The drama that is my life.    While at work today, Tommy read my blog and saw a comment that was made, and he took it to be a proposition.  The first tiem I read it, I thought it was jsut and innocent statement.  After re-reading it I saw that is crossed the line.    Tommy and I have talked about it.  And many other things, and we are ok now.  It's been an emotional night.  But we cleared the air about alot of things.  Including what caused me to get so messed up with the finances and stuff.  It has been a very productive night.    We both re-iterated the fact that we  love each other so much, that in almsot 16 years of marriage all of them have been good until the past 6 months. Depression is a serious thing.  It can make normal well grounded people make dumb decisions.  That is what I fell prey to.  Making dumb decisions.  Especially where money was concerned.  Or rather a lack of money.    But I have to say, it has been a good night.  We both know where the other stands and where the each other has been coming from for a long time.   It made us think, talk and open up.   My husband loves me just as I am, and I love him, just as he is.  Whew, that's a relief.
