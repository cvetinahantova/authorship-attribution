Hmmmm today was....RAINY. It was so nasty outside. It was terrible! I had my hair down since we were having team pictures this afternoon, but I gave up. My hair was starting to curl in the humidity and downpour.   Angriscience was really boring.  In Team Sports I played HORSE with Matt, Scuzzy, Teddy, Courtney, and Sarah.  In Government I had a funny debate with other classmates about conservatives and liberals and the homework we had. Hahahaha. *rollseyes*  I ate lunch with Amanda and Keesha.  After lunch, I saw Kendra and Pepe and Ryan. I told Kendra about second place and I was happy again. Man, I know this sounds really boring, doesn't it? I need something exciting to happen, but I know if I ask for something to happen it won't be good...  English was incredibly boring. The class is full of MORONS. I think it's everyone but me and Amanda and Amber...  Team Pictures took FOREVER. Now I have to go to Tae Kwon Do and I'm exhausted. Grrrrrr!!!!   Watching buttercups cup the light                        Sleeping on a dandelion Too much, I wouldn't touch you                        But then I might...  --Pink Floyd ------   Later...    AHHHH!!! The class was full of dudes! Usually Cathrine goes...or Krista...I was the only girl and I was the youngest and I was the SHORTEST!!!!! AHHH!!! This one boy kept farting...ewwwww....  Now I'm very tired, but I can't sleep. It's so psycho and strange...whoa...:-)
