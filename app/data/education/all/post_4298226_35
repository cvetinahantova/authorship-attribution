I’m trying to understand  what I’m feeling inside Even I’m a stranger to my own feeling  I’m shedding tears But I don’t know why  I’m laughing But the laugh is so bitter  I know that it’s supposed to be And something that’s not meant to But I keep denying Telling myself nothing’s wrong Except it’s not  It’s so wrong That I begin to have doubt on me And blaming myself  Sometimes I just wanna go away Far away… Pretend I’m just a stranger
