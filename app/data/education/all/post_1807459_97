I think I might have been dumped by my girlfriend but I'm not quite sure.  I haven't talked to her in 2 days so that leads me to believe there is something wrong.  She hung out with a guy "friend" on Sunday night.  Which, that's cool I'm a trusting individual.  I asked her to call me when she got home.  Well I'm still waiting for her to call.  Maybe she ran off with him.  Beats me.  Either way I'm not going to call or sweat it.  I think it might be a silly Korean game where I'm supposed to call her or something.  Whatever, I'm too old for games.  She said she'd call so she should call.  If she doesn't want to then oh well.  I hope it isn't something serious though like she's in the hospital or something.  Then I'd feel like an ass.  But the chances of that are so slim I don't think that's a real possibility.  We'll see.   Last night was fun.  There was dinner at WABA and then socializing at Bellagio.  We even got a free side dish b/c we ordered 3 cocktails.  It wasn't a particularly late night so that was good.  I'll explain the reson for going out last night tomorrow or Friday, for reasons I'll explian then as well.  I think I'm going to go shopping tomorrow during the day.  I'm itching to get some new clothes.  I'm tired as of late.  I need to sleep better.  Spring where are you?  Hurry up and get here.
