Why Don't You Tell Me How You Really Feel   I need a good book to read.  I ordered Richard Matheson's " urlLink I am Legend  " this weekend, but I am impatient.  I was thinking of starting a "What is the Jones Reading?" link to a list on amazon, but really.  Who cares what I'm reading?  I'd rather know what you all are reading, what you think of it and why you think I should read it.  That might be just as self-important, but it’s a little less pretentious.     Some of you know my tastes better than others.  I like my stakes to be cosmic.  I'm less impressed by impressive-minded writing than I am by impressive content.  That said, notably bad writing trumps notably interesting content.  I‘m obsessed with death, glory and melancholia.    Scott is obsessed with apes.  I'm not being cute, either.  If you know of any great books about apes, I'm sure he would be grateful to hear about them.
