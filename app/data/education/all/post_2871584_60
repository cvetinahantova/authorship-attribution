Today was a day of... I don't know what.    It started off normally enough.  I went out and ran some errands, including buying a new pair of glasses.  Ouch to my bank account on that one, but it was one of those necessary evils, particularly with the way that my allergies have been acting up lately.  My contacts don't feel so great when my eyes are red, watery, and itching before I even put them in.  Hopefully, having new glasses will help that situation.  When I got home, I ended up on the phone most of the night.  Doreen and I ended up talking for an hour and a half, and I got filled in on all of the amusing Jersey gossip.  Good to know that some things never change.  Then Sarah called, and we talked for over an hour.  She had all sorts of exciting news to share.  She and a friend of hers are renting a townhouse next semester.  Just the two of them, renting a townhouse.  I am actually kind of blown away.  My baby sister is going to be living a bigger place than I am--and she hasn't even graduated college yet!  lol.  She also had some nice interesting information to share with me that managed to get me completely pissed off at my father.  Granted, that's not all that hard to do, but this one was right up there in the top five times I've been pissed off at him, and THAT is quite the accomplishment.  I was also beyond livid that it was my sister who had to tell me this information, putting her in the middle of the situation that she had no part of, and yet got pulled in to.  God, he pisses me off!!!  The good news is, tomorrow is the Boilermaker, and so Kris is in town for the weekend.  She's running tomorrow morning, and then we're going to spend the day together.  I haven't seen her since I stopped at her place on the way down to New Orleans in February, so it will be nice to have an afternoon to catch up.
