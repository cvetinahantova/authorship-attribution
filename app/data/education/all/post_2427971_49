had my 17th birthday this weekend, 17 years old on the 17th day of april. Apparently its special er something... everyone asks me if i feel different, i dont like always. finally got excited for it when nate got here, it was defiantly great to see him. kat came over, we played games and hung out, she left sometime at night or somethin. we stayed up til about 3 and were woken up by kat around 930, she gave me my bday presents and i slowly woke up. so yeah, the bday was fun... first people to be here were, not counting nat, kat and i, were adrian and jen... so yeah, everyone got here and we pretty much chilled, it was nice... i didnt want anything too big er anything. i stayed up til 3 again, adrian had to stay the night cause he thought thats what was goin on, im glad he did. watching him play games was a good background to whatever i was doing. nate was playin with fruity loops, dont know what he was doing... but he was doing it with his eyes closed. the night was over and we woke up again around 930, but without any help... didnt expect that, anyways... adrian went home and kat came back, shed left her comp here for the night, and we played more games and stuff... so nate went to retrieve zak, then zak was here. nate left for Washington around 2, zak went to a play... im finished writing about that... dont feel like it, that was about it. just felt like shit all day, when people started coming over this morning i just broke and didnt want anyone here. so i played sacred and focused my concentration on something else than the ones behind me. it was decently fun, kept me occupied. everyone is gone now, relieving. dont know whats goin on for the rest of the year, nothing would be good though.
