Ok. Once your profile is finished, go back to the dashboard.  You'll see your blog there - click it, and you should immediately have your posting screen up. This is where all your posts are stored and organised - at the moment, it will say "NO POSTS FOUND". Click "create post" and you're ready to go.   OTHER THINGS:  You have four tabs to work with here: posting, settings, template, and view blog. We'll look at these in more detail later, but basically...  -POSTING is where all your writing happens and is stored -TEMPLATE gives you access to the HTML code -VIEW BLOG lets you preview what the blog will look like when you post  SETTINGS is the tricky one. Explore it in your own time, but remember - if you don't understand it, you probably don't need to. (there are "?" tags attached to anything that has a help file, too).  You will need to change the date/time in formatting - we are in GMT 10. For the moment, you can ignore the "blog members" stuff.  Next up: links, comments, and site meters!
