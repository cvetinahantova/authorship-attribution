THE BEAUTY OF A WOMAN  The beauty of a woman Is not in the clothes she wears, The figure that she carries, Or the way she combs her hair.  The beauty of a woman must be seen from in her eyes, Because that is the doorway to her heart, the place where love resides.  The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mole, But true beauty in a woman Is reflected in her soul.  It is the caring that she lovingly gives, The passion that she shows, And the beauty of a woman With passing years-only grows!  You don't stop laughing because you grow old; you grow old because you stop laughing
