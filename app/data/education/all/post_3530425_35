Wow, Juan called and came over.  And it was good to see him.  I'm thinking, I may have  two  boyfriends.  I've never juggled men before -- any insights?  Or, wait, about 20 years ago, I was seeing three men:  two on weekends, and one during the week.  I had a lot more stamina then.  It looks like, in a couple of weeks, I may have Juan and David feeding me regularly.  I'll adjust my grocery budget.
