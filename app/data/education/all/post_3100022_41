I am the Human Cuckoo clock the time is now ... Because I was late twice last week, I am now the human cuckoo clock for the Walkabout Inn Reading, a decision made by the Manager(s) means that every hour on the hour during the times when I am working; I have to get the clock from downstairs in the kitchen off the wall and then stand on the ground floor bar and say "Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo, I am the human Cuckoo clock. The time is now   o'clock". Its an interesting disiplinary action which I don't have too many issues with - I find it quite enjoyable. But I do wonder about the validity of punishment by means of repeating the crime. I mean really, what I have to do is a bit of a time waister, think about it, it takes about a minute or two out of my regular work activities to get the clock and stand on the bar and say my lines. I also have to disrupt other peoples time by asking people in the kitchen to send the clock up in the food lift. Other bar staff also stop what they are dong and watch me do this thing, which is probably on average wasting about two minutes of work time every hour, probably for the next week. were to work  for 50 hours in a week, that 100 minutes where time is being wasted - almost two whole hours a week.  Oh well, cest la vie.  I'm going for an interview tomorrow for my new job too. Perfect timing!
