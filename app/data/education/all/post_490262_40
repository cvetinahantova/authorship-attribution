An old boyfriend recently emailed me completely out of the blue.  We hadn't spoken for ten years.  He's on "sabatical" for a while and decided to Google me.  We had lunch the other day and it was good to see him.  We talked about everything from reality TV (we both watch, but different shows) to musical taste (Jazz? Really?) to image consultants (he'd been to one, I haven't).  What really struck me about this meeting, for the first time in ten years, was how the same he was.  His inflections, his wording, his sense of humor were all the same.  But he was different too.  More centered, his self assurance rang more true.  Now, here's the thing--can we be friends again?  I don't know. He was  that  boyfriend for me. The one you break up with, then make up with again and again.  At one point in my life I was totally convinced I would marry this man.  He was my soul mate.  Now we're both married (to other people, obviously) and he is someone else's soulmate.  I'd like to try for friends, I really have missed him but the complications seem overwhelming.  It seems to me that married people are rarely friends with a member of the opposite sex unless it's a couples friends thing.  So, I guess we'll see.  I emailed him last, thanking him for the lunch and now it's his turn.
