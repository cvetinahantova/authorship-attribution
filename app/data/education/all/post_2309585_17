urlLink     I have the wings of the  Phoenix .   Gotta meet with the bank today. Bleh. Sat down with Dad, and figured out that it must be the bank's mistake, because we've never written a check we didn't have money to cover. Ever. Thankfully, Dad's friends with the bank pres, so he said he'll meet with us personally this afternoon.  Classes are pretty good, and I'm at least remembering people's names. I've got a list of things I have to do this weekend, if I'm going to stay on top of things...  1) Read  A Midsummer Night's Dream  and finish the handout about it. 2) Find theater journal articles about  The Merchant of Venice  3) Write my "Qualities of a Good Mate" essay for Christian Home 4) Choose 2 sample theater job opening advertisements for Contemp. Drama 5) Form outline for Contemp Drama final project (got it approved!) 6) Research  Six Characters In Search of an Author  for a paper and presentation 7) Read  Tartuffe  and write a 2 page summary 8) Choose topic for Theater History final paper 9) Type script for one-act project 10) Turn in one-act proposal 11) Reconfigure resume before auditions on Thursday 12) Research 1940's New Orleans and create sources list 13) Do script analysis for   A Streetcar Named Desire   In other words, I got a lot to do in the next three or four days. Thankfully, I only have one class today, and it doesn't meet until 2:00, so I can get some of this done by then. Unless I keep screwing around on the internet...  Yeesh. Better get moving.
