I'm in the executive conference room right now, testing the resolution of one of our spiffy new plasma screens. I like what the teleconference images look like, but we've yet to hook up a PC to the other display (hahah, we have twin 42" plasmas on the wall in here, pretty swanky if you ask me). As far as I know, this is the first time this has been done.    In order to test the image quality with moving RGB images, I have decided to show BMWFilms' series...hope it turns out okay!
