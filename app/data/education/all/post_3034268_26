OK, so there is a book quiz on the internet that asks you questions and then tells you which book you are, as well as a neat description about you and your book.  It's something like a personality test with a twist.  If you want to take it yourself, hit the "book quiz" button at the bottom of the post.        You're  Roots !   by Alex Haley     While almost everyone agrees that you're brilliant, no one knows quite how to categorize you. Some say that you're a person with an amazing family tree. Some say that you're just a darn good storyteller. Others say that you're both and don't much care where to draw the line. What is known is that your people have been through a great number of trials and that you are where you are because of hard work. You have nothing to lose but your chains.
