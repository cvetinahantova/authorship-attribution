I've got this timeline type paper above my bulletin board (and hence my calendar) where I write what number day of school it is. It was glorious last year to write "175" on May 27th. Today, I just kept looking at the "1" and internally sobbing.  It wasn't so bad - teaching moves fairly quickly if you actually have an idea what you're doing, which I may or may not come the dreaded month of October. Still, despite a slightly underprepared first day, I came out OK, except for the muscle aches, hardcore fatigue, and desire to crawl into bed and never get out.  I had a little girl throw up twice today - she threw up about 8:20am, I sent her to the nurse... the nurse sent her back, she tossed her cookies again around 10:10am, I sent her back to the nurse... she came to lunch with us, didn't eat anything, and again she went back to the nurse... then back to me, said she felt sick... back to the nurse... finally, the aunt came and got her. You can't really prepare for that kind of stuff. I had a kid vomit on his desk during reading in my first year, then sit and stare at it as I tried to hustle him off to the nurse. Man, I never thought I'd write that last paragraph.  Tomorrow holds the promise of a reading assessment (a state reading test administered 2 years ago) which I will score and present to my principal. Funniest shit is, last year I did this, took about 3 weeks to do it, had no idea why I was doing it, and finally submitted it, never looking at it again. Hopefully this time I have some form of a clue.  Ah... Wednesday's the half day... it's almost here.
