I am in bed again. There is really no reason to get up when you have forgotten to buy  urlLink Crunchy Nut Cornflakes . They really do Taste Too Good.   I checked the  urlLink weather;  today is going to be muggy and hot with 'thundery downpours'. For the love! No sunbathing for me. Unless I want to do that romantic comedy thing of getting caught in a deluge wearing only a thin vintage dress and fancy bra, and then trying to keep my head dry using a newspaper only it doesn't work and my hair falls engagingly around my face in damp curls which are in turn tugged playfully by a sensitive and wistful man walking a Dalmatian who is sheltering under the same tree as me.   Surreal dinner conversation #372    I wish there was more than one way to get married. Like, you know there's more than one way to have a funeral: you can be buried, you can be cremated, you can be put in a cardboard box with an acorn ... I wish weddings were like that.   Yeah. So do they put the acorn in your belly button or just in your hand or what?   I'd love that, to be buried with an acorn, not because it would be really humble and unaffected, but because I can't think of a more egotistical monument  -  A TREE!   Everyone shelter under me! Make way for my roots! Come, squirrels, tiny animals, nest in me!   Yeah, or a fruit bush and everyone could eat a piece of me   I wouldn't be a crappy  fruit bush , I'd want to be A MIGHTY OAK!   A GIANT REDWOOD!   But if we're both really big trees they'll have to bury us really far apart or one tree might strangle the other with its roots.   I could be a tree and you could be a climbing ivy then   Fuck off, I'm not being ivy. You be ivy.
