So! I nearly got beaten up today. I laughed oddly at Ripu and she told me I sounded like a sheep, so, being me, I "baa"d at her. Unfortunately the man walking past at this particular point in time somehow seemed to take offence at this, turned around, spat on the floor and asked me if I wanted a "fucking slap". I told him I wasn't talking to him but Ripu, and he once again assured me that, had I been talking to him, I would have got a "fucking slap". How I love living in Walsall. No wonder I'm scared about getting 6 rejections from UCAS- I can't wait to get out of this shitty town...  Ceff x   I hope you choke on those words that kiss that bottle
