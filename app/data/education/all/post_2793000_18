OMG! I, amazingly, was invited to join my H*R fan forum's AIM chatroom! I can't believe how lucky I am! It makes me feel like an accepted member of the community instead of a zombie follower...  Anydangway, I'm thinking of starting to be more like Strong Bad and start my own E-mail show! I have a place on Freewebs where I can do this, so you'll hear back from me about that soon.  So, in closing, you're an idiot.  Sincerely, darkshadows86, Lord of the Underworld
