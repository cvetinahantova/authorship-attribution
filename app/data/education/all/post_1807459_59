Little bit of time to kill before work again.  Why am I not hungry?  What has this sam gyup sal done to me?  I've had a banana today and that is it.  I think I'll just wait till I get hungry?  But then what if I don't get hungry and just die from starvation?  Man whatever I did I shouldn't do it again.  On Friday nights Bellagio has 20% off on cocktails.  Really it isn't 20% off but it's close.  6K cocktail is only 5K.  In reallity is should be 4,800 but who is counting?  Asma and I ended up hanging out on Friday and a bunch of new people at the Commune.  We then hit New Blue which is the awesomest place to drink in Daegu.  Oh-ni was out of town this weekend for her grandmother's b-day.  We haven't talked is a few days.  We'll see if things pick back up or not.  I think things could have played themselves out.  Not sure so we'll see.   I think I'm going to have to get a space heater.  Stephen keeps turning the heat off in the middle of the night, so when I get up to hit the  bathroom early in the morning it is freezing and I can't fall back to sleep.  What a pain.  Why is Korea so noisy?  Really, everywhere is so damn loud.  I wish could live somewhere without constant noise.  From the airplanes to the trains to the vegie/fruit vendors with their loudspeakers it just really begins to get old.  Not to mention random people walking down the street at night yelling.  What I wouldn't give for some  warmth, peace and quiet.  Is it really so much to ask for?  On to work.
