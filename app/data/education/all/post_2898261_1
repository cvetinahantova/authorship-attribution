I want to lay my head to rest Forget about this day Forget about the emotional ride That marked this shitty day.  I want to curl up beneath the covers Cleanse my mind of thoughts Cleanse the tainted train That I nearly caught today.  I just want to close my eyes Sleep a dreamless night Sleep until the end is near To end this eventful day.  Just want to have an early night Wake up and feel refreshed Wake up without the ringing In my fucking head
