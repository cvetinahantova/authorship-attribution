urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  was very persuasive and compelling, but I have to admit that while you're watching it you can't help but feel as if many of the clips are *very* strategically cut. I hestiate to use the word manipulative here, but I suppose that's  urlLink Moore 's whole point.     I think  urlLink the overtone is pretty much what a lot of people are secretly thinking but not necessarily wanting to believe ..  While the piece is far from flawless, it does remind us of this:   It's all about the money, honey . And covering your ass to keep the money at all costs. But then, we all knew that already, right?  Here's Peter on our way to the theatre:     I'm going to also confess that I have something of a soft spot for Moore. He answered all my emails when I used his film  urlLink The Big One  back in 1997 for a high school World Issues project. He was very encouraging to me, asked me some questions about Ontario and was generally very sweet (maybe in the same way a cantankerous old uncle trying to sway you to their views might be).  I'm still disappointed the  urlLink Rainbow Theatre  matinees were completely sold out. I'm sorry about that guys, I didn't even think to call and/or buy tickets ahead of time, but duh..I guess all cheap people were flocking to the theatre downtown.  Fireworks are going to start soon. Time for me to fetch my earplugs...
