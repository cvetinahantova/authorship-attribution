-------------------Sup Kids----------------------------  It's a new month, which means, i'm still angry/angst-ridden. Whichever you prefer. But since it's July, that means where smack-dab in the middle of baseball season, and the good news is that the tribe and the mets have an actual chance of winning their divisions! Not the tribe, so much, because their top 3 starters: 1)CC Sabathia 2)Cliff Lee 3)Jared Westbrook....and the white so top 3: 1)Loaiza (still) 2)Buerhle (still) 3)Freddy "Look who got fleeced because miguel olivo needs surgery and he's on his 3rd team this season" Garcia. And the Twins aren't that bad either. go tribe. --------------------Movies. No reference here.--------- Want to know something?
