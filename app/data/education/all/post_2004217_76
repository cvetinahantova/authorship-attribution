Hehehe. I am SUCH a cheapskate, but at the same time, SUCH a genius. Have invented a new website,  urlLink These trusty chords , which has photos and my reviews on. The reviews that are on there are basically the ones that aren't on  urlLink SickHappy , although I may transfer those ones aswell seeing as the site is pretty dead. The photos are ones I want to add to blogs, but instead of paying for Blog*spot pro or whatever it's called, I'll put the photos I want to show you on there (for free!), and then put links to them! Genius! So that's the background. Click  urlLink here  to see photos from the Third Enigma show.  This has no relevance to any of the previous stuff, but I have to get it off my chest: the adverb "basically". STOP USING IT!! We had to present some information we'd researched on various parts of grammar today, and bloody hell, the number of times "basically" was used in a descriptive statement was just ridiculous. When it comes to my turn I will make a determined effort not to use it. If I do, I will reprimand myself severely; starving seems appropriate, but only because I have eaten like a big fat carbohydrate covered pig for the last 3 days. Bad squishy.  The "leaver's ball" debate continues... which leaver will get to go? Hehehe. "Babble babble bitch bitch", as Mazza would say.  Ceff x   It's so easy not to think for yourself anymore...
