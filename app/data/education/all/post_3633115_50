I have come to realize that I have a severe illness.  Yep, I cannot walk past a computer without feeling an overpowering desire to check blogs, check my email, and post about something.  Does this mean I will be slowing down on my posting??  Not intentionally.  I am aware I posted A LOT yesterday, but today I really have nothing to blog about.  This really bugs me.  I like posting.  I like making sure my (wonderful) readers have something to read. So at this time, I will allow a list to be made.  Please feel free to comment about stuff you would like to see me blog about.  I might not do it today or tomorrow, but I will likely keep it in reserve for when I run out of other material.......like today.  That is all.
