hi guyz, its been a long week lately and i'm more than hapi to b able to post this on the blog... i watched AMI until 12 laz nite and today i face the music, feeling like a completely worn out duffel bag because i am so shacked and i have nearly no energy to do anything, and to think that i actually survived through my choir practice (standing up, using diaphragm support, keeping focused) really seems quite a feat when i think about it now. i saw heath chan in school today during my PE lesson, which i skipped (post exam period PE lessons amount to nothing) and we were really surprised, coz i was with bernard and miguel, and we found out he was sick and his dad was around to pick him up so that he could go home...well i believe him...explains why he didnt go for choir 2 weeks straight, although he did  ponteng  hmm... my favourite song for today is  on the horizon  by  melanie c  (out of spice girls) so here are the lyrics:   People see different things When they look on the horizon Do you see dark clouds rolling in fast Cos baby they ain't gonna last  And I can't see anybody else I can't stop looking at you Take this dream and make it true  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin  This world could be so hard to take Before I found you, I almost stopped trying To see the good instead of the bad But your hearts so true, that baby I'm cryin  And every single time we meet I learn what love is for It's taking less and giving more  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin  And baby I don't wanna see pain in your eyes Cos you're the one that sets me free There's nothing in this world that can hurt us If it's you and me, hey-yeah-yeah  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah (All i see is love on the horizon) Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin  I-I'm, flyin baby (All I see is love on the horizon) I-I'm, flyin baby  All I see is love, sweet love On the horizon, oh yeah Just one look in your deep brown eyes And baby I'm flyin    there'll be a concert to watch acs choir, guitar ensemble and chamber orchestra, titled  kaleidoscope  anyway i hope my ahs pals will help me to buy tix ok? i will definitely go and support u guys at your combined concert so i hope u will support me...and btw i really hope to see u guys at the syf choral festival soon... i might not go to malaysia at all this holiday, coz my dad's busy and all my siblings have stuff on each week, like tutorials and ccas, and youth camp, so we cant really compromise with everybody. tomorrow there's the parent teacher meeting going on while i attend my choir practice at 9 am...yawn...my mum will go alone, to see my hcl, english, e math, and ss teachers, initially the physics teacher too but i couldnt find him after school to fit in a time slot... tonite is the results show for AMI, and i want to watch it really bad...i know who the winner is already but i cant give out the secret yet coz everyone's gonna get mad with me, right? oops its dinnertime, gotta go, i'll post the next one tomorrow, cyazz!
