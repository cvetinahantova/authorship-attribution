I've read the most amazing book:   The God of Small Things .  Arundhati Roy is an amazing writer.  Her words are put together in the way I want my words to read -- as if they're just channelled out of her mind, through her fingers and onto the page.  At times, it's stream of consciousness, without the self-consciousness of writers who want to sound like it, but really work over it until the soul is gone.  Arundhati Roy has soul.  "Two egg twins" are with their loved better than they are cousin when she drowns.  They are we, not me and him.  Their life together and apart is the subject of the book.  It's sad.  It's beautiful.  I had to read it twice in a row -- the first time, all I could do was listen to the beautiful words, like a written song.  The second time, I tried to focus more on the story.  I read in an interview somewhere that she doesn't edit after she writes.  What we're reading is what she meant to say the first time.  Oh, so beautiful.
