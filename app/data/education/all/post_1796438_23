Year 11 makes you feel old  It's kind of depressing thinking that we as year 11 are getting older. All I have to say is that you guys in Esperance are so lucky because you get boss around year 8, 9 and 10. Me, I get to boss around any poor soul who peeves me off.  On a happier note, this song below is the was sung by Billy Crystal at the Oscars on March 1 (Australia time). You have to sing it to the tune of the sound of music. here goes...  Hobbits with feet big and hairy and smelly More horrific battles than Gest and Minelli  Ian and Viggo are Queen and some Kings this is the gang in the Lord of the Rings  Frodo and Sam on a mythical planet then Smeagol pops out like the right boob of Janet  Britney and JLo broke both of their flings They thought it was called "The Return of the Rings"  Lithium social pills and peyote Moonshine and brittan from Truman Capote JRR Tolkien was taking these things when he contrived the Lord of the Rings  Peter Jackson made it THREE though. He sure got it right. I loved every frame of The Lord of the Rings. So I downloaded it Last Night. All Night All Night Long!   bye!  (the song is my quote)
