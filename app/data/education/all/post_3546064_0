My wife and I spent 5 days hauling heavy luggage all over several airports and the city of Orlando, and when we got back, we wanted nothing more than to set our bags down, order Chinese food, and bask in the glory of a meeting-free afternoon and evening. So of course, the second the luggage hit the bedroom floor, I went out to buy some jigsaw blades.         Coping saw  I wrote earlier of my failure to execute a nice rip cut using my cheesy jigsaw, which is the four-point-something amp kind that you can buy from home centers for about $40.  I described the sort of vibration that threw the cut out of line and threatened to shake the fillings from my teeth, and how this motivated me to try a handsaw, specifically a rather cheap coping saw, for the recurved pattern on the feet of the bench I'm making. I said the coping saw actually worked pretty well.  All the while, I harbored the suspicion that I'd chosen the wrong blade for the cheesy electric jigsaw, and that was why it greeted the wood with an epileptic seizure.  I have a plethora of jigsaw blades, and while I am told that there are ways of telling them apart, I have yet to master the task. I thought I picked the right one. I probably didn't.  So after setting down the luggage, I went to a Big Box and bought the jigsaw blade set for dummies.  It's by Skil, and they print the blade's purpose right on it.  The set comes in a plastic case that keeps other tools from bunging up the blades.  Now it was time for a comparison of old-fashioned coping saw and newfangled cheap jigsaw. I fitted a scrolling blade to the jigsaw and attempted to follow the recurved outline I had traced for the bench foot.         Jigsaw  Whaddya know? The piece of junk worked great.  The cut it produced was about ten times cleaner than the coping saw cut, and was about 50 times easier to execute.  Vibration was no big deal.  It worked so well, I used it to go back over the coping saw cut, shaving off about 1/16" to clean it up. So here's my advice: Buy a cheap jigsaw.  They work.  There's a reason why machines have replaced hand tools in all but the most specialized shops.  Keep in mind that I was working on pine and not 5/4 hard maple. For that kind of work, you might opt for a more powerful jigsaw.
