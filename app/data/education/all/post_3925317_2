I'm not going to go work out today.  I feel bad knowing that I'm going to skip being good, but I can't help it.  Ted and I just got back from our trip to Florida, and with the incentive of having to take of my shirt gone, I have no desire to work out.  It's sad really, though, that I even feel the need to work out.  Let me clarify this a little.  What's sad is that I have no desire to work out for the health benefits.  For that, I feel that I eat well enough and walk twenty minutes each way to and from the light rail to my house when going to and coming from work.  What I really want when I'm working out is one of those bodies that the men on  Out  or  Men's Fitness  always have.  People have (quite logically tried to convince me that they spend hours per day in the gym and get  paid  to look like that, whereas I just get paid to sit on my arse and goof off on the Internet (!) .  Still, I want such a body!
