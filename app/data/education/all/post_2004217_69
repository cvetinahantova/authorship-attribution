Ugh. Uggggghh. UGGGHHHHH. I feel like a big blob of goo on the floor, all icky and flattened. I got so pissed off this morning after being promptly told to "get over" the fact that one of my friends thought Kris was "pervy", "creepy" and "weird". God forbid I try and fucking defend a close friend, I'm soooo sorry that my friends don't live up to your standards. Stop thinking you're better than everyone. Combine that with an inability to breathe and total writer's block, and the result is something akin to being kicked. Hard. Twice.  UGGGGHHHHHH x   All time lows
