Last night I went home and took a nap, I didn't wake up until about 8:00 when Cop got home from class.  I must've been in a really deep sleep because I was all confused and groggy when I woke up, not to mention in a bad mood!  He just kept staring me asking me what's wrong and telling me how bloodshot my eyes were.  I just kept thinking, what the fuck is he talking about?  I was getting really irritated.  So i sat up, and decided to recline my seat, when I did, the back of the couch hit the wall and make a loud noise, and for some reason that REALLY pissed me off.  So i got up and started cussing at the couch lol I tried to push it away from the wall but it was too heavy so I kicked it as hard as I could.  Cop was watching the whole couch rage incident from the kitchen and had this look on his face like I was posessed.  I'd like to think I was, because that whole thing was pretty retarded now that i look back at it, but I was pissed at the time.  Anyway, i laid back down on the couch and went back to sleep, once I woke up for the 2nd time I was fine and in a good mood.  I guess I just woke up on the wrong side of the couch.
