urlLink Raising Minority Academic Achievement: The Department of Defense Model. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Bridglall, Beatrice L. and Gordon, Edmund W.  From the ERIC Digest:  The U.S. Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), a civilian agency of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), operates two separate but parallel education systems: the Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) for children of personnel stationed in Europe and the Pacific, and the Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) for children living on bases in the U.S.   According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a national, ongoing assessment of student performance, the average academic performance of all students in DoDEA schools is high, and the performance of African American and Hispanic students is among the highest in the nation. Based on this evidence of success and the fact that DoDEA schools share some of the same characteristics of many of the nationâ€™s public schools, a research group at Vanderbilt University examined the high achievement of African American and Hispanic students in DoDEA schools. This digest will summarize the results of their study, March toward Excellence: School Success and Minority Student Achievement in Department of Defense Schools (Smrekar, Guthrie, Owens, & Sims,2001), along with supporting research identifying policies and practices that may contribute to the success of DoDEA schools.
