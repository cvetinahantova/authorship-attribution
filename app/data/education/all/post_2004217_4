Wahey! Look at me, Blogging away.  Welcome! To the (probably less interesting than it sounds) Blog of Ceff. I'll be including jokes, hilarious stories along with my usual dose on cynicism on all things male. Don't get me wrong, men are fab (Mmmm... Men ;o)), but I also happen to believe that they are all mean, mean people who keep their brains in their trousers and never change one bit. I would go into details about how I came to this conclusion, but I don't feel like it today. Maybe another time when i'm feeling much more self-pitying.  So! Onto today's random ramblings... 1. For the first time EVER I didn't want to go to English today. It was such a horrible feeling! I felt so guilty... I went, obviously, being the good, studious type, but the passion wasn't there. Gutted. Mind you, I didn't really want to be in school at all today, I would have much rather just stayed at home and thought about...  2. MEN. Well, first things first...GAZ. It's all very confusing. I doubt he really remembers me that well, but because I know ABSOLUTELY NO MEN, I remember the few that I have the privelege to meet in great detail. So- texted him on Sat, invited him out with us on Thurs, but alas, no reply. Will text again tomorrow, with the approval of Liz, who seems surprisingly encouraging about the whole situation- suggesting I went with him to the VALENTINE'S DANCE! Good. Grief! It's all very confusing.  So, that is the current situation... as soon as more interesting things come up that are fun to read and play around with, I will add and stuff, cos this is all very exciting...  I should do something productive now... I'm sure this counts!  See you at the show Ceff x
