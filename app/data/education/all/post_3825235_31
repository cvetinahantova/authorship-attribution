I collect elephants.  I have since my freshman year in high school, and even though I haven't gotten many new ones in recent times, I still like to buy more when I come across them.  I have all sorts of elephants...stuffed animals, blown glass, ornaments for the Christmas tree, picture frames, boxers with elephants on them, and ones carved out of materials such as Mahogany and ivory.  And now, a beautiful clay one.  Which leads us to my picture.  I would like to introduce the newest addition to my family!  urlLink     Uhhh...he doesn't have a name, yet.  Bummah...I haven't found one that fits him, yet.  But isn't he a cutie?  (yes, I decided it's a boy)  Earlier this summer, we went to visit my sister in Washington, and we were there for like 2 weeks.  One of the places we went was to a place called The Painted Plate.  It was a place where they had clay figurines and stuff that you can paint and they'll fire it for you.  Of course, you gotta pay for it, but it was  so  worth it.  I know that when I get my own kitchen I would like to go back and paint a couple of plates and stuff to use to decorate my kitchen.  It was neat.  SO, anyway, I picked this cute little elephant-friend to paint and adopt into my herd.  I love the toenails.  :)  Well, probably because that is the kind of color I would use to paint my toenails.  Hehe.  AbbieDabbie painted a beautiful mermaid.  She was still going through the phase where she loved The Little Mermaid movie with Ariel and all.  So, her mermaid has red hair.  :)  Quite appropriate, I think.
