Tonight's iced chai from the Red Rock Cafe in Mountain View was not nearly as good as the iced chai I made when I was in the North Cascades.   When we were canoeing, we had to purify the lakewater with iodine. Since it didn't taste wonderful, we often added some lemonade powder to it. One morning, I poured powdered milk into my water by accident (thinking it was lemonade!). Yuck! So to make the best of the situation, I decided to make some chai. I added a chai tea bag, placed my red Nalgene in the sun, and let the sun do its work. By late afternoon, I had warm, steeped, tasty chai! When we canoed into Devil's Creek gorge, the water temperature dropped by tens of degrees, so I tied my Nalgene onto the stern of the boat and dropped it in the water to chill. Yum, iced chai!   Tonight's chai wasn't nearly as good.
