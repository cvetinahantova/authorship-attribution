the above would be my current lunch... how's that for a lunch menu at 4pm when i've only been up since 1?  go finals week. steve klee just said i get a thumbs up and a seal of approval just for that.  go me.  thought #1: it never ceases to crack me up that when you go to a liquor store (i keep ending up in states where you can't just buy alcohol in the grocery store... go figure) they put your stuff in a plain brown paper bag.  it's not like people can't guess that because you have a plain brown paper bag you probably have some kind of alcohol in it.  most other places that give you paper bags advertise on them anyhow.  but it's like despite the fact that everyone probably knows what you have inside the mysterious bag anyhow, they recognize the social stigma or whatever have you of having alcohol and are trying their darndest to disguise it... this makes me laugh.  the end  thought #2... what on earth is going on with my M&Ms?  check this out:    thought #3: duuuuuuuuuude  later
