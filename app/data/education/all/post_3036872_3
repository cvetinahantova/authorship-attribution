a bee on the sidewalk pinned down by rain  -a haiku written in Decatur, IL    I spent this morning planting Begonias in the garden.  I'm trying to soak up nature before I go to Houston.  I like cities, I do.  But I just feel  off  when I'm in urban areas for too long.  I start finding nature in interesting places when I'm in the city.  Once, I watched a balloon caught in tree branches for 15 minutes.  It was one of those accidental beauty moments that Milan Kundera writes about in  Unbearable Lightness of Being .  If I hadn't packed the book already, I'd find the quote.  Basically he writes--with great eloquence--that beauty in the countryside is obvious.  A flower, tree, sunset.  But in the city, any beauty people find is accidental.  Decatur, IL., was one of the ugliest cities I've been in--industrial, polluted.  So, in my head, I started to think of things in terms of nature.  Like, trains were bellowing animals (a terrible cliche) or dams holding back currents of traffic.  And, outside of nature, I just started to appreciate its own humdrum beauty.  Big porches, sweet tea, girls with ribbons in their hair.  The general run-down look.  I hope that Houston's natural side will sneak up on me, too.  Okay, enough with nature.    I'm having second thoughts about Teach For America.  Not,  Maybe I shouldn't do this , but  What the hell have I gotten myself into ?  I was reading more theoretical stuff last night, and I got really anxious.  I had to stop reading, stop thinking.  It's just that I'm starting to doubt my ability to do this.  There's so much to remember, and I'm just afraid I'm going to make some grave mistake that will ruin my students for all eternity.  I don't really believe this, but last night I was freaking out.  There's just so many little things to remember, so many passages I've starred, underlined, high-lighted.  I write myself notes in the margins:  Jenna, DO THIS!
