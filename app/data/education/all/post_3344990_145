Attire:  Come as you are...  grubbies are okay. He'll be washing our clothes anyway. He said something about new white robes and crowns for everyone who stays till the last.

Also, He's keeping a list of His friends for future  reference. He calls it the "Lamb's Book of Life."   Party being given by His Kids (that's us!!)! Hope to see you there!
