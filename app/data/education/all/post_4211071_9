It was really a fun night! I was rocking to the down to the floor and up to the ceiling... the whole family were at my place (em.. my home actually)... well, not all really.  My sister  was sick, so she couldn't make it. Even my baby nephew was up until midnight because he was really annoyed with our 'fiesta'... The concert held really well. I watched all of them;  Zahid ,  Adam ,  Kaer ,  Farah ,  Bob  &  Linda .        Zahid :    He performed really well. The first song, he looked alright. He got the right mood and feel, just that I think he got his pitching wrong at few places in the song... chewahh, now i'm critisizing all of the them :)... for the second song, erm... not sure of what the name was but it was made by  Cat Ruffedge ... a  funky cool dance song . I was happy to hear that song, since I am  Ruffedge No.1 fan ! Overall... I'm giving  Zahid  --  9  out of  10         Adam :    What about  Adam ?? By his looks, he is cute and charming.. as for his dance, he got the talents in that particular moves :) but too bad,  Adam  wasn't giving his all best last night. His vocal were bad (for me). He got his pitching out to other places... the first song,  Oh La La ... I have no doubt that he is so crazy about  KRU  but he shouldn't have copyright the whole  KRU  idea... he must have done somehing different which possess his true identity, like representing his group,  Es D Corp  (it sounds like that yo~)... as for the second song, it was great!!! He did quite well with the song made specially by  Ajai .. I like the melody of the song and the lyrics as well... Overall... I'm giving  Adam  --  6  out of  10         Kaer :   Well, I wasn't hoping that  Kaer  would win anything. I don't think that he is strong enough with his vocals and performance...  Kaer  didn't possess enough of him last night, which was quite  devastating  for me and my family as well. I was thinking that Kaer would threw all of him but he didn't! He was still with his R&B clad... he needs some changes... he should open more to other genre not only concentrating with R&B... :'( ... he sang  Michael Buble  -  Sway ... the second one was really into lullaby... I like the lyrics and the composer was really great and cute... Overall... I'm giving  Kaer  --  6  out of  10         Farah :    I have no other words to express her performance.. she was superb! She was great!! Too bad that she didn't win any of the 3 places! I was hoping that she could be the winner or second after  Zahid ... Overall... I'm giving  Farah  an excellent grading --  10  out of  10         Bob :   Another talented man from  Limbang, Sarawak ...  mesraaaa~~ ... too bad  Bob  didn't win. He presented his two songs very well. I like  Bob  ( as for his vocal and versatility )... I don't like his attitude... so, there is nothing for me to say about his performance... Overall, I'm giving  Bob  ---  9.5  out of  10         Linda :    Arghh! I hate you~ I don't like you from the first week even! I hate it when you in back after the wildcard. I was hoping that  Zarina  would join back for the final. I don't want to comment her because she done it BAD~ I'm not trying to discriminate but she was last night... she didn't perform it well... sorry  Linda ~ at least you won.. Overall... I'm giving her ---  4  out of  10        Ah... I'm so tired~ this morning my mom woke me up and asked me to join her to attend a wedding @  Serasa . I was okay with it, since I was really in the mood of  jalan-jalan . I met lots of cute lads. I met   MATUL  !!! She was there... but I was in different part of the function :)... ok, it feels like my fingers  kan putus  because I had been typing for 3 hours now...        p/s : I'm going to get my new  AR - Alfio Raldo 's shoe and handbag today... I paid it already, opps.. my mom had paid it for me... yahuuuuuuuuuuuu~~ I'm going to have new stuff!!! I'll be sending my  kains  to the boutique for my Raya and oh... did I mention that I'll be sitting exams on the first week of raya?? Yeah, I am!! I'll be having new clothes for my next year's raya...  uwaaaaaa  :'(
