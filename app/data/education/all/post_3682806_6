100% mountain spring water and the finest "high-country barley".    Coors Origional...     As far as the cheap beers go you just can't beat coors in the can. When the cold aluminum hits my lips I'm taken away to an imaginary log cabin where jimmy dean is griddlin' up breakfast and ted nugent is gettin the gear ready for our bow huntin' trip.   We're gonna be drivin' the quads. It's muddy out. Lucky for me I got on my rubbers over my flannels.    I'm a little tired cause I stayed up all last night with charlie daniels, we were jammin out on the front porch by lamplight. We had a pit fire going to ward off the skeeters....   After that last sip though I get thrown back into the here and now. A game cube and a drum machine are poor substitutes for a boning-knife and my lucky hawk feather.   ps- Newcastle and Guiness are great, but everyone should spend a little time at the cabin now and then.
