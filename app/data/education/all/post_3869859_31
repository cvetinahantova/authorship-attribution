"Don't fear too many things-- it's dangerous Don't say so much, you'll ruin everything Don't worry yourself into a corner, and Just don't think about it so much.  The girl you're gonna meet doesn't look like anyone you know And when you meet her, your toes might tingle Or you might suppress a yawn, it's hard to say Don't box yourself in Don't leave yourself wide open Don't think about it every second, but just don't let yourself forget  The girl is out there."  from  Go Fish
