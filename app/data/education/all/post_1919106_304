Every once in a while I pick up a decent recipe on TV. The last one was on  urlLink David Rocco's Dolce Vita . I forgot the title of the recipe, but it was basically eggs poached in tomato sauce with cheese topping. I tried it last night, and boy is it tasty! So you take a frying pan, empty a can of tomato sauce in it, warm it up, put 3 or 4 eggs in, top it up with grated cheese (I used mozzarella), and presto! Well, for a spin I fried some bacon before adding the tomato sauce. HOT DAMN is that good! Definitively a keeper. And cheap too! Use 1/2 can and 2 eggs for individual portions.  Of course Alton Brown's  urlLink Good Eats  is always a good place to pick up ideas. Did you know that the guy has a  urlLink blog ? He's a pretty smart fella, and the good thing about his cooking tips is that they can be adapted and mixed into other recipes. One of the tips that I use most is how to pick a good pineapple. Specially now that they're on a special at Sobey's. Damn tasty they are.  Who else is on my "good recipes" list? Well,  urlLink Jamie Oliver  of course! The nice thing about  his  recipes is that they are not only fancy, but they're also done with considerably common ingredients. Part of my famous bacon-wrapped chicken recipe was adapted from one of his recipes.  But I have to give the most credit to  urlLink Mario Batali . He's the one who kickstarted me into fancy cooking. His recipes are down to Earth, but he manages to mix the flavors quite like an art.  Now, one of the shows that I'm most looking forward to this season is  urlLink Forever Summer , because the recipes I've seen there are not only tasty, but also add in nice presentation right into the preparation. Plus, the hostess has a rather dashing voice and look.
