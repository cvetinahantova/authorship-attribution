urlLink What Should Parents Know About Information Literacy?  This is a page designed to help parents understand the importance of information literacy for their children.

Increasingly, it is more crucial—and more difficult—to be able to filter out information that is biased or unnecessary and weave together a vast amount of relevant information. The extent to which your children master these skills when they are young will have a significant effect on their quality of life as adults. This brochure explains the concept of information literacy, shows why information literacy is important for your children, describes how you can help your children become information literate, and directs you to additional resources."
