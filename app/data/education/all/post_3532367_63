Last night was awful. The medication (Fluoxetine 20mg) kept me up all night. I must have literally woken up every 15 minutes, but I dont feel tired now. We had gone to be early - 22:00hrs, together.   To be honest I had hoped we might have intercourse, but we didn't and I lay there trying to go to sleep while making an effort to keep my hands off. I "felt like zebedee" (from the magic roundabout) I could have gone for a 20 mile run. When I did drop off, I was very aware that every time I woke up I turned to my wife for a hug and more often than not tried to fondle her, kiss her or try to get some form of sex from her (I couldn't stop myself) - she must have felt very drained waking up to tell me to "get off" every couple of minutes.
