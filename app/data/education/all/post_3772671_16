We're always thrilled to see Schwarzenegger in the news, as he combines both German and gender studies. He really is  fantastic  in "Pumping Iron" and some of his other movies, including "Terminator" and "Total Recall"--a smart man's Sylvester Stallone I used to say. And the night he won in California, with all those Kennedys and movie stars on the stage, was pretty magical in its glamour.     But he should probably keep his mouth shut more often than he does. The "girlie men" remark was especially ridiculous in light of the fact that some of the people he was including under that category were women! Is "girlie men" short hand for a gender/sex mismatch, so that it would also include "manly girls"? Or is it just about people who are too feminine, in which case he would be calling for the women to be more masculine?     Moreover, he claims that these legislators are wimpy because they won't stand up to special interests, but I have to say it seems to me to take more strength to stand up to Arnold than to elementary school teachers!      urlLink Yahoo!
