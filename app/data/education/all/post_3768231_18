Brrrr... 
 I checked the thermometer inside just a little while ago - and it was
 only 11c / 51f inside! No wonder I was feeling a bit chilly. Then I
 hear on the radio that it's snowing about 40km away from here, on the
 higher ground! Just as well it isn't really windy, otherwise it'd be  really  cold. I wasn't aware how
 chilly it actually was... I'd rugged up pretty well this morning, with
 lotsa layers on... it was only when I was having something to eat, and
 I noticed the steam coming with my breath... pmsl! But I love living
 around here - such a beautiful place to be part of.

 Troon...  
 what were they thinking, naming a golf course 'Troon'?!? Everytime I
 hear them mention it on the radio news, I can't help but smile. I
 thought it was bad enuff having a goldfish called 'Thoon'! pmsl!
