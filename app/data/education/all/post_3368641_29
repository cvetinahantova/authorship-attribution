Winter In Maine  ice crystals form mosaics as the warmth inside collides with the arctic winds meeting no takers the topography becomes rigid and the pocket of the hearth is not taken for granted  for the brave winged ones and vociferous red squirrels that find seed and cracked corn left by my quick paced circle around the yard placing my blessings at every feeder and scattering the fuel over hard and pitiless soil for the mourning doves and crows to keep warm  it is on days like this when there seems no habitable  corner to make rest when the sun doesn't rise as a natural furnace all I can see is  my neighbors from the woods huddled in packs picking for scraps that I feel a responsibility for all the simple wealth that I am comforted in to share with those  who are in need  I know they watch for me every early frigid morning  making the rounds with the seed buckets I catch glimpses in the branches cautious eyes in the underbrush but within moments of returning to the comfort of my heated womb they one by one  take my offerings  winter in maine is the worst predator and even the usual tops of the food chains find humble thanks for  every little blessing  Â©2004 DC Vision
