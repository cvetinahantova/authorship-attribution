What's up all.  I had the best sleep last night.  I actually got to sleep  LATE .  Can you beleive it?  I had a day to sleep until 11:00 AM.  I'm so satisfied.  LOL  I also started writing ideas for a new story i can't tell y'all 'bout 'cause I really just have random thoughts about.  If I ever work it out, I'll share.  Tomorrow I have an early class, but I'll go to bed early tonight to offset that miserable I don't wanna get outta bed feelings I get in the morning.  I just hate rolling out of bed.  I'm still a night person.    Song of the Day:   "Naughty Girl" By Beyonce.  It has the right beat to pump in my ride.  Love to hear it.
