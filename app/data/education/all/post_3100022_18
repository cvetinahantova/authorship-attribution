I felt like one of the subjects of that much watched Reality TV series "Airport" talking to the customs officer about why I was in London, how long I was going to stay and why I was wearing my pants on my head. I was almost worried when he walked away with m passport saying "Stay here, I just need to nip out and have a word with someone" as luck would have it he didn't come back with a big pale London army officer with a gun bigger than his... did I tell you that all the girls here say the men are quite small? I felt bemused and not a little worried at being deported before the fun even began, at this point I started on my super telepathetic powers of Jedi mind tomfoolery and kept repeating in my mind: "you don't need to see his identification, these aren't the droids you're looking for" Anyway I didn't need to worry at all as my pseudo arch villain became my night in shining armour when he announced that he was going to re-instate my long expired working holiday visa. Wow!
