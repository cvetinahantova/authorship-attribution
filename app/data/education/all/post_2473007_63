Like a child standing, gazing      At the verigated flames As they lick their pyre-tongue,     Play their deadly pyre-games.   Inner-person smothered     Underneath the rosy blaze; The mind at rest in ashes     With the eyes a distant glaze.   Awake, you inner-vagrant,     Recognize your living claim; Life consists of so much more     Than just hiding in the flames.
