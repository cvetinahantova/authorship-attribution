HAPPY 4TH OF JULY   Well yesterday my friends from church went to the Freedom Celebration Concert which was held at Cerritos College. The experience was great because I have never been to a Christian Concert before. It was cool because I went there expecting to have a lot of fun and hear the bands which were going to play and thats about it. Happily the night was very moving for me. Although the bands were great and we were having a good time It was awesome to see people by the hundreds receive Christ. I was able to witness God's power in a personal way. Tears rolled down my eyes as I observed the multitude of people walking towards the front to proclaim the prayer of salvation. After they prayed my friend and I prayed for those people. I was also impressed because the stadium filled up to its capacity and they even had to close the entrance. The night ended with an amazing firework show.
