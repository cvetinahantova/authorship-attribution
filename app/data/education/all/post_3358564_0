Ok, I'm writing up a syllabus for my literature class which will start in about two weeks.  They've changed the edition of the anthology. Certainly, I am glad to see that Shakespeare still matters--indeed! However, I'm getting annoyed with the enduring myth which claims Shakespeare's sonnets were written in the early 1590s.   Do these editors who put together these anthologies even read the latest scholarship?  I don't care what tradition holds. So sometime around 1595, Frances Meres writes that Shakespeare's Sonnets, were "sugared," and that is supposed to tack a date down for us?  Katherine Duncan-Jones, in her latest edition of the sonnets, has suggested otherwise; maybe as early as 1603, to perhaps as late as 1608-9. I tend to agree.    Let us consider the notion of revision for once. Shakespeare may have written some sonnets around or before the time of Romeo and Juliet, early 1590s, 1594-95, but most of the sonnets are indeed problematic, and dark, and cynical just as the latter "problem" plays, which were written after the new millennia--1600. Surely before the publication, he had time to revise, being that the theaters had been closed and problems of plague in London.   I find absolutely nothing in these poems which suggest any notion of Meres' "sugared" sweetness, but scholarly tradition is adamant. Yet still, I think the common assumption is wrong. Let's just look at "sweetness" in the poems:            "For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,             Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds"              (94,13-14).   Clearly, the lines are anti-sweet; in fact, the speaker seems to suggest just the opposite. Weeds are preferred over a multitude of sweet smelling flowers.  The image is not nice: weeds are better than flowers.  Really, who would rather have weeds instead of an abundance of growing flowers?    And again, the couplet of Sonnet 118:             "But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,             Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you"              (118, 13-14).   The language and imagery here evoke the illness and bitterness of being in "Love."  This speaker is jaded.  He's not sweetly in love; he has been poisoned by her. And this whole, "sick of you." It lingers.  It's like he's saying, "I'm sick of you, and how you intoxicate me, enchant me, as if I'm taking a bad drug." It's like a chemotherapy experience to him.  And certainly last but not least, Sonnet 147, one of my favorites,                  "For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,          Who art as black as hell, as dark as night"           (147, 13-14).   Clearly the speaker, is disillusioned.  He once thought his beloved to be bright and angelic, but now he concludes that she is a diabolical imp. Essentially, he's telling her "you are a lover from hell!"  Is that a sweet term of endearment?  And certainly, I could go on and on.  There might be a few sonnets which evoke "pathos."  However, debatable, how does one explain the cynicism as revealed in these couplets?  And it is just not these three poems.  All over the sequence there is this underlying sentiment of despair, frustration, and exhaustion.    My point in all of this?  How can scholars be so rigid in suggesting that these poems are indicative of a less mature Shakespeare? By asserting that these poems were indeed written in the early 1590s, we dismiss the complexity, the cynicism, the sexual frustration, and the over all peculiarity of these poems.   I don't believe that the Shakespeare who wrote "Romeo and Juliet" could have written these poems.  This speaker/lover does not "Kiss by the book," as Juliet would say.  No, this speaker is misogynistic like Hamlet, and he's disillusioned like King Lear, and slightly jaded like Prospero! These poems have been revised, and were written by an older Shakespeare probably around 1603, and then published in 1609.    Somebody at the MLA please get the word out!            Jumbled Chaos
