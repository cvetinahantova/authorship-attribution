I read this yesterday morning, its possibly my favorite image in the bible.  Something I aspire to:  Psalm 131:  My heart is not proud, O Lord, my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me. But I have stilled and quotient my soul; like a weaned child with its mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me,  O Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and for evermore.  There are times when I know I let myself get far too puffed up and concerned with great ideas and big thoughts.  At those times these images can have much to say.  Sometimes its good to question, but often its good to be quite, be with my Mother and let her guide me.  (it feels quite strange to me to refer to God as mother, something I'm not used to - but I guess that's another reason why I like this psalm.  Cos there is a massive difference between the Father role normally associated with God and the mother role which is hinted at in the bible a few times.  Feels odd but shouldn't.)
