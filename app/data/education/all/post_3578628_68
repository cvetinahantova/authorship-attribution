As the creator of the ring, I want to keep things fresh so people keep reading and posting and commenting and checking it out.  As part of keeping things going, I want to alert you all to the season premiere of Newlyweds.  There isn't anything that I can find that is wrong with this show.  For guys, you got the greatest looking woman in showbiz.  I have never seen someone look so good in Abercrombie sweats.  For girls, I know you all are checking out Nick's guns.  So please, everyone here watch this show so we can keep some quality on TV.
