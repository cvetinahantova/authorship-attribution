Hello bloggy.   Below is a mail I sent to the bB guys. Tomorrow, Shuqun will be proud of me.    Hello Wenwei and everyone,  I followed through the entire National Day Rally last night. It was an extremely proud moment for Shuqun Secondary when PM Lee mentioned the school.  If I am not wrong, PM Lee quoted Shuqun as one of the schools that is able to to think out of the box and come out with creative ideas. He said some of our students approached Mrs Chua to have a playstation and xbox in school. Their reason was because students go to the nearby arcade to play. And often, this results in comming contact with bad company. So they suggested to have a mini arcade in school instead. Parents volunteered to tend the area.  What an honour to be mentioned by the PM! The school's PSLE aggregate score has grown from 188 to 202 for the express stream.  Btw, I saw in the newspaper that Ms Tan won a presidential award. But it's in chinese, so I had difficulty reading it. =P Mrs Chua will be on channel 8 news tonight too.  To end of, I saw this quote that I like very much in Henderson last Saturday. I encourage everyone to give our best for the school and for God.  "Today, I proud of Shuqun. Tomorrow, Shuqun will be proud of me."  Dennis =D
