I  can't spell it, but I can make it.  This must be a good batch because my wife asked if I wanted to take some Altoids to work tomorrow when I kissed her good-night.  Pour 3 cups of boiling water over 1.5 cups of Bulgur Wheat.  Allow to sit for at least 30 mins.  While waiting mince/food process the following.  3 cloves of garlic 2 shallots The white ends and the first inch of green of about 12 Welsh onions or an equivilent amount of cleaned leeks. 1/4 tsp rosemary 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper 1/2-3/4 tsp allspice 1 tsp salt dash of whatever leafy spices are around (thyme, basil, marjorem, sage, dill, etc,) dash of cumin 1/2 cup good olive oil 1/2 cup lemon juice.  Chop finely the following 3 bunches of curly parsley 2 bunches of mint 12 more Welsh Onions 8-12 oz of Feta cheese  Sautee a handful of raw pine nuts until a nice dark brown in olive oil.  Once the Bulgur Wheat has cooled drain any remaining liquid and toss with spice lemon oil puree.  Continue to toss with handfulls of the chopped parsley mint and onions.  Add cheese and pine nuts.  With lots of veggies you may want to add a little more oil and salt.  Should have a sticky consistency without being too dense.  Serve at a little below room temperature, although letting it sit in the fridge overnight can be a good idea.  Great with any BBQ.
