Work: I wrote two+ fic pages on the 30th. Comments: I'm getting old, I tells ya--I can barely remember what happened on the 30th.  That's probably because I didn't get out of bed until almost 3pm.  As I recall, I taught class, and then went grocery shopping with Margot.  It was a pretty uneventful day, since Gordon wasn't in Hickman for me to chat with.  On Thursday, I finally got the horse insurance thing resolved, and ran more errands with Margot.  Ugh, July is going to be a nightmare.  We went to NYC and saw the  Threepenny Opera .  It was quite excellent, and it played at a theater that does classic plays only (which is nice--hopefully they'll do  Macbeth  soon (unfortunately their Shakespeare offering for '04-'05 is  Romeo and Juliet ).  The train ride was a disaster both ways--more reminders that New Jersey is truly the Land of the Troll People.  Of course, the major news concerns Coach K...I can't fathom what I'd do if he left Duke--I really can't.  He's coached there all my life.  I want him to retire there.  I know I have no right to be any part of this decision, and he needs to do what is best for him and his family, but...STAY K, STAY!
