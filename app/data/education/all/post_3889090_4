I believe in God because I want to and think it isn't irrational to do so. There. That's probably as good as it's ever going to get. I also believe in him because he seems to talk to me. Mybe it's my inner psyche, or maybe it's aliens or maybe it's my over active imagination. It's like that Matrix conundrum all over again. It doesn't matter. I can never know for sure so I'll chose to believe the most rational explanation.    OK, screw that. I want to believe in God. I can sort of. I cant run my life without the assumption that God is actually leading me. I can't live without believing that there is some purpose to what I'm doing.
