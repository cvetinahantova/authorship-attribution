Too many names..    Â  I'm not stuck up. But I try never to forget people once I meet them. I still know friends of mine since I was 8 years old, and I keep in touch with them regularly. I even know the names of people in my sister and brothers' class from way back when. Yah, maybe I'm weird, but once I see a face and a name..they are glued in my head and I'll never forget.  So now that I'm a teaching assistant for microbiology, though I have taught a semester of Biology 100 (wopee) too. I started teaching in fall 2002, and by now I have gone through around 200 students excluding this semester..but including this semester I'm sitting at 250 students. It's odd how I got to know all these students and I made it a point to memorize their names, their majors and their interests. But it's weird how I remembered their names one semester and then forget them the next semester, or now. So now I see these previous students of mine on campus and they are like "Mansoora do you remember me?", I see the familiar face so it's a "yes"..but then my mind gets pissed at itself for not remembering their names...my whole day then goes into remembering their names! I suppose I should just stick to memorizing my friends...heh heh..
