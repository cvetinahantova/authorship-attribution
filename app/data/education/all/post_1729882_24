Yesterday was bad enough.  This morning we got a call that our #1 son had been  arrested !  He spent the night with some friends and they decided to go out late and throw rocks at cars.  Must have dropped him on his head when he was little.  The sheriff was called, they were handcuffed, taken to jail,  and we were called.  He will have to appear in court soon and will probably have to pay damages to the car owners.  He says that he wasn't throwing at cars like the others were.  Unfortunately, even if true, that means squat.  The sheriff did say that he didn't show any attitude to them and was very polite.  Hopefully this scared the  SHIT  out of him.  His life is about to become quite different for the next several weeks (months?, years?).
