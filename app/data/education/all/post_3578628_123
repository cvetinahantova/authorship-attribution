I couldn't be more honest.  Right now, I just feel like telling my friends about what I did today.  This morning I woke up and could barely move.  But my relatives from Minnesota are here, so that sort of worked as motivation to get up and start my day.  I had a nice breakfast.  My mom made eggs and bacon and there also was chocolate banana bread and freshly baked bread too.  I then started Zoolander.  I bought it for about 2 dollars and all I want to do right now is finish it.  It could be awful and I wouldn't care because Ben Stiller and Will Ferrell rock!  I didn't get to finish it because the lock on our van wasn't working and my uncle called to have me drive over Malibu's Most Wanted.  (*For some reason my family is hooked on it.  I don't like it that much.)         I then had a family reunion.  Now, before I left, I thought I was going to like a park and we were going to have a cookout and it was going to be some shindig at Potato Creek or something.  Nope, we pulled in and we were on the farm.  Outhouse, tractors, grills, NASCAR....and my mind went "You might be a redneck if..." .  I soon forgot all that and I ate for about an hour nonstop.  Being on the farm, they crew their on corn and it was good.  There also were some great things to eat that other people had brought.  I played horseshoes which is fun but it gets a little boring after a while.  The best part was hearing all the people from 60-70 years old laugh about being old.  Of course there was that person who talks to you and makes you think  "who the hell are you?", but for the most part, it was fun.         Following that, we moved the party to my aunt's house and I taught the family how to play Texas Hold'em.  We then played a game called 13 which I'd like to play with friends sometime.  I'm back home and I'm happy to have such and entertaining and loving family.
