OK, so I started off well. Met Sandra at the bank and went for a coffee before heading off home. Halfway home my mobile rang and by the time I pull over its gone to the voicemail. I get the message "Relate have rung home and left a message with Mom, bit embarrassing but can you call them back."  Well I don't mind her taking the message but I'm not going home if she is there cos the kids will be there too and I won't get any sleep - what should I do?
