Yes I stole another lame quiz from Mieka's site.  I think this quiz is totally wack as I do confess to being a geek of geeks.  This all came pooring out on Monday night.  But that is for another time.    You are   11%   geek     OK, so maybe you ain't a geek. You do, at least, show a bit of interest in the world around you. Either that, or you have enough of a sense of humor to pick some of the sillier answers on the test. Regardless, you're probably a pretty nifty, well-rounded person who gets along fine with people and can chat with just about anyone without fear of looking stupid or foolish or overly concerned with minutiae. God, I hate you.      urlLink Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com
