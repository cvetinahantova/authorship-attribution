Ok, well, as for the cpu thing... they designed it to only go on one way, so I never did find out if it would work the other way...    Anyway, I might not order the volcano now, because I really don't need it. I am, however, going to order the two tornadoes, but one of them is going in my  urlLink new front mount . Last night I decided that there was no way in hell I'd ever use all 4 bays, and then I realized that a fan would fit perfectly in two of them, so voila. I also made a  urlLink cheap little baffle  out of printer paper to guide the airflow to the cpu a bit better... that's why I decided I might not get that fan. Actually, on second thought, I will still get the volcano...    Right, well, I've been updating stuff on devART a bit, and I think I'll go see if I can't scrounge up any more to play with.
