Just wanted to let everyone know I've added a few knew things to my site:  urlLink forums  and a  urlLink student blog called  "A Mind Ablaze"  .  You can log into the forums for some excellent discussion on everything from art to music to religion to etc. ad nasuem ad infinitum.  And of course, what all my students are giddy about this summer (he says as he smirks) - a new blog just for them!  You can all log in, check assignments, find out who needs to make up tests, get some encouragement, ask a question, or just waste time.  It's all there.  Have fun!   urlLink WEBFORUMS - http://www.plasticmind.com/forums   urlLink A MIND ABLAZE - http://www.plasticmind.com/ablaze
