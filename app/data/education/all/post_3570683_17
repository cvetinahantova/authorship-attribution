Well, I finally found someplace decent to host my blog.  My friend, Caitlin, had shown me a site to do it on, but it either started charging or shut down, I don't remember which.  But anyways, I decided I would add some of the stuff I'd been thinking and add on some of the dolls I've been making lately.  Over the summer I make pixled dolls and during the year I just run out of time during the day so I don't make them.  I'm going to have to figure out how to load pictures onto Blogger, so I'll be able to share them.  I'll add more later when I get done playing with the set up!! =)
