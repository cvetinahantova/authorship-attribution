After work today, I went to see my Physical Therapist.  The appointment went well.  So far, its just Ultrasound and some shock treatment to work the muscles.  Tony was really surprised how much voltage I was taking with the shocks.  He stood back and looked me up and down in disbelief, as he said my whole leg should be kicking with the amount of electricity going to my foot.  I think this could be an indicator of two things.  Either I can attribute it to my high tolerance for pain, or that I actually did damage nerves more than I thought when I screwed up some of the disks in my spine.  I'm personally hoping more for the high tolerance option.         Not too much else happened tonight.  I grabbed some Subway with a good veggie sub, had some good spaghetti, went to the driving range, and lifted some weights.  Overall, it was a good laidback night.  I didn't do too well at the driving range, but I did manage to hit my last ball at least a couple hundred yards into the darkness with the five iron, so that was a good note to end on.  I also tried calling Mr B, but all the cell phone circuits in Las Vegas must have been busy.
