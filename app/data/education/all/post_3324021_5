This morning I leave for The Royal Canadian Henley Regatta (See the   urlLink Henley Web Page ). Henley is a rather long event lasting six days. I depart this morning, the regatta begins tomorrow and depending on how well I do will return Friday, Saturday, or Sunday evening. For the time being I will be postponing my posting. If anything interesting happens at the Henley Regatta I will be sure to send an audio post. Other than that, I will give a recap of my travels when I return.
