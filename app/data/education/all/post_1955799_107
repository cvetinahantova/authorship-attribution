I wish I wrote yesterday, but I was knee-deep in editing a videotape for my class presentation.  With that being said, I also got my self some contact lenses.  My God, I had no concept of how these things work.  I also did't concieve of how I would blink so much.  I am somewhat annoyed by the process, but the chance to see a whole lot better iwas too appealing to let go of.  It's real nice.  Everything seems much brightere, even at night.  LOL.  Was I missing out on everything?  I know most people can take their vision for granted, but since I am usually as blind as a bat, it made for a better triumph.  It's so nice to see all around.  :-)   Song of the Day:     "Pink Casmere"   by Prince.  It's highly underrated, but a sexy Prince song nonetheless.  it's always good to listen to.
