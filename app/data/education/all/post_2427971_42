I guess i do know, I don't want to though. It's getting worse, I don't want it to. It gets worse the more I deny it, I thought it would leave. It used to only be when this was away from one, but it didn't seem to matter where this was this time. I don't know what to do, I'm afraid of the time after it's all done. I'm afraid of the pressure on my chest growing. All the pain it will cause and what these things will think, will I feel better or worse. I refuse to stop looking, there has to be something to hold on to. There has to be something to keep with me to remind me of the times, there has to be something hold me up... But there isn't, theres nothing keeping me from this feeling and it's starting to get out of control. I get nothing out of this, but I want nothing... Yet, I wish for something, I get nothing still. I should expect something more than what I get... Should I? I need to find this and stop hiding it... I'm making myself doubt this and want more and different things. I need to stop, I can't sleep. This is awful, I can't think. The words are lies and truth, I don't know which is stronger than the other. I want to figure out what I've got to do, the longer I take the more pain will be set upon me. What do I do...
