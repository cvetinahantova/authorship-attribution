As I lay my head down to sleep tonight I realize what Jesus said about his followers..."they will know you are Christians by your LOVE." Of course that is the song version I was taught growing up in the church. The apostle John's version says, "by this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another." The morning started with Dad and I bringing a bunch of boxes and other miscellaneous items outside in the turnaround at the end of our drive waiting for some more men to show up to help load the furniture on the moving truck first. We had no way ofÂ  loading an oak wardrobe, a workbench, or a lay-z-boy couch on the truck. We worked for about 6 hours bringing smaller items that we could carry out the drive before our brothers showed up. Ken, Len, Jonathan and Steve (my favorite brother-in-law) showed up just in time to help move all the furniture on the truck and then help with the jigsaw puzzle we had to put together to fill up the truck with all of my parents items they were bringing to Georgia. These men had worked hard days at their jobs and then came to the aide of my father and mother. That's true love. Where would we be without our community of believers? More tired and sore and NOT DONE PACKING!   What an awesome God we serve and what a wonderful institution we call the church, the body of Christ. Thanks guys for your help.
