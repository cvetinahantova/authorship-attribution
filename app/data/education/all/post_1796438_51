Another Assignment  Good to see everyone posting. Right now its 1:13 am and I'm all alone. Everyone else has toddled off to bed after complaining about the English Lit Tutorial. We each have different topics so we can't help each other without full-on stopping ours, learning the others persons topic and starting from scratch. Trust me, it isn't easy. I think I've got one of the easier topics (and to think I picked it cause it was the one left over!). I'm finished the introduction, the 2nd and the 3rd body paragraphs, and it already goes for 8 minutes. It has to be 9 minimum. All I have to do is finish up the first body paragraph, whack on a conclusion and I'm done. I'm considering adding a fourth body paragraph... Depends how I'm doing for time I guess (meant in both ways. Time as in how late it is, time as in how long it will take to say tomorrow).  Good luck
