I went to Target yesterday to pick up some medicine and walked out with Reeses peanut butter cups (the miniature ones), Reeses Scoops, and Peanut Butter Toast Crunch.    I just started to really love peanut butter.  I used to not like it at all.  Now I love it.  And I guess yesterday I was craving it.  And yes, that is Peanut Butter Toast Crunch cereal, as in Cinnamon Toast Crunch but not cinnamon, peanut butter.  I am now convinced it is the best food ever invented.  If you haven't tried it you should.
