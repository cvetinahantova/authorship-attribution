My second-favorite grouch/contrarian (the first, of course, being my Dad) turns 24 today.    There must be something about these end days of June, because two of my absolute favorite people ended up being born on consecutive days.  Clay was the first person who was ever nice to me without having a discernible motive for being nice to me (i.e., he didn't need my help with schoolwork, we weren't a part of the same "outcast" group, I wasn't the friend of a friend--he had nothing to gain, in other words)--that's not to say that I don't have  great , enduring friendships with people who had a "reason" to be nice to me, but I remain touched by his extension of random kindness.  I enjoy his company, because as he once said, "I bring out the best in you," and that is true in terms of humor, spirit and ambition.  One of these days I will send him, as a birthday gift, pink fuzzy dice for that car of his (this will probably happen when I get a job, 'cause these are the lean times for grad students in terms of cash)...either that or his very own Duke hat.       --Varenia
