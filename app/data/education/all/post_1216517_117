I don't mind being unemployed, for a little while at least. I go golfing. eat pizza. drink beer. it's not all that bad really. you should try it sometime, about a month is good. after that, it begins to wear on you.  i am going to be kevin millar for halloween.  in michigan everybody tries to sell a car out by the road.  There are so many cars for sale. There is road kill everywhere too. If the PETA people came to michigan, they'd have a heart attack. It's all over-- racoons, cats, dogs, opossums, deer, rabbits, skunks...crazy. Another thing, at gas stations, there's no "Don't top off" warning. I guess only california is concerned about the whole topping off issue.
