Mood:  Tired, anxious I need to revise for RE  Listening To:  Nothing :/  Mmm, not a bad English test today, slightly boring but not bad. If the test doesn't challenge me then meh I give up.  French wasn't too bad, though the final question sorta proved how not knowing one verb can ruin your answer, but hopefully that was the only mistake....doubtful.  Me and Jo met up today, talked about loads of stuff, including, tampons, childbirth, blowjobs and giving them, oral sex for women, slagness and how other people treat other people. This was of course after a good solid few hours of revision. Religious debate is fun with Jo. Opinionated Young people rule, except when they're wrong.  Wanna have someone to be with....tho I don't seem to like relationships :/  Rob from NW London seems cool, don't seem him on too much tho, and I don't want to rush stuff, there's no need.  After RE tomorrow the weekend will prolly be revision-based but if I could meet up with Robbie I would, he seems well decent and cool....hmmmm  I think that's it from me for today, maybe a update tomorrow, and no doubt some from over the weekend.
