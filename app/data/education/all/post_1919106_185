I am  urlLink not the only one  who's fed up with all the Shrek 2 ads. Sure, Shrek was a passable movie. It was fun while it lasted. But I'm getting tired of seeing that fucking green face plastered everywhere. Until recently I was tolerant of some banner ads on the web. They hosts have to make their money somehow. But in view of all this barrage I've started again to do something that I haven't done for quite a while - I've updated my hosts files. I don't want to have any more of that crap forced on me.
