Yippee !!!  I finally did it !  I made it into the top 1% of all  urlLink SETI At Home  users.  (SETI At Home is a project that uses the computer downtime of PC's to analyze data obtained from telescopes at the University of California at Berkeley.  The project currently has over 5,000,000 users and was one of the first major applications of distributed computing using the general public.  Users automatically download data and upload the analyzed results.)   It took me quite a long time (as you can see on the graphic), but there are simple strategies for making the processing efficient.   1. Use  urlLink Easy SETI  which runs the processing in the background, rather than the screen wasting display of the regular  urlLink SETI program .  (I had some unit cycles that were 100+ hours long, and now I regularly have 6-8 hour cycles.)  2. Run the program as "low priority" so that it doesn't grind your machine(s) to a halt for other applications.   3. Run the program on all of your computers, especially the fast ones.   (Big surprise.)  4. Increase the queue in EasySETI.  The Berkeley site that is regularly down so if you're done processing a unit you're not at their mercy to get new data for processing.
