Well, after a long and in-depth discussion of the merits of RX Bandits with Vez (Hey Vez!!), I have come to the conclusion that although The Resignation might be a very good album, it is not for the people who are expecting more of the same ska/reggae vibes that were on Progress. Although Sell You Beautiful is an AMAZING song, it is neither ska nor reggae, and as I bought the album expecting this, I was disappointed, as, I would imagine, all the other people buying this album expecting ska/reggae were. RX Bandits have definitely taken a new direction with this album, I'm just not sure whether I like it or not. Fair play to them for recording it live and all, but a lot of it still sounds very self-indulgent to me. Bring back the Ska!  See you at the show Ceff x
