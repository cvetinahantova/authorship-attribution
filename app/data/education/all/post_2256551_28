I feel so tired. I had a big blow out with my mom the other night. Sometimes I wonder if I really am related to her....... okay I just read kari's posts and I feel jealous in a way. She wants to go to her room and cut......I want to so bad...I really do but I can't. I wish I could it would make everything so much easier....... I hate the internet. It sux here cuz there are so many damn blocks.  Screw the group year book as well...........
