Here at the house we just shared a beautiful moment together. Dad got some cigars while he was in California this last weekend and he told the boys as a special treat that they would smoke them together. I don't know but just to see the boys get so excited to try smoking a cigar with dad was so great! It was cute how they were making smoke rings and taking pictures. Like I said it was a beautiul moment of father/son bonding time. Daddy let me try the cigar but I got laughed at because I got the smallest amount possible and when I tried to make a smoke ring I just made a poof, it was funny but I didn't like the taste, eww! Then after all that happened we sat and prayed as a family. I like times like that they are what life is all about.
