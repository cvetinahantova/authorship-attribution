urlLink U.S. Presidents and the Bible   Offers quotes from past U.S. Presidents on what they thought about the bible.  Although there is not a lot of analysis, the collections of quotes is impressive.  From the site:  The reverence for God of many of our presidents, coupled with the principles of liberty established in the Holy Bible, has provided the basis upon which the United States has been founded.  It is as true today as it was centuries ago when the psalmist wrote, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord" (Psalm 32:12). The nation that honors and reverences God will experience His blessings of protection, provision and peace.  I find it very interesting that while today they talk about separation of church and state, these men who led our country knew none of it. "Whereas today we have a separation of church and state, then there was a union.... Religion, virtue, statehood and citizenship were very much united." --Herb London  The American people are on the whole an industrious lot. Lyman Abbot, a preacher in the 1805, said: "A nation is made great not by its fruitful acres but the men who cultivate them; not by its great forests but by the men who use them; not by its mines but by the men who build and run them. America was a great land when Columbus discovered it. Americans have made it a great nation."
