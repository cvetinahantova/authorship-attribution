And now, the sound of Heather screaming in frustration...  Once upon a time, I took a bunch of preliminary classes for an education major. Then I dropped the education part of my major, and concentrated just on theatre.  Fast forward five or so years.  Now that I'm actually  wanting  to add the education part back onto my major, they've changed the preliminary classes you have to take before you're admitted to the College of Education. For example. the "Intro to the Profession" class I once took has since been divided into two classes: "Philosophy of Education" and a semester of teacher observation.   You'd think that they'd take everything into consideration, that when I first entered college, I did what was required of me to complete Coll of Ed entrance. Not to mention the fact that I spent almost two years substitute teaching, including half a semester in which I was employed full time because the school lost their elementary music teacher. Well, you'd think wrong.  I go to the Education Dept. to see what they would suggest I do-- could they count that as credit and waive the observation semester? They said to check with my advisor. So I check with my advisor, who says, "I can't do anything about it. Check with the Education Dept."  ::pulling out hair::  I hate to do this, because it's so juvenile of me, but I may have to play the Daddy card. After all, he got his Masters in Education there, knows the staff, and since he's very large and imposing, people listen to him and get things done.  It's that or add another couple of semesters onto my college career, which I can't afford, and be forced to graduate sometime in 2007.  I'm not happy.
