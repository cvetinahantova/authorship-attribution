Welcome to the first entry on my new Google Blog.  I have used blogs for quite some time, but more on a personal hosting basis.  I wanted to move to a community type scenario that would allow me to get a bit more exposure (as if I needed it) and the ability for others to read my thoughts (again, why?).  The whole basis of blogging is a bit odd to me, but I have to admit, it also interests me.  Instead of just expressing my views and thoughts that would otherwise go on deaf ears, it now can be on blind eyes as well.  Iâ€™m just a normal person with thoughts on various subjects.  I have always enjoyed writing and I think the blog environment gives me a canvas to do just that.  It might be a bit odd to talk to a group of random people through an anonymous interface; however, it also allows a person to just talk without the worry of what others may think.  An anonymous sounding board if you will.  Although, this may not be true in many instances, i.e, someone starting a blog to become an Internet Idol, this is not the case for me.  I simply like an archived place where I can go back and just let the people I care about in my life know how I am doing.  If a random bloke (or blokette) decides to read my random drivels, then more power to them!  Anyway, I guess I have blabbered about nothing long enough.  I look forward to exploring this interface a bit further to see if it will fulfill my Internet rambling needs.
