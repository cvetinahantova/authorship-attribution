i can't believe jammi and i just did what we shouldn't have! we both found it weird actually. but, hey, it felt as good as before. he even taught me how to tune my guitar and one chord progression. i can play a bit already. i'm planning to learn "one and only you" the hidden track in parokya ni edgar's latest album. i wanna let jammi hear it... i miss him so much and he misses me, too.  i love him...i wonder if he loves me, too...
