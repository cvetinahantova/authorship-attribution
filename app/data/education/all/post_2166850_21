hi to everybody reading this blog!!! my fave song now is  alicia keys -- if i aint got you ...here are the lyrics:   Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power yeah Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things Define what's within I've been there before But that life's a bore So full of the superficial  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you  Some people search for a fountain Promises forever young Some people need three dozen roses And that's the only way to prove you love them  And in a world on a silver platter And wondering what it means No one to share, no one who truly cares for me  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you  If I ain't got you with me baby Nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing If I ain't got you with me baby   if my blog is still playing  craig david 's song, then its not updated yet.... school is ok, for the first week of term 2....im juz feeling a bit out of knack for the moment, with a bad cough and a running nose....*sniffle* and caron, if u are reading this, i would like to know the details of your 'kaa holl etcetc.' youth outreach thing on april 9th coz my frenz arent sure if they can make it....email me k? and i need the name too.... any way, i'll be back with a new entry the next time....arrivederci....
