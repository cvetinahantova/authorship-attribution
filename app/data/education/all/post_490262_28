I watched the Awards last night (like everyone else, apparently) and thought they were just OK.  Was it just me or was Whoopi not very funny?  That could be the exhaustion talking.  Yes, it was another fun day where I got to work, pick up the baby, go straight to the pediatrician's office, then the pharmacy and then home.  The little guy is still sick.  Now he has an ear infection so I'll be taking another day off work to stay home with him tomorrow.  I think his babysitter was a little pissed that I dropped him off today.  She said he cried all day.  I feel badly about that but I really didn't think he was that sick this morning.  Yesterday he was OK, not 100% but alright so...  OK, laundry, clean the kitchen, call the babysitter, then maybe (cross your fingers for me) a hot bath and a bad novel.
