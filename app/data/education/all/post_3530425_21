So, yesterday, Tuesday, I'm talking to Amy in the evening, and I suddenly remember that I had an appointment with Therapist Man.  The air was blue with the swearing.  It costs me $55 to miss an appointment, and I just don't have that kind of money to flush.  Turns out, I didn't make the appointment for Tuesday, I made it for Wednesday.  Of course!  I have Gabriel on Tuesdays -- Wednesday made much more sense.  So I remembered that I hadn't forgotten the appointment.  Until 4:45 today.  When I remembered.  The appointment.  Which was for 5:00 at an office probably 45 minutes away in rush hour traffic.  Therapist Man called my cell phone, poolside, and we had our appointment there by phone.  Only a $15 co-payment.  Phew.  He didn't understand either when I tried to explain that I forgot the appointment I remembered I hadn't forgotten.  It's a blonde thing.
