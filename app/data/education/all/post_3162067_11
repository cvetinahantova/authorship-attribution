I'm feeling quite nervy and panicked lately. It feels like there's so much to do, and just not enough time. I have so many things I want to do, but I never have time to do them. Drawing, reading, socialising, embroidery, writing (I have about 5 books and 3 short stories I want to write). It is making me feel extremely frustrated and panicky. I know this is largely because of my teaching i.e. I can never do much at the weekend, or relax, because I know I have a lot of planning and marking to do. So glad I'm leaving, but now the transition time is starting, and everything is so unsure. Can't seem to keep still. On Friday I went into town and a starling flew onto my shoulder. I don't know who was more shocked: it or me. It sat on my shoulders for a few seconds, staring at me, then it began to squawk. It looked very annoyed. After a few minutes, it flew away. Daft thing.
