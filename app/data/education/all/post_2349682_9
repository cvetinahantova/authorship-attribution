Tonight in my educational psychology class I realized that some people are just so mean! We did a presentation last week on  different types of disorders I had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the other three girls had RAD, ADD, and ADHD. We did a game as kind of an icebreaker, it didn't really relate to what we were talking about but it was fun. So anyways, we get our evaluation/critique from our fellow classmates, it was funny because one person said that the game had nothing to with the presentation so that was distracting, another person said that me and my friend weren't dressed professional enough, (I had on nice jeans a nice shirt but I was wearing my jacket sorry but I get cold, I shouldn't have to explain or justify my actions) I think it is just silly though one person said that we were looking at the power point too much and that we didn't know how to spell. I don't know what kind of mood some people were in that night but seriously, how hurtful! I mean we are supposed to be building each other up, encouraging one another, not breaking our spirits and tearing us down. My group members were ready to go in the class and see who said those things, they started talking bad about the people who wrote those things, I couldn't join in because I knew that would be wrong too, I tried to be like hey guys it's just a couple of people. I just want to pray for those people instead of getting angry. Lord, if I have offended someone in my class or have done something that they didn't like forgive me. I pray for the people who said hurtful things to our group, Father I pray that you will give them an extra dose of your love. Let them know that regardless of their actions or words they are still precious in your eyes.
