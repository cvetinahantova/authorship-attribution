[Feel free to use this letter as a template. It is a simple matter to copy and paste the  urlLink theater addresses  to your Bcc: line and mass mail a single message.] Dear theater representative,   I am aware that significant pressure is being placed on you by a Republican-aligned consulting group and its supporters not to show Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11 .    I commend you for your showing this controversial, esteemed, and much-anticipated movie. It would be an insult to the American public to deny them the use of their own judgment in such a matter as film-going.   Thank you.
