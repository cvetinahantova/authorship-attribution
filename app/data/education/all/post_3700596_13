When I was asked to create this blog I thought that it was just another way of creating lots of data, in a self satisfying way and was not very keen. Then I went through a process of dealing with my defenses and started thinking that it was a great tool and started putting all sorts on the site.  This led to lots of stuff which reminded me of the research that one of our tutors at University used to refer to, conducted by  urlLink George A. Miller , which can be located  urlLink Here . This research seemed to indicate that complexity decreases a human beings ability to absorb data unless the number of elements being handled is kept at around seven. I have always used this number when teaching people about design principles to control the level of detail at a given level of design. A little guidance for abstraction if you like.  Now with WebLogs there exists the possibility that we destroy what we are creating as we create it, by introducing too many elements to go back and deal with the creation adequately.  Then I came across RSS which is one of the XML dialects for siphoning web feeds into other web feeds. Then I read on this site that it is 'fixed' but out of date and work is now progressing on a development initiative called atom which is to be the future RSS .....  To cut a long story short, if you find yourself hunting around Weblogs by typing in the URLS manually, then get and install  urlLink Sharpreader.net  it is a free tool which you can use to subscribe to sites that display the RSS or XML icons. Or those that the Weblog service provider ensures are available in a compatible format, like this site :-)
