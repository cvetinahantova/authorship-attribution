Monday madness   Everything is crazy at work... The machines won't recognize their network cards, or they will recognize them but not start them on bootup, or they'll start them on bootup and they won't work... And then it turns out that the switch wants an IP address... And it even gets offered one by the dhcp server, but nooo, it won't grab that one, it'll just go on sending out dhcprequests.
