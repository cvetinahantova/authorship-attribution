Everyday is silent and grey by Scott  This Sunday I went to check up on Morrisey, the little baby orangutan whose birth I witnessed. He's doing great, and has already learned to use leafy branches as fly swatters. Morrisey was only out in the morning, then he was snatched up by a zookeeper and put somewhere else. Apparently his name is 'Cuckoo." I found this to be revolting, or simply the product of some dumb kid winning the naming contest. Lest I forget, zoos are for kids, not twenty six year olds with an unhinged social contract. Anyway here's some  urlLink more stuff .
