Been a pretty cool week really, school is much better and I'm enjoying the slow wind down (or up) to Christmas.  Was a dreadful teacher on Friday though and spent much of my Y7 lesson telling bad jokes.  an example: What was Agricola?  A early Roman soft drink brought to Britain in little red cans (historical explanation - Agricola was actually the first Roman Governer of Britain.  Its not big or clever I know but I just couldn't resist it.  Oh dear, tweed jackets with elbow patches seem closer than ever.  Had a lot of fun on Thursday at 24hr Parking.  All the bands were good but it was brilliant to see Baby Ingrid again.  So impressive!  Well done guys.   After Expression last night (very good) I went out with my work mates to a few bars and then to the Leadmill.  Was a good laugh and spent most of the night dancing.  But dum Ben lost his cloakroom ticket so is now sans coat.  To make it worse I put my mobile in the coat thinking " That will be safer there".  So not only am I jacketless but also (once again) without mobile communication.  Maybe I should just give up on the mobile front.  Still, other than that a fun night out.  5 days to the holidays!
