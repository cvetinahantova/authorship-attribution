It sssssssssssoooooo wasn't bad!   In fact, it was downright fantabulous. I am now a certified eucharistic minister! i was already a lector, but now i'm doubly a lector. i appreciate the mass and services so much more now that i understand them.   and the people, whoah! they were completely normal! i didn't find one jesus freak kid!!! and hear you me, there was some nice scenery out there if you know what i mean. me and the girls decided that hgtv needed to check out starving artist, angry celloist, and a guy with some great garden tools. 2% body fat! aaarrrgh!!! and then there were those hillarious guys u always laugh at. i sat in on some rocktastic jam sessions. oohhh, and I learned to play a beat on the drums!!!  i liked the music we played @ HYU a helluva lot better than the stuff at St. Peter's and STA. It was more upbeat and fun! (Short! 5ive! Elbow!)and I was in luv with our skits!! I got to be an angry yelling manager and the devil inviting HYU attendees to a party!!! Jesus (Hayzoos) rox my sox! Ok, enough for now, must do laundry and get ready for Super Sleuth camp tomorrow.
