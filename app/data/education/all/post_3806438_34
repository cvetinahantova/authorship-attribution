The Mets made two terrible trades at the trade deadline this year, even after  urlLink I advised them not to .  They went through with that trade of Ty Wigginton and Matt Peterson for Kris Benson.  Benson got shelled in his first start as a Met, though we'll give him a pass because his last three starts were against the Braves.  On top of that they traded their best pitching prospect, Scott Kazmir, to the Devil Rays for Carlos Zambrano, a guy who's abou as good as Benson.  The Mets must be looking toward the future because their chances for this year are essentially zero after falling 8 games behind the Braves last night.  If they sign both of these guys for the next 3 or 4 years then they will remain a middle of the road team, which is what they seem to be content to do.
