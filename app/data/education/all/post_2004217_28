Well! Today has been a  p a r t i c u l a r l y   interesting day. Went for an interview with Marks and Spencer today... passed the first interview section (lots of questions about teamwork and problem solving) and passed the second interview section (practical task)... Which means I got the job! Wahey!   Then I found out I should have brought 2 forms of ID with me, a passport photo and an application form. Do I have any of these with me? Nooo, because my confirmation letter did not arrive until this morning,  after    I had left the house. Great.  Then! They checked their Christmas vacancy timetable and there were no vacancies for me! So I spent an hour in some back corridor of M&S Walsall, only to end up in exactly the same position as I was beforehand. Woo fucking hoo.  Although I did get a reply from Gaz- he says he'll try and come out next week, which means I have to try and persuade mother dearest to let me go into town 2 weeks on the trot. Which should be a whole barrel of laughs. Liz even suggested I took him to see Hundred Reasons with me! This is all very interesting, it's like she's trying to tell me that I  should  go out with him. Which is nice. :o)  So all in all, it's been a bad icky blergh day, so I'm going to drown myself in my playlist and get on with what looks like the hardest German homework   e v e r . I'll post more later.  Wishes she was at a show Ceff x
