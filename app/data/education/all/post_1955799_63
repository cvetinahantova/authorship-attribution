Time flies, and I forget to post, or at least get caugut up in some mad ish.    I am so late or an entry.  it looks like I've abandoned all entries.  No, just working on a writing project that is not done, will be worked on tonight, and I'll have it completed by the 20th.  That is my projected date to submit the writing.  Who knew it would be so detailed, and I would be so wrapped up in the material.    I'm on abbreviated time, so I have to close up in about ten minutes.  I did want to post, and will post again soon.
