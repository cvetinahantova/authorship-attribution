so life sux as normal.  I will post it here my problem to all of everything.     I might b moving schools and house!   I could be going to a boarding school in september which meens i will be leaving all my cool and friendly friends and i might just burst into tears right here in my latin lesson. It will b so hard but a new expirience all the same.   Damn I need to go now cos i hav to concerntrate for once.  Otherwise i might fail my exam and i can't do that if i wanna get into a good school.  Taraa
