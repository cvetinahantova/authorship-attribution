Another inane Amazon customer review - this one for a CD that will not be released until SEPTEMBER 2004  "Christine McVie Rocks!!!" says Reviewer Chris from USA on April 15    Obviously, the record has not come out yet, but it will be great. I would bet my life on it. Afterall, has Christine ever written a bad song? I don't think so! As a valuable member of Fleetwood Mac for 25 years, Christine has defined herself as a classy, talanted pop-rock artist. This is sure to be her best work yet! We are so lucky that she is releasing this and is not being dismissed as an old rocker. Christine can rock harder then any of the young people of today and one can only hope she'll have a hit song and will prove that she is the queen of pop!
