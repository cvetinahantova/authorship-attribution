It is completely uncivilised to be out of bed before 9am on a Sunday morning. But there are essays and other important things to be done. It is too depressing. In my Western Isles childhood, this would've been blasphemy.  But! Let's look at some stats to up morale a bit:   TWO DAYS of school left.  Thanks to training day at New Job tomorrow. Eep!   FOUR DAYS until big official last hand in  With Friday being what Rob rather charmingly terms 'a buffer day'. This isn't entirely good news.   THE WHOLE OF JULY  Is given as a grace period to finish taking our Skills Tests. Yay!   EVERY BAR IN LONDON  is at my disposal from Thursday onward. Note to self: drinking to excess is neither big nor clever.  Right then. I suppose I'd better get on with it. x  ETA: Oh for the love ... it is now almost eight thirty AT NIGHT and I have done nothing. Literally. Think of what I could have achieved in the last twelve hours. Bloody hell. I am a big fat failure. Thankfully there is still Pimm's, so I am less concerned about this than perhaps I should be.  Dammit it IS the bloody Calvinists! That or the fact that I am bone idle. *gibbers*
