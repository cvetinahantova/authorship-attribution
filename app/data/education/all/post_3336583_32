Today was the first official day for teachers to report to work. It was great to see everyone again. We have some new people on staff and they all seem really nice. I spent the majority of my day in meetings but did get to go out to lunch with 16 of my colleagues. My "mentee", Keri, is really excited about starting the school year. She had her first experience with the laminating machine today...no major problems, just a few pieces that will need to be relaminated! Keri is so sweet and is going to be a great addition to our team!       I am in the process of updating my links. I have added a new blog,   urlLink  All Kinds of Everything   . My friend  urlLink Natalie  introduced me to this blog. Natalie and I went to college with Mary. It's a great read so check it out!
