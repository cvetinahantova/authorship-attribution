Its been a slow one.  I was gonna go watch Spidey 2, but my friend wanted to watch Ecuador play in the Copa America instead... so we postponed till cheap Tuesday :)  Saturday I spent most of the later morning and earlier afternoon helping some missionaries move in that returned to the field after a year away.  They were good friends of mine, and I'm very glad that they made it back before I left, although only by a few weeks (still not counting days).  Speaking of leaving... today I made a list of things I want to try and sell here before I go.  Not very much stuff, lol.  I've been trying to avoid accumulating stuff... and it looks like I may have succeeded.  I'm going to try and sell my guitar, but just so I don't have to carry it home... cuz that could be a pain.  If I can't sell it for near replacement value though... then I'll just bring it home.  Church was good this morning.  We didn't have the regular pastor, but a guest speaker, continuing our series on fruits of the Spirit with Gentleness.  I didn't feel like I learned a lot from this message, but there were a few things.  Oh, I wanted to look up a passage he quoted in 2 Samuel, where he equated helpfulness with gentleness (said it was the Hebrew equivalent to the Greek word for it).  I'll see if I can figure it out with e-sword.  Not much of a rap fan, but TBone's 'Raised In Harlem' is playing on  urlLink ChristianRock.net , and I like it.  This next week looks to be busy, and I'm sure things won't slow down much after that till I leave (and probably not for a while after that).  I may be going on another weekend excursion this coming weekend.  More on that later.
