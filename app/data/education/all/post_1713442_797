urlLink Harry S. Truman  This is a good biography of President Truman.  It is from  urlLink USA Presidents .  From the site:  Harry S . Truman ( May 8 , 1884 â€“ December 26 , 1972 ) was the thirty-fourth ( 1945 ) Vice President and the thirty-third ( 1945 - 1953 ) President of the United States , succeeding to the office upon the death of Franklin Roosevelt .    Truman's presidency was very eventful, seeing the end of World War II , the beginning of the Cold War , the formation of the United Nations , and most of the Korean War . Truman was a notoriously folksy president, issuing many famous phrases including "the buck stops here".    Harry S. Truman was born on May 8 , 1884 in Lamar, Missouri . When Truman was six years old, his parents moved the family to Independence, Missouri , and it was there that Truman would spend the bulk of his formative years. After graduating from high school in 1901 , Truman worked at a series of clerical jobs before he decided to become a farmer in 1906 , an occupation in which he remained for another ten years. (He was the last president to not have a college degree.)    With the onset of American participation in World War I , Truman enlisted in the National Guard , was chosen to be an officer, and then commanded a regimental battery in France . At the war's conclusion, Truman returned to Independence and married his long-time love interest, Bess Wallace , and they would have one child, Margaret, shortly thereafter. Some claim that he was for a short time a member of the Ku Klux Klan, but this has not been verified.
