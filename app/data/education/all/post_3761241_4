The greatest invention in the world is one that any given person would say, "Ah, why didn't I think of that?" Some people say it's the washing machine, some people say it's the remote control, or the automobile, and others would say it's the computer. I'd say that these are all very good inventions, but to me, and at this moment, I'd say the greatest invention in the world was the pacifier. You know, those sucky things that shut babies up? Yes, well, you see, at this very moment, while my brother is having one of his temper tantrums, the only thing that allows you to get just that single moment of silence you need is the pacifier. There are a few purposes to the pacifier:  a) it sends a message: shut up. b) it sends a false message: oh look! It's food! Why don't you just shut up? c) it keeps the baby busy: it allows them to suck on something besides the remote control you want to use to see the game on T.V.  Now the irony to the situation is, after you use the pacifier yourself, it gets kind of addictive. Really.  So who said pacifiers weren't suitable for all ages?
