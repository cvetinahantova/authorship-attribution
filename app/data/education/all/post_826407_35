" It's been malled.   It's the upshot of some dumb decision that to compete with them�to compete with N'Sync and Friends and Stephen King and Matt and Katie and Abercrombie & Fitch and Jackie Chan and AOL and Sesame Street�the faithful should turn from their centuries-old tradition of fashioning transcendent art and literature and passionate folk forms such as gospel music and those outsider paintings in which Jesus has lime green bat wings and is hovering lovingly above the Pentagon flanked by exactly thirteen flying saucers, and instead of all that head down to Tower or Blockbuster and check out what's selling, then try to rip it off on a budget if possible and by employing artists who are either so devout or so plain desperate that they'll work for scale."  The quote is from a very interesting and thought provoking  urlLink article   by Walter Kirn, GQ's literary editor, on Christian subculture.     I found this on  urlLink Jonny Baker's blog , an always inspiring site that I regularly pinch things from.
