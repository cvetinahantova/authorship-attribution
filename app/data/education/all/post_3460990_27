Last night, around 11 pm, I opened my email to find an invitation to interview at 10 this morning with one of the three follow-up schools.   After a long wait and a short interview with a very assertive principal, I got the job!  I'll be teaching English to either 7th or 8th grade at K291 in Bushwick, Brooklyn.I'm still researching the school to be as prepared as possible for September, but what I do know is that they have a stong emphasis on the arts, and that appeals to me a lot.   Hopefully, I'll be able to get involved with some aspect of extra-curricular activities before school even starts. They have a drama group, dance team, and band. I'm very excited to get started.
