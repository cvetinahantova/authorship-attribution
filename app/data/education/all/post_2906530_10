In response to john (a fellow blogger of mine) I wholeheartedly agree with his views on gang culture where i think the problem lies in this case would be from the rolemodels Footballers are an example of this. they are constantly in the public eye, and the way they behave on the pitch (not respecting the authority of the referee in this case) Is a major step in the wrong direction and gives football and our over passionate fans a bad name. Im not trying to stick up for football as i am not a fan of it. but a lot of the burden of this problem needs to fall there.
