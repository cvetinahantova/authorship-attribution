I went to the whole night of prayer at Church for a little bit on Friday.  We were singing  urlLink Amazing Grace  its an awesome personal story of God's redemtive work in a former slave trader's life.  But the last verse made me think...   When we�ve been there ten thousand years, Bright shining as the sun, We�ve no less days to sing God�s praise Than when we�d first begun.   It's great to look forward to an eternity with God, the trouble is I often dismiss it as a future thing.  A glory that is to come.   But I want to live out my life now.  I want to see God's kingdom grow here.  I want to see the sick healed, the oppressed freed, the hungry fed, the hurt comforted; in my world.  I want to work for heaven now, not dream of one day being there.  And I suspect that my dream is in line with God's, and that he's already doing just that.
