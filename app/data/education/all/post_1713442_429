urlLink Filial Therapy. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Brandy Schuman.  It discusses the concept of filial therapy.  From the ERIC Digest:  Many children do not have their need for emotional nurturing met (Landreth, 2002). Communication gaps between parents and children may exist because many parents are unaware of their children's emotional needs and lack the skills necessary to interact effectively with them on an emotional level (Landreth, 2002). Children communicate through play (Axline, 1969; Landreth, 2002). It is their innate language. By teaching parents the language of play, and how to use play therapeutically, the communication gap between parent and child can be closed (Guerney, Guerney, & Andronico, 1999; Landreth, 2002).    Filial therapy is an alternative method for treating emotionally disturbed children in which the parent is used as an ally in the therapeutic process. The parent becomes the child's primary therapeutic agent (Guerney, et. al. 1999; Landreth, 2000; VanFleet, 2000). Parental involvement in a child's developmental process facilitates the parent's motivation to continue sessions and thus tends to eliminate the typical parental resistance that is encountered when the parent is not involved in the child's therapy.
