hey everyone,  well considering it is monsoon season i really haven't had to deal with much  rain.  knock on wood.  however yesterday i did get stranded at a friends  place for a couple of hours.  the rain here is different than in  mississippi.  it comes down very hard and very fast.  it rarely drizzles or  mists all day long like it does for days and sometimes weeks in ms.  every  time it happens i'm always without my umbrella.  i've just got to start  carrying it eveywhere with me.  other than that not much to say.  i just found out two days ago that i do  have to give summative exams.  just another example of how disorganized the  school is.  so now i'm stuck in the computer room all day making an exam for  a class that i have only taught once.  crazy nuns.  well one more thing i've started to notice about myself is that some of the  things that amazed me a first in thailand are now either annoying or passe.   for example on silom rd. i often see elephants hanging out with their  handlers at first i was amazed, then i was told that the elephants are  mistreated and that it is bad for them to be in the middle of a busy ,  pollution filled street.   so now i feel sorry for them.  anyway... gotta  run.  tests to be made.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar Â get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/
