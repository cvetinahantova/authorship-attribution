Hmmmm back to school again.  In Creative Writing we're doing our final project, which will be our choice so long as it involves the written word. I sent in my proposal for a music-based short story, and I had something planned but then I tried explaining it to a friend and I realized how stupid it sounded. Really typical, like something with graduated High Schoolers and a touch of the movie, "A Walk to Remember." Of course I would have given it my own flare, but now I just don't like the idea anymore.  Spanish was okay. We started a food unit and hopefully we'll get to eat some actual food. The movie we watched was kind of disgusting, with them gutting fish and whipping themselves at Passover down there in Mexico. But I kind of liked the movie, only because we are going to have a test on it and the movie was in English (=easy notes).   Algrebra sucked, as usual. We split up into new groups, which also sucked because I liked my old seat in front of Cory and next to Amanda and behind the dude with the big head. Then we did a ton of dittos on linear equations...which was totally and completely boring. Grrrr. Guitar was same old same old. Not good, not bad. I got a hug from Kevin, so it made me feel a little better.  Track was okay. Got a meet this Wednesday. Whooo (*lack of enthusiasm*).
