urlLink Library Journal Movers & Shakers  Know anyone who is real leader in librarianship that lives in the USA or Canada?  If so, check out this page at  Library Journal .  You can nominate the person to be one of the 50 recognized for 2004.  The page reads, "The editors of Library Journal need your help in identifying the emerging leaders in the library world. Our third annual Movers & Shakers supplement will profile 50 up-and-coming people from across the U.S. and Canada who are innovative, creative, and making a difference.  Now more than ever, librarians are creating ground-breaking services and collections for their users. But too often the people behind these exciting projects remain out of sight, known only to their peers.   Movers & Shakers 2004 will profile people in every sector: school, public, and academic librarians; those working in public and technical services; new managers, systems gurus, and collections visionaries, both MLS librarians and other library workers. We will also identify those outside librarianship who are having an impact on libraries: vendors who have created innovative solutions to enhance services; publishers that work creatively with librarians to encourage reading; and trustees that are a model of leadership. Unlike lifetime achievement awards, those nominated for Movers & Shakers 2004 should be in their early or mid-careers."
