One person has already been vastly amused by this evening's adventures, so now  I'll share them with the rest of you.  It all started because...I was on call.  My phone rang, and it was the RA from the other building.  A resident smelled gas in her room, and couldn't figure out where it was coming from.  I went over, and quickly discovered that her window was open.  The window that looks out upon the parking lot.  Where there are cars.  That have gas in them.  Right.  Back to my building.  I walked in to some students telling me that they had been stuck in the elevator.  I went to make out of order signs, and before I could put them up, someone else got into the elevator, and of course they got stuck, too.  We got them out, and had security turn off the breaker to the elevator, so that no one else would ride in it.    Then I had to go back over next door to confront a student about a fight.  Of course, that student was no where to be found, and I spent twenty minutes looking for her, to no avail.   Finally, I came back to my building, where I ended up having to talk to an RA about a problem that was brought to my attention.  After over two hours of running around, I finally got back to my room.  Two more days until vacation...I can make it.  On a good note, upon my return, I was informed that perfection has now reached the Internet.  See for yourself at www.georgespohr.com .  Who could ask for anything more?  ;-)
