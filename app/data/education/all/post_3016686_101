and her artsy fartsy media blitz has begun...   urlLink     You can hear two new  Medulla  tracks courtesy of BBC's  urlLink Breezeblock . They play "The Pleasure Is All Mine" at about 19:18 and "Mouth's Cradle" at about 20:49. Note you can fast forward to the tracks. "Pleasure" is very challenging - the melody is hard to detect, if it's there at all. "Mouth's Cradle" is a bit more traditionally Bjorkian and the voices mimic instruments. Remixes please! Tidbit:  Medulla  was recorded in  18 places .
