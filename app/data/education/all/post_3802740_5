One thing about the Blogging world that I have yet to comprehend is the comments portion.  How does one go about receiving their initial comments?  Do they spam their blogger address to all their friends and family in hopes for a comment, or does some random internet person, who happens to find your blogger interesting, leave a comment?  The only reason I wonder this is because I often log in to check my blog just to be disappointed with 0 comments on a post.      Now, I don’t send my link to people I know in hopes for such a happening, but I check in hopes that one random person out there might find this place interesting enough to make a comment on it.  Shrug, its just one of the major appeals of the internet.  You never know who is reading your site or what they think, so it provides them a place for feedback, which may be nothing more than an “I agree” type post.     Or maybe they make posts like this that encourage others to post their comments, thus initiating the anonymous comment ring.  For instance, if someone left a comment, I’d be interested in checking out their blog and would possibly leave a comment there.  From there, someone might read my comment and see my blog and the ring continues.  Interesting isn’t it?  Yeah, I didn’t think so either.
