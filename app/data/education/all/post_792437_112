To top it all off..    Â  Suppose I really did it. Suppose it's a bit late to be online at this time, as it's 3:34 a.m! Yikes! Just been a nice day for me I guess. Didn't do much but go on a walk, eat, talk, shop, and clean (haha, as I ever do that) but I cleaned a car.  I bought a car this past friday. Amazingly nice. Got the best deal for it, and it is a 2003 Honda Civic EX. The color of it is called NightHawk Black. But I guess it looks black to me. It has anything I could possibly ask for in a car. The best part of the car, is the thing I saw when I actually drove it myself. It has amazingly cool blue chrome dials, which light up. Kind of a sporty look to the car, but at the same time it adds spice.  So now I wonder, as the topic of this message says "to top it all off." I've had ambitions of doing and buying things myself. I started out small, and my goal was to keep building. I went from small things to a laptop, to now a car. What's next? I was thinking, and I think it'll be a house. I suppose I'll probably buy the house at least 4-5 years down the road, but we'll see how that goes once I get to Purdue University.
