FIRST OF ALL. Before I start my rant...Let me just get out of the way how grateful I am for everyone's help.  From the really big stuff to the small, little stuff, I could not make this journey possible without the help you have provided.   However...   It's is funny what you come to realize in times of need.  What I am about to say is merely an observation and is credible in no way.  Here lately, getting ready for my trip and all, I have been in situations and circumstances that are making me vulnerable.  I don't like to need anyone.  I would like to think that I can do it by myself without help.  I just don't want to put anyone out.    Anyway, it has been really surprising to me what people's reactions are.  To get the closest people in my life to help me is like pulling teeth...I have to practically beg for their help.  But outside of those people..Everyone is offering their assistance in any way that they can.   The only reason I am even bringing this up is because I am astounded how many people are offering to help me.  From Europeans to old friends to just acquaintances...They all are making it really clear that they would love to help me in the special way that they can.  And a lot have already done it.    Why? If nothing else than to figure out human behavior.  Why are these people not wanting to even acknowledge that I am going?
