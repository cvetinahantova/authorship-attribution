I am looking forward to the new Wembley stadium being finished.  This is not because I have suddenly become a fan of football (I haven't), but I spent the weekend in Swansea and came back on the train yesterday evening. Yesterday was also the day of the "Charity Shield" match between Arsenal and Manchester United, held in the millenium stadium in Cardiff. The match kicked off at 3pm and was finished by 4:45pm, quite a bit of time before I passed through at 7:30pm. Through the vaguaries of Great Western's pricing, I'd also managed to book a   first class ticket for about the same price as standard class. Between Swansea and Cardiff, tickets were checked. However, once we got to Cardiff the train filled up and there were passengers standing everywhere. Tickets weren't checked again, and I don't believe that most of the passengers that ended up in the carriage I was in had first class tickets. That may sound like snobbery, but travelling first class is supposed to mean something, and one of the things is a bit more room than in the rest of the train, but here I was with other passengers sitting in the aisle and even on the table in front of me. Almost like being back in Laos.  Apart from transport, there are other reasons to be less than fanatical about the UK at the moment.  Today's  Evening Standard , not a paper I generally read, has a story about  urlLink foreigners being questioned on the tube . I'm suprised this isn't a policy that the Standard supports, but if it is true and not just another example of poor reporting in the Standard, I find it appalling. Yet another instance of the creeping, or rather galloping, authoritarianism in this country.  Next year marks the  urlLink 200th anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar .
