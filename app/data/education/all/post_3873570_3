Today was a day that I wished at many times would end. I wish I could just disappear, so I didn't have to feel or think certain things. The only moment that I seemed to be ok was when I saw Teesa. I was on the verge of crying when I arrived to pick her up. The reason was absolutely stupid: just listening to a cd made me feel incredibly sad about being an Argentinean... then I thought about my dad and his disease...what if the only positive figure in my family dies?...why? yes he's abused tobacco forever, but why would it happen? My mind was racing kind of continuing with yesterday's thoughts.        Somehow, little by little Teesa (with her powers) managed to make me      forget for a while and we had a nice time. After I left her at her house, anguish came back. Maybe I'm pmsing badly, and I try to find a logical explanation when there's none. During the evening I texted Teesa and she helped me feel a little better. At around 8 I called her without anything to say. I hate those times, because I feel I am boring her to death and I called just to pass time. I like when we engage in interesting topics and after talking I feel: wow that was nice... When I am so negative I can never have engaging conversations. why? I wanted to talk some more, I was hungry for one of those conversations. Maybe Monday... if nothing happens so that plans are cancelled. I love my buddy, today my mood was such that I couldn't even tell her I loved her without feeling shy and out of place. Well, tomorrow has to be a better day...
