Sorry nothing interesting happened today. Work was fun. I worked tonight with my favorite closing team.  I have sooo much fun closing the store at nights. When I got bored at work today, I just played ball with the new photo guy... He is really cute! But he is getting married next month.  Doesn't really matter anyways, I aint looking.. Boys are bad! Well that is pretty much it. I love you guys! Loves Sheila
