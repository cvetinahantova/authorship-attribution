Well, as many know now, I didn't get the job. This is getting me down a little. I feel, to be frank, a big useless lump. I need job security. It's difficult to remember right now how exhausted teaching made me feel.  The house is a tip, the animals smell...I think I'm turning into poor white trash. All I need to do now is bring in the patio furniture and I'm set.
