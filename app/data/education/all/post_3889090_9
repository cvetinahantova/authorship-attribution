OK, I need to take some steps to achieving my goal of ultimate happiness. I need to go for my best option at his point which is direct communication with God. I will speak to God if he exists and ask for either an unnatural manipulation of the ordinary, or some kind of response to my attempts to communicate with him. I'll give it a few days. Hmmm - How long should I go though... I'll try wait for a week.
