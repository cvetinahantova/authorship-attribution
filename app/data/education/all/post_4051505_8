discovered my arms got all sunburnt yesterday...it was 'fun' trying to sleep lastnight when every time i rolled over my arms stung like mad...i swear half my skin peeled off onto the sheets...nice. so anyway, today it's nice and dull and boring and grey and british...and this morning i got woken up by some stupid dog howling in a garden somewhere, which set off the whole town's dogs, so by the time i'd got out of bed there were at least 5 or 6 dogs howling and barking. i came downstairs to be greeted by the news that good old grandma's coming to stay for a week-oh, the fun. she arrives tomorrow or tuesday so i'm staying out with meg, j and sara all day every day. that woman is pure evil. i am not staying in a house with her all week, and then having visits to the occasional garden center. nope, that is not my fate. no way. i'm going to enjoy that week. i'm determined. so anyway, expect a lot of angry, grandmother-hating, stressed out blogs in the next week cos she's going to be here and she's going to be driving me crazy. grr. phrase for the day: I'M BURNT, TIRED AND BORED AND SOME STUPID OLD WOMAN IS COMING TO LIVE IN MY HOUSE FOR A WEEK...I'M NOT HAPPY!
