urlLink  Which HP Kid Are You?     Nah, what I really wanted to get was Fred/George. But I really didn't like the fifth book, it seemed like it was really unorganized. Not to mention the fact that the most used word in Order of the Phoenix was "Said". He said, she said, it said, we said, they said. SAID! My favorite part was when Fred and George bust outta Hogwarts. Anyways...
