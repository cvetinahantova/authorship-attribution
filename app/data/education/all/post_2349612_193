so today i got the third email in a week from one of my hungarian friends telling me what they're up to and asking p.s. so when do you think you'll come visit budapest again... you can stay with me!  i miss budapest... i want to go back... i found round trip tickets for this summer for $650ish (including tax... $550ish flat rate).... i soooo want to go back... both eric and rooommate told me this is a bad idea when i don't have a summer job and am $10,000ish in debt... roommate promised to come with me next summer though... dude.  i miss hungary... why does it cost soo much to go back?  almost time for friends and apprentice... joy.... and 1 lie groups problem done... double joy... dinner time... later dudes.
