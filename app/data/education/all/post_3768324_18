I'm almost finished with my classroom as of Thursday afternoon. Additionally, I've created a "Contest Corner" on one wing of JW Oates, allowing students and teachers to see contests open to elementary school students.  Innvoations this year - current events bulletin board, larger space for displaying student work, more tableclothes.  There's some odd, or perhaps not odd in the least, self-absorption at my school. I asked a few people to help me with things around my room today, and no one did. I ended up spending about 4 hours getting all this crap together, a time that probably could have been shaved to 2.5 hours if people had been willing to help. I understand, it was just sad.  I'm not really sure how to feel about this year, but I think I should wait to consider that notion until at least Saturday, when my girlfriend finishes MCATs. For now, I'll say I'm not digging waking up early or contemplating all the work ahead of me.  I haven't gotten fully hyped about college or pro football this year, nor have I really been following baseball, except for day-old results in the Chronicle. In many respects, I feel like a failure as a sports fan, but I still argue Georgia vs. LSU is the centerpiece game of the upcoming college football season, and the Cowboys will suck. Texans and Redskins will both be 8-8, and I have no idea who will win the Super Bowl (Patriots?).
