I went home to see my family. It isn't too often that the four of us are in the same place simultaneously; my dad is 93. He doesn't travel well (although he does have his moments; i.e.: hitting up a casino at 12am and leaving at 5am). He didn't know who I was when I arrived; it took him a half-hour to figure out that his son was talking to him. He said it was because I wear glasses now; mind you my voice nor the oblong shape of my head haven't changed in the last six months. My dad didn't recognize me.  It is difficult to watch him whither....this man who taught me to build sidewalks and reinforce doorframes, as well as fiscal responsibilty and moral character. The emotions invading my head are not exclusive to me; rather, they are commonplace to most humans. My mother was my age when her mother stopped recognizing her (alzheimer's). Losing your parent(s) is nearly the hardest time for a person (a parent who has lost a child would object to that sediment).  I read over this entry, and it seems disjointed; aprapos, most certainly.  __________________________________________________________   current song: "signals over the air" - Thursday current mood: Dark, ominous, and searching
