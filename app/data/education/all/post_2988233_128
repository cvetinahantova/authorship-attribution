I am feeling alot better except for the aforementioned golf balls that have taken up residence where my tonsils used to be.    Tommy traded days off so he is home today, not feeling very well,his is allergies.    NOt much has happened around here mainly because we have all been to sick to get into any trouble.    Hope all you are doing good.
