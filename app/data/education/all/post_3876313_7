No longer an embryo, we now have a little fetus. Our baby is now 3/4 inches long. From what I have read, this is where we are so far.   The embryonic tail is disappearing, and the eyelids cover its eyes. The fingers and toes are growing longer but they are still slightly webbed. The arms have lengthened and the hands are now flexed at the wrist and meet over its heart. The knee joints have formed, and the feet may be long enough to meet in front of its body. The trunk is straightening out, and so the head is more erect. Breathing tubes extend from the throat to the branches of developing lungs. The nerve cells in the brain are also branching out to connect with one another, forming neural pathways.   Truly amazing, there is no doubt this is God's creation.
