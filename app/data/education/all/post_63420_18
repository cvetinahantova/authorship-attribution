If you have read any tech news source lately (last few days) you probably noticed that Google recently purchased  urlLink Picasa  , a program for organizing graphics on your own PC.   I noticed it, explored and installed it (it's free) when I wanted to upload a picture for my last blog entry. Blogger gave me the option of downloading and installing Picasa and since it's free....   Of course, Google with all of its recent offerings and purchases (Orkut......GMail......Blogger......Picasa....???) is reminiscent of Microsoft a few years back trying to blanket the desktop software market. Only now with Google it's the Internet application market. Same users, different paradigm.   Follow all of the Google news (good and bad)  urlLink here .
