Thanks to my family for the pressies!  I didn't get anything from my friends or my boyfriend. I didn't ask for anything. I didn't want anything. And besides, what I did want was WAAAAAAAY out of their price range. A clarinet. Come on! They're like $200+.  What I got was cool anyway. I got a Gameboy SP, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Game (for it), Summer time Tigger, some bangles with my first initial, a skate T-Shirt, and a book. The book isn't that cool but oh well. I also got a giftcard. I used it in one go! I got a new skirt, new socks (curious george!), and a new pair of boxers! (Girl type.)  I can't wait untill the 10th. My 2 BEST friends are going to spend the night. This will be the first time Joey has ever spent the night, and the second time Tom has.  Lysie
