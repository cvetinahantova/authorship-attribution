It was very exciting to finally meet the parents and the kiddos that I will have this year at "Meet the Parents" last night.  They were all very sweet and welcoming.  I even got a Starbucks gift card already.  Yeah for nice, thoughtful parents!  All day before meet the parents I was working hard to get my room all set up.  We (the second grade team) just received the class lists the afternoon before so we had to work hard all day to label everything.    Other then that, I've been watching the opening to the Olympics, playing with Rocky, and counting the days till Dave gets back.  Stay tuned for more to come about school...  **Due to privacy laws I will never mention a child's name**
