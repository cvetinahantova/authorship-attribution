Well here i am....they say to always try something new...well here i am...this is pretty new to me...there is so much i wanna say but so much i dont wanna say i dont wanna be juged by the things i put here...but i think i juge myself more then anyones ever has...i dont no why i do that but i just do i guess its a self esteem thing... my life has humor..horror..depression..and as any girl relationship problems..thats somehing i dont think anyone will ever get passed unless u find "Mr.Right"..im sure he is out there...just not in this life time..theses days seem that every guy is the same and i only after one thing if i have to say it then you need to be shot..men are pigs (No Joke)... the thing is i havnt been in many relationships..but the one i was in...was better then nothing...i wouldnt ever tell anyone this because i try to lie to myself about it because i dont want it to be the truth but the guy i was seeing about 7months ago i honestly saw myself with him for the rest of my life..but what hell do i know im only 16...they always say (I Wanna Know Who The Hell They Are  Because They Are Always Wrong)you know when you fallin love...well i know i fell in love...but getting off this subject..because its something that really wasnt dealed with the right way... Anywhos...well humor theres something i can go on and on about...i think im a fun person i love making people laugh and i love laughing at myself...i will try anything almost once...becuase there is no need to go threw life being serious about every little thing and being uptigh isnt to fun either..you only get one life live it to the fullest... i no i am jumping around alot and changing the subject but like i said this is new to me i am not a very organized writer but i love to write....i am a very strange person...but lets really just go to the basics about me i am ashley i live in navarre florida (Should Have Been The First Thing On My Page) i am 16 years old..when i get out of high school i have big plans for myself i want to go into the navy and be a nurs or something kool like that because i like dealing with people i just dont like blood or needles for that matter...i guess you can say my biggest goal of all is getting out of navarre i honestly dont like it here much...except for the fact we have and almost perfect beach (To Many People)..but i can always find another beach... and for fiends i dont have many...(Its Kinda Sad But Funny)..there is one person i know i can always count on to be there for me and go to anytime i want..you no who u are POOKY..(lol)but i guess i have a few oter friends but besides that i got people i talk to and i guess thats better then noting.. well this is the beginning of something new...and i have so much to say but i think it will need to wait fo another day...
