OK - a sorta enhanced blog - being written now on the fascinating computer in my room, on the greatly amazing program that is "Notepad". I'm using it because it's stable, fast, and greatly suited to this simple task that is just writing a little text  that needs to be copied into the blogger site; perhaps complete with the odd  bold  or  italic  tag. This is a jaunty little bug-ridden PC, with lots and lots of crashes and far too much software. I've tried uninstalling some of it, but there has been no noticeable affect :(. It doesn't even seem to run  urlLink Freespace 2  anymore... Today I've done... not much. Watched a little Matrix reloaded this morning, messed around on the PC. The highlight of the day - until the evening anyway - was my amazing bi-weekly activity of mowing my nan's lawn. Despite the obvious benefit of a Â£6 weekly income, this activity is becoming more and more tedious; to the point that I nearly actively dread it every week. The dull monotony was alleviated slightly this week by the fact that it started raining - and I had to rush around and put the lawnmower away (I had finished with it, fortunately) and trim the edges really fast. I got really wet :( - especially running home. Well... that was all of my day - its dullness shown in the shortness of this log - and the fact that its main feature was about the weather. Hey! I am British! ;)
