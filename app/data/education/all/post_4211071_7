Second day of happiness... today many people came to take their exam's slips from the  exam room . I was among the one who came early morning. Besides, I still need to attend the economic's class. I guess that I just misjudged people by their looks and I am lucky that I didn't get any further far from mocking them. I am not good with strangers but this morning I just made few friends along my way... Thanks for having faith in me!     The first person that I had spoken to was  Atiqah . She was waiting outside the library and asked me regarding my results. Well, I don't really remember what her results were but I am praying for her success since she congratulate me for having 3 credits. Thanks gurl :) Then  Amni  congratulate me for having credit for P.O.A ...  Amin ?? He got only credit for science and he was so damn  sasak  with my results... heheh :) By the way, I was with  Sal  since the whole morning until I entered economic's class.   Before I could further up typing the next, here is my exam's statement results:    English - D7;   Malay - B3;   Maths - E8;   POA - C6;   Science - C6;   Economics - D7          -to be continued-
