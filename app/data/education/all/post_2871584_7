Since I last had a blog, blogger has severely limited their template options.  They didn't have tons of options to begin with, but now they are just pathetic.  And I hate them.  So this afternoon, I decided to find a new template to use.  I only had one absolute requirement:  I would not pay for a template.  I would find a free one.  Considering how many hundreds of free templates there are online, this didn't seem like such a tough requirement.  Oh, how wrong I was.  I think the problem was that I had a picture in my mind of what I wanted.  Therefore, logically, I couldn't find it.  So I ended up spending all night online, looking for blog templates and yet...I still have the exact same one.  Eh...at least there was an SVU marathon on while I was searching, so my time wasn't a total loss.    In better news, I leave for Mardi Gras in ONE WEEK!  I can't wait.  This is going to be a kick ass vacation.  :-D
