Helen and I went down to the excellent  urlLink Peace in the Park  festival in Endcliffe Park on Saturday.  It was put on in aid of Water Aid and  urlLink Assist .  4 different tents/stages did drum and bassy dance, world beats and dubby stuff, proper bands (punk, ska and a kind of jewish sounding jazz) and more acoustic stuff.  The variety meant that it was the perfect place to chill out (but a little damp).  As well as all this, and several stalls for campaigning, was a Healing Field, with lots of spiritual bits and bobs.  We were a little apprehensive about this but went to have a look anyway.  It was very peacefull and sunny.  Lots of different stuff from different people there (but no church sadly).  In the middle on a big old oak were a load of poems and quotes, including this...  Flame Dancing Spirit, come Sweep us off our feet and Dance us through our days. Surprise us with your rythms; Dare us to try new steps, explore New patterns and new relationships; Release us from old routines To swing in abandoned joy and Fearful adventure. And  in the intervals, rest us in your still centre, Amen.                              Ann Lewin  I loved it.  What an invocation of the Holy Spirit.  Thinking about getting involved for next year.
