Just a short rant today for I'm going oot. Dick and Dom in "da" bungalow is the most pathetic idea to appeal to children what is it?  It is 2 20 year olds acting like fools for 3 hours that seems like an eternity. One of their favorite activities is to go into public places and say "bogey" at different levels of noise to see what the reaction is. What is entertaining about that?! Its all in all a poorly conceived idea which seems like it was made by the makers of the tweenies trying to appeal to older viewers. I best not get started on the tweenies because I could go on forever.
