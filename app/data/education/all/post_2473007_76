Had this strange dream last night that I was on the steps of the Supreme Court building and this gigantic pig walked up on his hind legs and began to harass my two friends.  I could only take it so long.  I leapt onto his back and began to wrestle with him, all the while shouting derogatory pig terms like "slab of meat" and "pork rind".  I even pulled a Tyson and bit his ear, but he didn't flinch.  It finally came to it and I heaved him over my head and down the stairs, but he squealed and laughed till he landed on the sidewalk and I realized that this was no way to settle a dispute.  I called down to him and asked him if he wanted to debate political views with me on a national talk radio program...
