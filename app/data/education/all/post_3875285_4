Being the mother of children of such a wide age range is amazing! The Prince took a picture of Bobby when he was 5 or 6 sitting on the toilet. It's a nice picture, side view, and all you can see is the toilet and the pants around his ankles. He has always had this thing about the toilet. When it's his turn to take out the trash...in the bathroom; clean out the car...in the bathroom; wash dishes...in the bathroom.  It really frustrates his two younger brothers. Joey, aged 6, is also a throne sitter. We are currently remodeling our house. Wallpaper border just seems to stick better with spray adhesive. I don't know how it happened, I am not pointing any fingers, but recently I came home to find disgusting hair around the toilet seat in the hall bathroom.  When I went to clean it, it wouldn't come off. Apparently, Bobby's aggressive demand that Joey let him in the bathroom resulted in Joey spraying the adhesive on the toilet seat. Yep. A half an hour later, according to Katie the Chronicler (tattletale to most of us,) a roar erupted from the bathroom.  Bobby was stuck to the toilet seat. So, do I laugh 'til I pee or do I rid myself of any responsibility?
