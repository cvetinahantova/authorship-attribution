Scuba diving was great. What experienced divers said was true, it was like entering a new world, everything seemed new to me. Well, it was surely different from staying in an aquarium-fish store so it was really new to me. While we had'nt found a house here in Manila yet, Im staying here in my sisters house, so Im close to school, and she also has a weblog of her own, but im not telling you the address. Well, I hope there wont be any problem occuring this time on posting my blogs. Bye : )
