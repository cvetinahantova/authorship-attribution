in this quiet hour  lost in a smoke  and starlit skies  i wander the universe  in my head  or is it my heart  somewhere between  these thoughts haunt me  but now i am made  to be painfully aware   the truths that were hidden  in this awareness i can see  and my memories of blindness  have a nostalgic appeal to me  we are vessels of needs  defending psychotic turf  truth is as new to me  as your ears are to hearing it   but in the quiet hours  with judge and jury of self  we are naked without noise  and revealed...  we are liars of faith  we are liars of love  we are liars of caring  we are liars that we have  anything left to give  and we are liars that we want  nothing in return  let us all stay unconscious  because only if we are  deaf dumb and blind  will there be nothing left  to lie about  or any annoying conscience  to know that truth  is sometimes the greatest  lie of them all  Â©2003 DC Vision
