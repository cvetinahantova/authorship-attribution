No, Really.  God Told Me.   By Impeccable Jones   As  urlLink Dirtdogs  points out, Johnny Damon is looking a lot like Christ lately.    What if ol' Jesus did come back, but decided he wanted to use his powers as a leadoff centerfielder for the Boston Red Sox?  Would this confirm my suspicion that Steinbrenner is the anti-christ?  That the 2004 WS trophy is, in fact, the final Rambaldi artifact necessary to melt the polar ice caps, compromise the salinity of the Atlantic, and make inevitable the worldwide chaos that would allow for Georgie's total domination?    While we're on the topic of righteousness, I have a question about those anti-gay marriage people:  they claim this is not a question of homophobia, but the sanctity of marriage.  Okay.  But why don't they picket outside Vegas wedding chapels?  Courthouses granting divorces?  Larry King's fourteenth wedding reception?  Why don't they lobby against the marriages without children?  There seems to be some serious cognitive dissonance going on here.  Then again, even if they were ideologically consistent, I'd still think they are assholes.      Oh, and MEL?  I didn't see your face at the last supper.  Why don't you stop trying to get yourself into Heaven, grow back that mullett and make more movies the dudes like for all the shooting and ladies like for the gratuitous inclusion of your naked ass.  I haven't seen  The Passion , but I do know that Gibson has defended the film as historically accurate despite the inclusion of demons and insistently nefarious jews.   Sure, Mel.  And William Wallace, (who you conflated with Robert the Bruce anyway) fathered  urlLink Edward III .
