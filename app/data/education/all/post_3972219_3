I met George in Philadelphia in the early 90's through an ad selling airlines tickets. I had no idea that our friendship would endure time and distance. He always treated me with the greatest respect and affection and I thank him for his company and conversation. For some reason we meet people that change the course of our lives. You can never pinpoint the time or place it happens, but it happens. I feel that my friendship with George was just that kind of meeting. We became friends when I was just beginning to find my own direction in life. He advised me and gave me the confidence to be an independent woman and strong in a world far away from my family in Texas. He was like a father to me in many ways. I sought his approval in many things - including boyfriends. The day he and Dave (my husband) met, they immedietly approved of one another! George is one of the most important people in my life. When I think of George I think of sushi (lots of it), good wine, really great fattening salads, 2 hr lunches escaping to Chinatown for dim-sum, martinis, sitting in bars in Philly and wonderful conversations walking around Old City. He helped me dig my car out of the mounds of snow in NJ and worried about my welfare when I thought I had completely failed in life. I think that George knew how much I loved him. I do regret that he didn't meet Olivia (my daughter) in person. He used to say Grandpa George when I talked to him about her. My own family circumstances kept me from visiting anyone but my father in El Paso up until his death this past November. I feel that George will always be a part of the lives that he touched. I'm fortunate to be one of those people and I will honor his memory by keeping him in my heart forever. I feel like he's escaped into the life of one of the characters in his novels and will live forever in the world he created (for us).  Love,Rose Gardea de Holston(Dave and Olivia)
