SIX MONTHS TO GO!!!!! Grabe!!! It's a Monday...I'm sleepy. Heheheh. We went to the printers last Sat. Decided on the border, submitted la out of main invite. Now we have to wait for the sample invite. :)  I'm going undertime today..need to fix AVP. Left at 3pm. Brainstormed with Randy. Gosh! Ideas kept flowing from everywhere. Productive afternoon naman. Closed the day with fishballs!! yumm! I feel like I did something big today, an accomplishment.   Excited for tomorrow...meeting with Mimoy and Apple..
