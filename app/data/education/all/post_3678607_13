Oh, Woe is me...kinda. I like eBay, I really do, but I hate being out-bid! I am currently betting on a GameBoy Advance Game called "Jeopardy! Teen Tournament", and I have been out bid. Let me explain to you the reason I want this game. Long ago, I thought I could be smart enough to go on Jeopardy! and since I am a teen, the teen tournament was the obvious choice. So I signed up. And they contacted me 3 weeks ago to tell me that I have an appointment to go to L.A. and audition. Oy. I want to practice this whole jeopardy thing with the freaking game. But why? Why outbid me? It was a very obscure search of a hard-to-find game.  I WANT THE DARN GAME!!!! GRRRRR!  Obviously this angers me.   Yesterday, I decided that the previously much appraised Jamba Juice is over in my heart. I have over indulged and now it is worthless, and that makes me sad. : (
