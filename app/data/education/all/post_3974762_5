Here are some books I'd like to read, please let me know if you've read any of them...[I'm writing as if other people read my blog...ha ha]:  Henry David Thoreau, Walden -- I read excerpts of this as a junior in high school, but, of course, I remember very little and it didn't have much meaning to me at the time.  I just read an article about Thoreau and Walden in the Smithsonian and the author, who has taught for about 15 years, indicated he just recently began to 'get it' at age 44.  anything Ralph Waldo Emerson -- also a transcendentalist and good friend of Thoreau's, a minister by trade, Presbyterian, I believe.   Morton Kelsey, Agnes Sanford, John Sanford -- spirituality [from a Chrisitan perspective] and healing  Thomas Merton -- lots of books about Christian mysticism  I may add more to this later, but as it is, this list will keep me occupied for awhile.
