Nuah is the theme for today. Got a "last minute" call by joanne to join them at fisherman village. Since i am quite nuah at home, no harm joining. Went there and relaxed abit. Suddenly some suggestion on getting alchoholic drinks shot up. Jones and Me went home to get the necessary "equipments" and "Ingredients" for a night of alcoholo experimentation. Gin, Volka and Rum plus all sorts of "rubbish" for a night of "picnic" at pasir ris beach. People who dont know will think that we are going for chalets with all the drinks siah.   The breeze was blowing across our cheeks , with the music provided by a nearby pub. Fantastic ambience. No need to pay cover charge cos we just grab an empty bench and stay mixing our own concotion. It was a wonderful relaxed night. Long since i enjoyed the breeze with the waves breaking at the beach.   Now i am abit groggy though i did not drink much....hmmm......must be the effects of mixing the different type of liquor.   got to go koonz liao...adios senor Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
