Savannah can't decide if she likes Dale or not.  At first, he scared her.  Then she was shy around him, now, today, she finally touched him.  She kept saying, "who's that"  all day, so finally I told her to go touch him, he wouldn't bite.    She walks very slowly, with her head bent down peeping her eyes up from under her bangs, edging around the bookshelf, and then creeps her hand inch by inch out to touch him.  Finally, she touches his leg.  "what's that" she says, his pants I tell her.  oh.  the we do the what's that game with every peice of clothing he has on.  Now, she walks in and the first thing she says is "hey dale"    I will make a NASCAR fan out of her yet.
