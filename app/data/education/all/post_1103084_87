- so much to write - so little time -    I've been thinking about:   our new house -- spent three hours there with a house inspector last night.  vocation - endless conversations with college students constantly destabilizes my sense of rootedness in my work. (ironic, eh?)  rootedness / commitment / community - the house inspector asked last night how long we would stay in the house.  Lynn and I looked at each other.  Vague, restrained panic registering on our faces. We can't answer *that* question.  *that's* the answer we don't give.  making choices = opportunity = eliminating other opportunities.  the weather is more beautiful than ever, but...  too many people are sick and depressed to number...  Being a Good Parent / Going To Work.  Greg and I had a bang up conversation about this topic a few weeks back.    Staying in the Moment / Owning the Now / Being Ambitious / Being Intentional.  Whose purpose?  Who's driving?  Who's life?    (no I haven't read it and I won't. Don't take it personally.  I haven't smoked a cigar or been to a Christian book store in five years either (when do you get your "second virginity" with Christian bookstores anyway?).  It's kind of like Jonathon M. in college who just decided that a certain sidewalk was sacred and didn't walk on it.  Ever. Until the day he graduated.  It was an awkward sidewalk too.  Sometimes you'd be walking in a group, and all of the sudden you'd go, Where's Jonathon?  And then you'd go.  Oh. The Sidewalk.)  Class in twenty minutes. Hmmm.  Should I prep more?  Should I keep writing...
