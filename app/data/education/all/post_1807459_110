So I got the time off to go to Saipan, this is good news.  Looks like it will be Tim and I going.  There is an outside chance Jin-ah will tag along but I'm not so certain.  Anyone else is more then welcome to come if you have the time off.  I just looked at a bunch of pictures from Caleb's trip as well as assorted places online and I have to say I'm looking forward to a it a little bit.  I'm feeling pretty darn good today.  I had a great night's sleep last night and a decent workout at the gym.  We'll see how work goes today.  Tonight I think I'll take it easy and just do some laundry.  Life has gotten really good over here the last few months.  I'm giving thought to meeting up in India with Asma and touring around.  If I do I'll hang out here for about another month or so.  I think this is possible given that I think I'm in good graces with Mr. and Mrs. Kim.  I might see if I can switch schools.  I like my school my roommate and kids but the part of town could be better.   Being the movie lover that I am I just couldn't resist.

I'm just worried about having a Korean do it.
