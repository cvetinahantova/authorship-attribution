The teachers that allowed students to view this video should be held accountable for their actions.  Their actions show a lack of educational control of resources, lack of moral judgement, and lack of ethical rational.  These teachers showed a lack of educational leadership in the classroom by either not screeing the materials prior to using, or by giving students free reign of computer use.  It is also a huge ethical and moral judgement to show this particular video.  If a teacher felt it was ethical to show this video, a process of approval should have been followed.  As a teacher, I am outraged that educators would show such a disregard for their moral and ethical responsibility to students.
