Mike Molloy has a fine analysis of  fascist speechifying  as it reappears time and again in Bush’s public statements.  This is a  vital listening  exercise for all citizens of the United States.    Scroll to the bottom of  urlLink this page  and click on Molloy’s picture on the left (which has “1984” superimposed on it).   And next time you hear Bush give a public speech, see if you can identify the “five steps” of fascist speechifying that he routinely employs. Who knows? Perhaps this can provide a diversion for the whole family and give a much-needed break from the daily routine of reality TV and the Bill O'Reilly Catholic Rage Hour. At least it would be more interesting (and healthy) than taking Bush at his word.
