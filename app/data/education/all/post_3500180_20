Wooo, I just practiced my flute for 45 minutes straight, I can faint now.. =/ It seems I have a few music events coming up. School concert is tomorrow at 7p.m., after that, there would be no more concert band rehearsals, which means I don't have to get up at 6a.m. in the morning anymore ^__^, at least until when band starts again next year. Also, the parade for Strawberry Festival is on Saturday, which means I have to practice some more, and have to review the moves for Malaguena.. joy.  Anyways, today in science class, we watched the second half of the Miracle of Life video, I am scarred for life now, it was very... disturbing. >_> I was lucky enough to miss the first part of the video yesterday, since I went to help Gauss, pshhh.  Oh, and I did horribly on the EQAO, because those stupid questions don't make any sense at all..-__-
