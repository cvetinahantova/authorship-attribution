I have just realised the implication of publishing my personal musical tastes to the whole world. My reputation will be  ruined.   And now my ex is online! Whoopidoo. It's not his fault I find him immensely irritating... in fact, he's not even irritating, it's just that he's a little... slow. He's nice and all, but I don't think he was in the queue when they were handing out conversation skills, and right at the front when they were handing out free copies of "How To Be Completely and Utterly Irrelevant" by I. A. M. Pointless. For example, I'm telling him about my weekend (He asked, before you have me down as a self obsessed little girl) and what does he say?  "Was the film good?" "Ah right, cool" "So not such a good weekend then, eh? lol"  Nooo! Nothing so witty! I got:  "Spurs are wearing an all purple kit."  Why the  FUCK  do I need to know this? And how in hell is it in any way relevant to Calendar Girls? There's another puzzle for you. I say "Erm..ok.." and does he respond/apologise? Nooo! He starts telling me about some girl he met the other day. Well, at least there might be a link there... there are women in Calendar Girls?  Good Grief.  Desperate to get to the show Ceff x   # I go up, I come down, and I'm emptier inside... tell me, what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing? And why can't I let it go?#
