While digging through the e-mail that has been accumulating in my inbox these last few days, I came upon one from my TA for Software Architecture. He's working on a paper for color-encoding of software project changes, and wants me to co-author his paper. That will be nice, as I'll get an extra publication in. On the other hand, I've been working on my old project, trying again to enable individual cell coloring. Right now I can use only one color, and it just occurred to me that the cell is using the table's color as a base (which would be bad, because then I couldn't use different colors for different cells). On the other hand I was thinking of taking an entirely different approach and use drawings and/or 3D objects instead, both of which are supported by FXRuby. I've already messed around a bit with drawings, and did a simple  urlLink binary clock  (and a  urlLink funky version ) (both worked for me with the FXRuby supplied by the Windows Ruby 1.8 installer, but they should work even on Linux). Now I should probably write up some classes to make the transition go smooth - something to parse arrays into images comes to my mind. Another advantage is that I won't depend any more on the FXTable class, albeit I'll also lose some of its advantages (clickable cells, etc - I can emulate them, but it'll take quite some effort). On the other hand I  could  (and to make it easier on Jingwei,  should  be using tk instead of Fox, so I might just delay production until I got a hang of tk).
