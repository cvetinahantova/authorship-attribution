I can't concentrate. On anything. Not school, or TV, or anyone's conversations. I check my phone every 2 minutes (shit! where is it?? Hang on...... got it) to see if I've got a message, a call, anything. From Oli. I got an answering machine message from him one morning saying he needed to talk to me about something because he trusted me, and that neither his mum nor mine could know about it. I'm so scared; what if he's in trouble? What if he's got something wrong with him? At first I thought it was a hoax, but after 2 texts and 2 voice messages I began to wonder. I rang him on Wednesday morning to tell him I was here and he could call me today, but he hasn't... I'm so scared. I keep trying to tell myself it's probably something not so big: maybe he wants to change his course at uni, maybe he accidentally kissed Paul, maybe he and Victoria broke up. Maybe him and Victoria broke up because he accidentally kissed Paul... but naturally I keep coming back to the worst of the worst: he's got cancer, he's got AIDS, he's murdered someone, he's dealing drugs, he's been rap... No. NO NO NO.  Scared x   I'm holding on for you.
