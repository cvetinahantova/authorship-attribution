Ok, maybe that's a little extreme, but I'm really over all this shit that comes along with being a woman.  I've had cramps for the last 3 days straight.  I'm going to have to go to rehab for my advil addiction after this.  This is crap.  What do guys have to deal with?  Morning wood?  Seriously, women really got the short end of the stick.  I think it's all because of that god damn Eve and the stupid apple she just had to eat.  I'd really like to kick her ass right now.  Ok, I just had to let that out.  I'll have a better post tomorrow.  Adios!
