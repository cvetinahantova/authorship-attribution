Oh holy McGherkins, this new Blogger business has really thrown my wenus out of whack! Do I want a new template? Do I not want one? Can I stand to lose all your lovely comments? If I install Blogger comments should I get rid of the Haloscan ones? It's all too much! My head's gonna go pop like that guy in Scanners and make a mess all over my desk. Which is bad cos I just dusted. I need someone to take my decisions for me since I am clearly not to be trusted on my own.  Askes today was resplendent in sunshine and the kids were doing their GCSE exams, so most of the day was spent lounging around. I monoprinted my hand in the afternoon. Badly, I might add. Carla is coming tomorrow but somehow I can't seem to care. She can only jingle her bangles at me and refuse to wink, which is heartbreaking, but I'll struggle on somehow or other. Alastair has told me that I need to 'streamline' my lesson plans for the sake of my sanity. Ha! Now I can ditch the second page of the bastard things and blame my flagrant lack of differentiation planning on him. I love this school!   We have provisionally booked our wedding! It is really going to happen! This is amazing but also butt-clenchingly scary. And, with the perverse symmetry that seems to find its way into everything me and Hav do, the date has come up as  Friday 13th August . The superstitious will not be attending, it seems, although we  have  arranged for a small army of black cats to accompany us down the aisle.   I hate ending my posts. Dr. Doogie always had a witty parting shot, or a poignant moral musing. I just have full stops.   If you're lucky
