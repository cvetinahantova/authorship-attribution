Becky do you really want to eat sam gyup sal?  If so you need to let me know when and where.  If not you should stop with the cruel joke, as it pains me so.  I've found the perfect place downtown.  Really cheap and really good.  I'll probably call you later b/c I won't be able to wait for you to reply. On my way out of a restaurant tonight I saw that  there is somewhere new opening and they have "the dancing girls" going on.  What is the deal with these chicks?  Every time somewhere opens they have balloons a little stage and two girls doing synchronized dancing out front.  I guess this is why I can't understand Korea.  How exactly to you get dancing chicks?  I think there is company that hires and trains these girls (by  train I mean teaches them these silly dances to these horrible songs) and then if you're a small business owner who opens a new shop you call them and they send some girls right over.  But that is just my guess. Today I got to teach my nasty class and they were in full lewd form.  The kid who seems to know everything told me today he likes to get blowjobs.  He said that girls do it too slow so then the explained that he grabbed their head and made them do it faster.  Really where does this kid get this stuff?  Then another student explain that a chick bit off his wee-wee.  He was a little offended I think. I'm getting excited about heading to Shanghai.  I'm hoping this tour is a decent one.  For the price you can't beat it with a stick.  The tour itself cost 429,000 won and that includes airfare, hotel, all food, and sightseeing.  I looked up tickets for the flight that we will be taking that same day and the round trip ticket alone costs over 500,000 won.  I'm looking forward to a change in scenery.  They have a really tall tower in Shanghai too so I can't wait to go up in that.   Why am I still so tired?  I thought I slept well last night but I guess I am still catching up or something.
