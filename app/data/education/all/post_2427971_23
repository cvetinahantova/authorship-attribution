So much for the "stay up 'til 2 in the morning for the rest of the week", I'm so tired... Missed my bus this morning, luckily my mom was nice enough to give me a ride. I'm usually tired at A and B block then really energetic at lunch but today I was still wiped, kinda sucked... Dane was busy anyways, so tomorrow will be the day that we continue. After lunch I learned to crimp network cables for the LAN, Blanton was supposed to be doing it but after I learned all he did was snap the heads on the wire. That was my exiting open block, Tevor wasn't there 'cause Kelly stopped by for the school day... Don't know what's goin' on there, no one tells me anything. I wasn't gonna be able to see Katherine today apparently, luckily her mom decided otherwise later on. I got to surprise her, I was gonna sneak in and go through her dad's office and sit down on the chair behind her 'til she noticed. Kat's mom already had a plan, so oh well. Muahaha! Then later on I took over her computer when she was playing DAoC and "accidentally" got her killed. Then she was trying to do a quest, I pointed her in a random direction and hit NumLock(lets you run without having to push anything). Gave it a break eventually, but it was very entertaining. Thank god tomorrow is Friday, I need to sleep in this weekend and also it's a weekend. TWO MORE WEEKS 'TIL CHRISTMAS BREAK! W007, it'll be so nice to have a two week vacation to forget all the stuff I've learned so far in school. Right on for large checks of money, yay for expensive presents*cough* Katherine ;). I'm gonna get as much sleep as I can tonight, must not die of exhaustion. That's it for tonight, post some other time...
