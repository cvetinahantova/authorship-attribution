While online tonight, I found a (very) brief story about how Bruce Willis just broke up with his 26 year old girlfriend of ten months.  Now honestly, I could care less who Bruce Willis dates, but along that same line, I could care less who Demi Moore dates.  However, after having the Demi/Ashton coupling shoved down my throat for ages, I find it interesting that this is the first time that I've even heard mention that Demi's ex is also dating someone half his age.  In fact, while Demi is a modest sixteen years older than Ashton, Bruce is a whopping 23 years older than Brooke Burns, his newest ex.  While some may argue that the lack of complete and total public scrutiny is in part due to Ms. Burns' lack of fame, I find it interesting that one of the allegedly terrible things about the relationship between Demi and Ashton is that same age difference which is apparently no problem between Bruce and Brooke.  Despite the many progressions by the women's movement in the past few decades, it is still appropriate in today's culture for men to rob the cradle... just not women.  I'm so glad that we have progressed so far.  All right.  That was my rant for the day.
