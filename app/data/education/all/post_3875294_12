o.k so got to make this a quick one today.  I was invited to a lunch with some ladies that I work with at Hopkins E.  They are like my mom's age, but they are really neat ladies.  I think most, if not all of them are Christians.  Way cool.  So, then after lucnh, I got to get going fast, becasue I have dance class today.  Gosh, I quess I have two today.  Ballet, but before that it's epiphany dancers.  I guess Im the only one who can make it today, so I'll get a Jazz lesson.  Can't wait.  Hmm, this is kinda fun, I like this.  Well, gosh, better shower, and do hair, and actually put makeup on today. J
