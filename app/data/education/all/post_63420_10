This entry will be an all-Google post.....  After experiencing  urlLink Orkut  for a couple weeks it seems to be the most comprehensive social site yet in terms of content and users.  There are communities on virtually (no pun intended) every topic.  However, with the ability for anyone to start their own community, there often exist duplicate groups with little differentiation.  While the freedom afforded this capability is nice, as a user with a limited amount of time and desire to select which community(ies) to join the selection process can prove frustrating.  Which one(s) do I join ?  The process of Orkut invitations seems to work well to reduce the amount of noise and eliminate spam.  (I'm not sure how spammers are dealt with - e.g. subscription revoked, posts removed, etc. - but the content seems pure.)  Of course I bought my invitation off of EBay for a couple dollars, but that's beside the point.      urlLink GMail  is another nice product/service.   I've had my account for about 3 weeks now and not a single spam.  Even though I haven't given my address out much, I know that it's easy - though not from experience - for spammers to just append common user names to the popular domain names.  I figured that I would have received at least a couple spams by now.  But I guess that whatever Google is not on the anti-spam side seems to be working.  The content-based advertising is another interesting "feature" and I wonder how long it will be until people find a way to circumvent the service by coding messages to trigger certain ads to display.
