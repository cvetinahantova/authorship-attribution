i've come to the conclusion i'm not capable of sleeping like a normal person anymore  e.g. friday night, i was excited about saturday so i woke up a lot  e.g. last night, exhausted after having fun all day, i set my alarm for 9am this morning, went to bed, took a bit to fall asleep, then woke up with a start at 7 convinced i was late for something or other... got up, started getting ready, realized i had 2 more hours to be able to sleep before my alarm really went off, and went back to bed... 8am same thing happened... only this happens several mornings a week... i'm so weird.  but hey, at least i have lots of fun when i'm actually awake during the day, right? =)  later dudes
