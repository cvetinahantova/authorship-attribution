hello,  well it's been a busy weekend.  i went to a going away party for ermine,  french volunteer, and had a great time with all the french folk.  a bunch of  germans were there as well so english was the dominate lauguage. yeah.  it's  nice knowing what is going on.  today we took her to dreamworld, a thai  amusement park and tonight she goes back to france.  i'm a little sad  because i was just getting to know her.  the amusement park was lots of fun.  i'd forgotten how much fun it can be to  ride rides and act like a kid.  i'm also looking forward to telling my girls  about it tomorrow because i know it will get them talking.  they love to  hear about what the farangs do with their free time.  well the weekend is almost over for me.  work tomorrow.  ugh.  i've been so  busy i think i need a weekend to recover from my weekend.  well gotta run.   love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
