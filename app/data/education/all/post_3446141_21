WTH!  Why is it that the people working on the road don't feel the need to put up signs anymore??  I was on the way to work today and just about died....ok not really.  But, I was driving along, right behind someone else and then all of a sudden they switch lanes and I look in front of me and omg! there are cones lots of orange cones.  So I slam on my breaks as this man is walking towards my car and waving me into the other lane......I'm like no shit dude....thanks for the freakin sign letting me know before I come over a hill that my lane is going to end...thanks.  Not a good way to begin the day needless to say.  Things are a little better now......although I would like some caffeine; right now I am sipping on a sprite.  Ah well, everyone have a wonderful day, and what out cus you lane might end suddenly.
