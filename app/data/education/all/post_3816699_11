I found it, YES! I found it... who is the Mo' Fuckin greatest? Well there was another song that  reminded me of Jeffie, and I couldn't quite get it, or find it... But yesterdai, I was just like... *doo  doo doo**lalala* listening to From Autumn To Ashes... And all of a sudden, I heard it! I heard  the *Wooo* part in the song, that Jeffie alwais sings, and it alwais makes me smile, so I sooo  have to put this in mi blog!!!!   The song is: *Finalli*         Take Her To The Music Store-From Autumn To Ashes          Lyrics...      Emotionless grey skies bleed somber dreams of sorrow
