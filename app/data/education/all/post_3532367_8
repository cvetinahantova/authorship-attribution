What a great afternoon - not!   We took the kids on a bike ride, after loads of nagging from them. We literally got half way down the hill and my youngest daughter fell off. Fortunately, she had a helmet on but she was badly damaged on her hands, chest and face. A passer-by gave us a lift back, by putting the bikes in his van and taking the casualty home - Sandra went with her. As soon as I had arranged for someone to look after the other kids, we took her to hospital with a suspected broken finger and to get cleaned up.  Fortunately, it transpired that nothing was broken, although she was very sore. The hospital was quite quick, only 2 hours start to finish but by the time we got home it was raining, so the idea of a b-b-q had to go out of the window.... we settled for a chinese instead.
