Bright Yellow Flower   bright yellow flower has thirst for sunshine, giving me a new contentment, but rain came in my way, smothering me in sorrow...  oh flower can be strong to stand, but a pain of being splattered, with tears from the heaven, and fighting to spread my petals...  bright yellow flower represent my feelings, trying to absorb sunshine and to burst, but clouds block the beauty of seeding, and a darkness envelopes my thirst...  oh flower tries to sit still and bloom, but wind blew me away and tumbles, my dear pollens are flying everywhere, mingling with cold droplets...  bright yellow flower is too tired to go on, searching for ways to stretch my petals, but will always forever be trapped with rain, rain, and rain....   ~kekua  april 2003
