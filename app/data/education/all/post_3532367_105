My Brother in Law (Simon) offered me a ticket to the British Grand Prix this weekend. As I am not doing any work I thought it would be good to go with him, my FIL and my SIL. I told Sandra and she said it would be OK. Simon has a contact at Jordan so as he had not mentioned any money (he usually does), I asssumed it was free. It turns out later that he has paid 75 quid for the ticket. I challenged him about this as I don't want to be treated like a charity case, but he just dismissed it as being his treat.
