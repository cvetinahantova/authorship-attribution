urlLink Active Learning and Library Instruction  I am spending some time today preparing my syllabus for my LIB 197 (Library Skills) course I am teaching this fall.  It starts in a few weeks!  As always, I want a lively class with involved students.  I know that this is my responsibility as the students will be quiet and will be reluctant to get engaged.  What can I come up with?    Reminds me of my active learning article.  The first paragraph reads, "From the beginning of academic library instruction in the United States, it was noted that perhaps lecturing was not the most effective way of educating students about the library. In 1886, Davis wrote about his frustrations in teaching students about the library who were not learning anything from his lectures. This phenomenon has been noticed by many other librarians as well. The assumption that library instruction should be lectured based probably has driven the opposition of many academic librarians to library instruction. After all, if lecturing to students about library use does not work, why do it? Active learning, also known as cooperative learning, is a model of instruction that many academic librarians have turned towards to better help students learn about the library in the classroom."
