Aren't we all so excited about a 3 day weekend? It's just like the past week.. Well Chris said he might come up today but i just got off the phone with him and he's takin' a nap so i'm kinda bummed i don't get to see him today! Oh well. There's always tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that.. and so on.  So this new puppy thing isn't as exciting as it was a week ago. you guys know i'm not much of a dog person. The best dog is someone else's. Oh well. Tiff's party is tonight and i'm really excited about going. Not sure who all will be there but it'll be fun. So far this summer has been really boring except for the 45 min drive to Morris and the 45 min drive home.. Half the time with my cousin Lindsay who is about to drive me up a freakin' wall. But she's family and you gotta love 'em right? Damn the person who said that first. You've all heard my horror stories about her i'm sure. But now that we've both grown up a little (she's 12) we get along a little better. A little meaning i haven't tried to beat her up in awhile. She did run off and tell Chris that i was in love with him and that kinda pissed me off but what ever. like i said she's 12.. anyway my dog is barking so i should go let her back in.. hopefully she pottied outside like a big girl.. this is really messin' with my head.   So yeah. i hope to see all the girls tonight and i think we should have another night out and attack the poor waiters at On The Border. and not to mention get yelled at by the guys at Fun House for running into the game with all the coins in it.. you're my hero Kristine! and i'm still a little confused about Kramer.. oh well. can't wait to see y'all tonight!
