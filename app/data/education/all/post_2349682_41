It's hard to believe that my baby brother is graduated, he's no longer in high school. Geez, how come time flies by so fast? I remember when he was just a little guy who would steal my fisher price records and dance in his diapers to the music. I remember a little guy who was such a prayer warrior that in church the pastor would ask him to pray (he was 8) and he would cry for the whole church while he was praying it was so cool. Now he is a man and we couldn't be prouder. He has a heart for worship, he loves the Lord, he can sing and play the piano, and he has a heart for kids his age. I love it. Not because those are things that I am in to but because each of these aspects I mentioned makes the man of God that Gabe is. I love that he loves God and I love that he reaches out and shows his love to others. Watch out you college girls cuz here comes Gabe! Can't get him without getting through me first though, ha ha ha!
