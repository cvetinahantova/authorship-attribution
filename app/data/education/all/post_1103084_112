what if time is actually going backwards and in the beginning were paper clips and engines and robots and we start our lives old and abandoned in urine-smelling nursing homes but we get to die as babies warm and snuggled by people halfway through their own lives...?  what if the robots and the paperclips figured out a way to make us think that we're experiencing it the other way -- and really our life fource is flowing not from the grass and the trees and the air and food, but from landfills and sewers trash cans full of used floss and discarded q-tips?   and their greatest invention is organic reality: trees and squirrels and sunsets and all?    and of course ultimately an even greater invention of theirs is stories and creation myths and God.  In any case, i don't think I'd do anything differently.    (not that I could if I would)  not drunk or stoned, just tired of grading -- i bid you --   ~peace.
