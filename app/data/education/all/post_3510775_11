A word on the topic I'd like to mention When it comes to [hacking Linksys] Whoo!  I'm representin'.  Foolio neighbors set up a Linxis wireless netwerk somewheres on our strizeet, yo.  Running channel 6ix.   urlLink Inte__eer_ng w__h ou_ con_____on .  The center of the BBH was smack dab on our couch.  It was a total eclipse of the Big Dark Cloud.  So we changed our channel!   What's up now?  Punk!   I also changed their channel just for fun.  If you want to change it, the IP is  urlLink 198.162.1.1 .  The login is admin and the passphrase is admin.  Try to preent stuphs from their preenter, stuphs lyke  Stupid Link-sissy!  We loathe your channel 6!  Stop tormenting my Xtreme G!  AAAAAAGHHHHH!
