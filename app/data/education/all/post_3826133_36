Sorry its taken so long to write today ( I know you're all just dying in anticipation of what's been going on with me!)  To start with, today has been lovely.  We had the OSCE inhouse this morning and (as always) I got to run it and it was super fantastic.  Fucking Karen stayed out of it and let me do my thing.  Brilliant.  I got done early and took a long lunch.  Fantabulous.  But now my head hurts and I have to go out of town with my dad next week and I don't think I'm going to make it to Brownwood for Thanksgiving.  I just want to cry.  I don't really want to go to Dallas, but I know that it would mean the world to Dad and Lauri.  And I really want to go with Sam for Thanksgiving, but I don't know how to do it without hurting Lauri's feelings.  I'm so tired.  I want to sleep and cry and not wake up to an alarm.
