A number of words have shown in the New York Times of late that are worth mentioning ...   The Good     The word "eyas" turns out to be a young falcon. The plural is "eyases." Cool. See  urlLink "For Falcons as for People, Life in the Big City Has Its Risks as Well as Its Rewards,"  Monday, June 28.    The Bad   I don't know where this term "safehouse" is coming from. On Sunday, the Times reported that "the American military launched an airstrike hours later on what it called a Falluja safehouse for fighters in his network." Aren't we just talking about a house where our opponents are living? Is there really a house that is marked as a "safehouse" for terrorists? Or isn't it the case that almost any hosue in Falluja would be willing to harbour our opponents? In any case, I would think of a "safehouse" as basically a good thing, a place where battered women could go, for instance.    The Ugly   Finally, there is Edward Rothstein's peculiar use of the word "Judenrein" in an article about the globalization of soccer  urlLink ("Globalize Soccer? Not in Your Lifetime, Chum," Saturday, June 26) . He writes: "In Budapest, a soccer team called MTK Hungaria, founded in 1888 by Jews and long since Judenrein, is jeered by opponents with taunting banners: 'The trains are leaving for Auschwitz.'" First of all, I wonder, is it a safe bet that Americans, even educated New York Times-reading ones, know what the word "Judenrein" means? It means "free of Jews" and is seriously tainted by the Holocaust. I'm sure Rothstein is using the word with in a knowing ironic way, but I think it's odd or even ugly to use it as though it were a normal word.
