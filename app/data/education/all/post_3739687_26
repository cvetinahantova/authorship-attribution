hey friends and fam,  well i went to a concert last night with vicky and nancy (friends from st. joe)  we had a great time on khao san but the music in the park that we heard sucked.  good songs but terrrible covers. if you can't do a song justice i think you shouldn't even try to sing it.  anyway... i met someone.  so that's good news.  we had a great time and hung out all night together.  i'm looking forward to school next week believe it or not!  also i'm moving into the place i'll be living in at for today.  sunday for ya'll in the states.  if anyone needs my new address just email my mom at REDHILLSWEAVER@MCHSI.COM  she's got all the info on address and phone numbers.  love ya gotta go.  jane
