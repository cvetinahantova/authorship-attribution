Well this upcoming weekend is my mom's side of the family's Annual Family Reunion, or in other words the "Why isn't Laine married yet or at least in a serious relationship?" weekend of fun.  So I have several options...lol.....  Option number A: Come with a prepared list of all the reasons why I am apparently undateable/unmarriable.....This might actually be fun to make up it would go something like this: Not cute enough Too cute Too fat Too skinny Too smart Not smart enough Too Shy Talks too much Do you see a trend here?? lol.  Option number B: When I reach the point of frustration after being asked by over half the family (we have a big family by the way---my mom has 6 brothers and sisters, and they all have kids, and their kids have kids....and so on.) if I have a boyfriend, I will scream "NO because I am a Lesbian!"  That will shut them up.  And I will be the talk of the reunion; I always enjoy being the center of attention. ;)  Option number C: And I do believe this is my favorite.  Same situation as above, however I instead scream, "No I don't have a serious boyfriend, because I am a whore! Got that, a WHORE! One boy cannot satisfy me, I need more!  And all the guys I've screwed are too possessive and I had to dump them." ;)  So those are my three options.  Don't get me wrong, I love my family, they really are great, but shit they just don't leave the whole relationship or lack there of alone.  And it does get very annoying.  I've thought about just bringing a guy friend to "pose" as a boyfriend, lol, too bad my parents are there and they would know.  I'm hoping to get out of going to the reunion on Sunday :)!  Because it's Aliciaâ€™s Birthday and we may celebrate it on Saturday.  We will see.
