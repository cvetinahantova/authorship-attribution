see, the thing is, i couldn't even quite catch what they were talking about for a minute. the clarity came when i realized that they all thought of teachers as free babysitters for their kids that they want to be out of their hair, at least during the day, and they don't want to pay for it.  is it just because i'm a teacher that this offends me?
