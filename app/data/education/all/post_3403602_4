Hello Hello. Its noon now and Im here in my room. Doing nothin. Lol. Anyways...Hope evryone else is doing better. My Spring Break was great on Wendsday I think. You know with the movie. Yeah hopefully I can have more fun like that evryday. Im always home smacking my drums. I feel soory for them and my kat. She has to hear me drum away. Which reminds me. I need to feed her. Ugh...You know what bothers me? When my Mum and Daddio get mad at me for no reason. Its funny though. Sometimes when I dont do anything bad they find away to get me punished. Assholes and their tricky ways. Lol. Yeah Uhmm...My kat is calling me soo I need to feed her. I'll be back.   :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Long Period Of Silence::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::   Okay back. My poor kitty didnt have anything. Ugh...Uhmm...I dont know what to say. MmMmMm My sister's boyfriend (soon to be a father and husband) brought FOOD! Hehehe. Im gonna go eat now. Bye Ya'll. XoxO
