Today we had a minor scare.   I came home to the condo and found a guy with my purse in his hand outside with the front door wide open.  I got the purse back (I had to ask for it twice) and it turned out nothing else was missing.  Dan and Matt were both in the condo but were sleeping when the guy came in.    I will post the police report - it's a good summary of what happened - but I don't have it on me right now.  I will do that tomorrow so you guys can get all the details.     It was bizarre.
