So, after a 14 hour shift I'm ready to go home, tired, eyes hurting from staring at a monitor forever, and not in a very good mood. I get into my nice comfy 2002 Ford Taurus and begin to pull out of the parking lot when there's a loud bang, a grinding sound, and an acrid odour coming from the front of the car. I pull over to the side and get out, and sure enough the car body is resting on the left front tire.  Having spent my last 10 dollars on my lunch that night I had none for towing luckily for me they billed Wood Motors where I had the car towed. I had to ask one of my fellow co-workers to give me a drive home, she lives on the Royal Road, and I in Oromocto, so extremely out of her way, but being the great gal she is she drove me home.  After a few hours I called Wood Motors to get the low down on the car, and was told that the strut spring had broken and had destroyed the break line, a monitoring line, and the tie rod. The parts will cost 200 and the labor another 200, but luckily for me, apparently, there is a recall on both of the springs.  Now here is the kicker...I have not received my letter stating the recall, so I have to pay for the repairs up front, as well, they aren't going to use original Ford Parts, they are going to use after market parts, and the repairs will take up to 4 days.  So, needless to say i'm pretty pissed off over the whole thing, I have to borrow my fathers car, and the hassle of having to try and come up with the repair money for parts that have been recalled is wearing my patience very thin. I have called the head office, and will be going down to Wood Motors tommorrow to try and get some satisfaction.  At the very least they should cover the damage 100%, I should be given a rental, and some type of reimbursement for the hassle this has caused me.  Ohhhhhh....they say things come in three's...so two more to go!  :o)   RLB
