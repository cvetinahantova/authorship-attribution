Studying the waves of my thoughts, so much of which cycle endlessly, repetition that coicincided with the abuse of my body and my body and mind have suffered.  The effects on my body are profound, but so is the body's capacity for healing.  The body, as a receptical, or a transmitter of energy, has infinite resources for transformation.  Still, physical contact must be initiated first in order for deeper inner experiences to emerge.  What is this physical contact?  I believe it is a connection to a spiritual family where one is commited and loyal.  I'm not about to turn my back on the simple beauty and joy that can be obtained this way because of some ambiguous fear!  Fearfullness be gone!    Just like a preacher, ha!, but I am no preacher, nor a teacher, but I'm not opposed to learning, in fact I thirst for learning that will take me beyond myself, infuse me in the light everywhere lest I catch glimpses of myself in that cloudless manifestation.  Infuse me in the temple of my longing, may it serve to open the heart of the universe in me, measuring nothing, over and over, hurdling the void that reassures me I am as much as you are and that together we make a force that is only reconciled in freedom, joy, happiness, and love.
