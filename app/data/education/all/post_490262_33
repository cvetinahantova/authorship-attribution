OK, I'm back (she says as if she just ran out for a cup of coffee and came right back.)  Yeah, I know it's been two months but I was busy and well, you know how that goes...  I'm on summer vacation now and lovin' life.  If I could just find a job that pays me to be home yearï¿½round, then I'd be set:)  Unfortunately, when you work at home (from what I understand) they expect you to do actual work for the company and not household chores.  That's too bad.  How about some highlights from the last two months?  Here we go: ~My principal informed my "team" (me and the others who teach third grade) that we will be moving to the portables next year.  We are, of course, the grade level with the most behavior problems but, hey, I'm sure those kids will have no trouble running in and out of the building without any supervision.  ~I got a student teacher for next fall!  Yes, shortly after we got the news that we'd be moving to the portables, my teammate Natalie, who is in the middle of a high-risk pregnancy, blew a disk in her back (hmm, stress have anything to do with that?) so her student teacher got transfered to me.  She was out the rest of the school year and will be out all of September as well. ~I found a new babysitter for next year.  The baby sitter from this year is going back to school next year.  So you can see, you didn't miss much.  I'll try to update more often this summer since I should actually have time!
