Do you know what you are getting yourself into??? HUH    Â  Okay okay, so now that I'm into this phd program thing. I've told some people about it, and then they ask the question...how long will it take. So I tell them that the national average for completing a phd in the biological sciences is 5.5 years. Yah, and then everyone is like, are you sure?? HELLO, did I just apply for a phd not knowing how frikkin long it would take me?? Of COURSE I know it would take me that long. And OF COURSE I'm going to do it! It's not really about how long it is, but rather that I WANT to do it..and that's all that should count! The fact that I'm interested and am willing to complete such a degree.....
