I've realized that teaching seventh grade language arts has made me stupid.  No longer I am reading the great works of Shakespeare, Tennyson, and Coleridge.  I'm teaching adverbs to children.  No longer can I rattle off the definitions of literary terms as though I've memorized the Bedford Glossary nor can I tell someone the author or poet by simply glancing at a passage.  In college, I was much sharper than I am now.  Now, I am as dull as the blade in a cheap food processor.  I've decided to go to the library and begin checking out books.  It will prove to be beneficial for both my son and me.
