This could turn out very beneficial for those of us who fall asleep reading the book, and for those of you who actaully like the story: you get to see it on tv! It starts Sunday, August 1. Watch it.   urlLink http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/highlights/s1153108.htm     "Gorgeously filmed, wonderfully acted, beautifully costumed and staged, smartlyedited and extremely amusing – Andrew Davies’ multi-award-winning adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic Regency romance is one of the most definitive and successful TV period dramas ever.    Returning to ABC TV on Sunday, August 1st at 8.30pm over six exhilarating episodes, Pride and Prejudice pulsates with energy as lively, witty Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle) charms smouldering, haughty Mr Darcy (Colin Frith) against a backdrop of picture-postcard countryside, small-town assembly rooms and English stately homes.  Every single performance sparkles, the sets and locations are beautiful, the music keeps perfect pace with the action, and the sexual tension between the leads keeps viewers glued to their TV sets.  Pride and Prejudice is a television masterpiece that has to be simply enjoyed, if not surrendered to. You won’t want to miss a moment. Lavish and piquant as a TV series should be, Pride and Prejudice never misses a note of Austen’s arch comic tone.  Colin Firth plays Mr Darcy superbly – all haughty and unapproachable but only just hiding his vulnerability. Jennifer Ehle is a fascinating Elizabeth as the sexual tension between her and Darcy turns white hot!  ABC TV has long been the home of period drama and with Pride and Prejudice it has the best of them all."
