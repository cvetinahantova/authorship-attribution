Saturday night, the usual hectic stuff going on.  baths for the boys, washing clothes for church tomorrow, the usual.    Tommy sat down tonight to go over the bills, now he is sitting in the living room having chest pains.  I think he has stress attacks.  Not quite panic attacks, but along those lines.  HE used to ahve them a few years ago, then we started doing really good, and they stopped.  Now, he is worried over everything, and they are back.  Wishing Duke would win tonight.  I havent' been watching the game, mainly because they are sitting in there with the sound muted.  I can't stand to watach a ballgame with no announcers.  Drives me nuts.   My washer is smoking and smelling funny.  I think it has finally given up .    I really dread telling Tommy, just another thing for him to worry about.  Sheesh, when it rains, it pours.  I mean really, really pours.
