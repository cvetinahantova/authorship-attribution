We took some of the students river rafting on Friday. We have a heavy outdoor/recreation component to our system. It helps a lot of the kids to buy-in to the program, something to look forward to, and work on their therapeutic and academic goals. The water was freezing cold, but we all had wetsuites. Of course the kids wore helmets. I really look forward to these type of outings, as they are also an incentive for me to stay at my job.    On the rafting trip one of the students decided to act as if she had passed out in the water. This raised a lot of concern at the time, and could have endangered those who would have jumped in to "save" her. We yelled to her, and she was non-responsive. Fortunately, we had a staff member down river with a throw bag; he pulled her out of the water. When asked what the problem was, she said she didn't hear us calling to her, but it was clear that she was trying to create drama around her. This is her method of operation. The consequence for her action is basically the worst that can be given, besides suspension. She lost her level at the school. It could take a couple of weeks, or longer, to get back to her level.   We have a progressive level system at the school, which is the cornerstone of our behavior modification paradigm. Each successive level brings more priviledges, and the ability to go on the "high-end" incentive outings. We also have whole-school experiential outings, but again the students must maintain a certain level of safety in order to attend. Those who do not go have academics to occupy them.  I'm going to have one of my workmates write on this Blog. She is a teacher in a different class. I hope she will, because I think she needs the "release" more than I.
