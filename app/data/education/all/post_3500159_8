These last few weeks have been crazy.  I suppose that time really does go faster when you get older, but it is hard to get anything accomplished when time is zooming by!   School starts back for me next week and the boys the week after that.  My niece, Susan moved in with us two weeks ago after accepting a job in Human Resources at the Albertson's Division Office here.  It has been lovely having her and not as much of an adjustment (at least for us) as I thought it would be.  It is nice to not be the only woman in the house!  She will be getting her apartment next month but for now I am trying to spoil her a bit.    My graduate courses will resume the end of August and while I dread the drive to Denton, I really want this degree badly.   I have been working out regularly lately.  Dixie, Susan and I are attending Jazzercize four to five times a week and working out in the gym on other nights.  I have never worked out so much and I hope it helps.   Our family is still reeling in the loss of my cousin and I still haven't been able to be much comfort to his parents.  Of that, I am ashamed.  I wish so much that I could reach out to them, but I am so aware that both my sons are alive and healthy and how is that fair?     On a lighter note, I have been able to spend some much needed time with a dear friend whom I had not seen in a year and that was lovely.  My closets are cleaned out, my laundry is done and so I guess I can go back to work.......
