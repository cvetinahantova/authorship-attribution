i'm so depressed. partly coz i've got nothing to post.   stupid friendster! my testimonials--all approved, but none appear on the page! wtf is happenin'? i hope my frenz don't have to re-type another testimonial for me!   can't chat in peace or use friendster or blogger when my parents are home or when i dont know the time they will come home. that really sucks. they never seem to pick on my younger bro that much when he uses the com. and plus i hardly get the dumb com at home. i wish i could live away from my family now. that would be the best day of my life. though i need to learn to spend properly.   tomorrow i have school!! shucks. still have homework.  i'm sure my parents wont let me got to the botanic garden with my friend and stuff. they're so horrid to me nowadays. thats the good thing about boarding school. but my hall sucks too. the best hall would be hall 4. hall 3 has that terrible yvonne lim and grace kwee. i only like mr tan. and now i need to attend hcl remedial with wang fang hong. and my roommates wanna be with the china peeps. whatever.  gotta go research now. see ya soon!
