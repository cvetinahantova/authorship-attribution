WOW! How do you respond to something that big?  I personally wouldn't want anyone to use my computer for a "shared power" project.  I understand the importance of having shared power between computers.  It allows people to perform astronomical amounts of computation with the power of many computers together.  The idea of helping sort radio signals from outer space with my computer is insane.  I would not want anyone to put software on my computer, use it freely without me having any knowledge about what was going on.  I don't think that anytime in the near future we will have "roaming computational tribes".  The idea of a group of people sharing computer power to perform major computations is far-fetched for an individual like me.  I don't believe that teachers will be sitting around the lounge sharing laptop power to compute radio signals from outer space.  BC
