So, a friend of mine has a blog.  I didn't even know what the heck a blog was until he said "hey, go to my blog."  So I figured, "what the heck, let's go to his blog."  I then realized it is simply a place to put down thoughts.  I used to do this ALL the time way back in college.  I'm old now.  I make excuses why I don't have the time to write.  They're all lame, pathetic excuses.  He's a very busy man, so why can't a loser like me find time to write as well?    So here I am.  Yea me.  I have a blog.  "woo woo woo woo" (chanting and twisiting my arm Arsenio Hall style).  Okay.  That's enough for now.  We'll see how long this lasts.  I give it a week.
