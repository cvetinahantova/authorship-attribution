hello,  well i've been here long enough to miss a few things about mississippi.  here is a list of things i hope everyone down south is enjoying:  1.  taking long country drives with friends, while listening to the grateful dead. 2.  fresh tomatoes from the garden (even though the deer ate my entire garden last year) 3.  having a tomato garden. 4.  fresh air.  bangkok is extremely polluted. 5.  playing ball with faye in the front of oxford apartments while cooking veggies on the grill and drinking a budweiser.  bud is as expensive in grocery stores over here as it is in the bars of mississippi. 6.  my family and friends.  i know it's cheesy but i do miss you.  hope everyone is having a good time.  i love ya.  jane  ps i got my first paycheck today! go me.
