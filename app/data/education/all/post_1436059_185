Brian and Corynne played volleyball with me while the "adults" talked...Sean and Ryan didn't really do much but stay quiet and listen to their parents talk with all the other old people. Their loss! Then Mandy came over with her baby twin siblings, Tyler and Kelsey, who played with Corynne's younger brothers and sister. So, the teenagers (except Sean and Ryan, as mentioned earlier) played volleyball and had a jolly good time.  Now I'm going to go see Spiderman2 again with Corynne, because she really liked it and I was the only one who didn't mind seeing it again.  I've been using the new guitar program my dad got from Jett Robb to write down the music. It's realllllyyy cooool.
