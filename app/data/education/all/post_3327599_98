good job.. now.. say it faster.. good job my little minions..  so this will be my last post for a couple of days... i know every one is sad...  we went bowling tonight. for once i was on time. it was the rest of the group that was late. unfortunately some ppl didn't bother to show up at all.. oh well that's your loss because we had a blast! i came in 4th to last the first 2 games and then i think 3rd in the last one. (i actually beat Phil! hehe) Angel and Kevin were there with Randall and Melinda. Sheila and my brothers were there too. my favorite part would be when John locked my keys in the car.. or the perverted jokes about greasy balls.. or when Phil humped Angel's ball.. or David hahahaha.. the list goes on. after that we went to taco bell in jenks where surprisingly enough they messed up the order yay jenks. after that i went home and went to bed like a good little girl! and while i was sleeping i had the most interesting dream...  in my dream i snuck out and went to Phil's apartment where we hung out watching cartoons for awhile. we soon got bored with the animated goodness and focused on some real life issues.. like.. umm.. not so animated goodness.. lol. i suppose i'll let you fill in the rest i wouldn't want my dream to embarrass the other person involved.. just know that it was well worth the trouble i could have been in.. had this been real life.. haha.. i wonder what he dreamed about..
