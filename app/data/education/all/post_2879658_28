Gyoza Party!        Okay...so the food in Japan comes in both very good and incredibly disgusting forms.  Luckily I have found enough things that I really enjoy to maintain a little variety in my daily meals.  Yesterday, Yuko picked me up from Teizan and she and I headed to the Tagajo Co-Op to load up on the necessary ingredients that would shortly thereafter become my first attempt at cooking something that doesn`t come in a ready-made package or from the local convenient store.  Then we headed to Nitanai-senseis apartment and began to cook!    Actually, I first watched Yuko chop all sorts of things including cabbage, garlic, ginger, some strange Chinese vegetable, another strange Japanese vegetable...you get the idea.   Then came the fun part.  For those of you who don`t know, gyoza are basically the equivalent of a Chinese dumpling.  With these little circles of dough or something along those lines, I learned the art of folding gyoza.  Unfortunately, mine didn`t come out quite as nicely as theirs but I think that is due to years of practice folding the origami papers.  After making 41, it then was time to throw them in the frying pan and watch them cook.    Apparently a slight mistake was made in the final step and they were laughing because things didn`t come out the way they should have.  I didn`t notice anything wrong and was actually quite impressed that we had made 2 different types.  We then enjoyed our gyoza while watching this crazy Japanese competition on TV and after 5 hours I was finally returned home.  All in all another great evening in Japan!
