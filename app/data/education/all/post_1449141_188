What should lovers of peace and justice do with memorial day.  A day that many dwell on the "heroes of war."    Kathleen McTigue has some words that are fitting.  "hHeroes of War" are transformed into our own personal sages who walk with us still.   ******* They are with Us Still.  In the struggles we choose for ourselves, in the ways we move forward in our lives and bring our wold forward with us.    It is right  to remember the names of those who gave us strength in this choice of living.  It is right to name the power of hard lives well-lived.  We share a history with those lives.  We belong to the same motion.  They too were strengthened by what had gone before.  They too were drawn on by the vision of what might come to be.  Those who lived before us, who struggled for justice and sufferend in justistice before us, have not melted into the dust, and have not disappeared.    They are with us still.   The lives they lived hold us steady.  Their words remind us and call us back to ourselves.  Their courage and love evoke our own.  We, the living, carry them with us:  we are their voices, their hands and their hearts.  We take them with us, and with them choose the deeper path of living.  (Let us name those who lend strength in our lives.)  ****
