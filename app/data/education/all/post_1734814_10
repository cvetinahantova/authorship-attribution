mmmm....sweet nourishing coffee. Ok, so it's not sweet, cause i don't take sugar. Anyhow, now that there is a little less blood in my caffeine system i can think a little better.  What am i going to do wit this blog. I hate the concept of using it as an online diary, but this is kinda what a blog is. Mostly it will probably contain random musings at early hours of the morning when i should be marking or writing lesson plans. Any abuse i feel like giving to the various incompetents that inhabit this planet (and occasionally i probably fit this description too) and whatever else i feel like posting.  Basically this will be a repository for all those thouhgts and ramblings that i consider too inane to post on my regular forums (except for one which was way too quiet recently so i filled in the space with nonsence).  OK, nothing else to type now, think i might go visit the online church. Check it out at  urlLink www.churchoffools.com
