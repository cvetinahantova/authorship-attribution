Computer Apps....................once again............boring.........but anyways, I actually watched MTV last night and the new Outkast song is great! I feel sick every time I hear Yellowcard because they can't write their own music.....but oh well, it's alright too. I'm getting scared for some of the people who have xanga's under the name SCREAMFORME52!!!!!!!!!!! and they need to chill for a lil bit before they get in over their head. Nothing to say today, so, love you all and keep me in your prayers and maybe I will come around soon.    I know you'd like to think that your sh-t don't stank................
