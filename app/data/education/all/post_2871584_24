Tim officially cursed me yesterday.  He came over and hung out for a while, and in the course of our discussion, we were talking about fire alarms.  (Tim is starting to discover the thrill that exists in living on campus.)  All right.  Great.  The evening continued.  It was a 1:30-in-the-morning-Denny's kind of night.  Got back and wrote some e-mails.  Did a little reading.  Got to bed between 4:30 and 5:00 ... to be woken up at 10:30 or so this morning by the *loudest* fire alarm that I have *ever* heard.  Oh man.  So I pull on a pair of jeans over my pajamas, and go outside... for twenty minutes.  The fire department comes, and searches the building.  They finally figure out why it went off.  Housekeeping was vacuuming the hallway, and the dust set it off.  What the hell?!    In other news, I'm going to Syracuse tonight with the Admissions Department and a bunch of students to see "Chicago."  That promises to be a good evening.  Wee!
