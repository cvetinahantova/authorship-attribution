never try and actually teach when it is a non-uniform day!!! Left feeling like I was such a bad teacher.  all the kids were hyper.  On a more pleasing school note my Y7s were shocked and amazed that a teacher knew who Eminem was and owned a Blueprint skateboard.  They then proceeded to quiz me with about tricks and bands (can I do a kick flip? - No. Have I heard of System of a Down? - Yes but never heard their music).  I've got to be careful though.  I so don't want to become the try hard to be trendy teacher that is totally ineffectual and laughed at.    One thing yesterday really scared me,  a british-asian kid in my class who I get on with very well came in all excited and jumpy.  He had seen Bin Laden on the television the night before and had heard about the bomb in Turkey and it had seemed to make his day.  He spent the whole lesson telling me about it.  Found the experience very alarming, was it just teenage boy bravado or was he really talking about his heroes?  Didn't know what to say or how to react but it made me understand the talk about fighting for hearts and minds a lot more- and how far off that is.  God have mercy on us.
