urlLink National Forum on Information Literacy  This site has lots of information relating to information literacy.  It lists upcoming programs and meetings, offers publications, provides information literacy definitions, and includes a member list.  It appears to be a good site for those interested in information literacy.  Here is a blurb from the index page:  "The National Forum on Information Literacy was created in 1990 as a response to the recommendations of the American Library Association's Presidential Committee on Information Literacy. These education, library, and business leaders stated that no other change in American society has offered greater challenges than the emergence of the Information Age. Information is expanding at an unprecedented rate, and enormously rapid strides are being made in technology for storing, organizing, and accessing the ever-growing tidal wave of information. The combined effect of these factors is an increasingly fragmented information base, a large component of which are available only to people with money and/or acceptable institutional affiliations. In the recent past, the outcome of these challenges has been characterized as the digital divide."
