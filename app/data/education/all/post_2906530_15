The subject of today's rant is about a certain animal like acquaintance I am forced to be in contact on a daily basis I have named him in my list of people I hate that's right folks its that dog you love to hate, Paul Leonard. Me and him were having one of our daily discussions which go along the lines of:  ME: Paul you wanker, piss off Paul: (in a harsh and threatening untertone) err no Dave you fat piece of shit now let me explain to you the facts Paul is a scrawny some what weak person. Some may say, "wait he might really be strong for all you know" well your wrong as in the past he has been beaten up by a year nine much smaller than himself and was tripped up once in football and broke his leg. Not only that he has punched me before and I would say that it was nothing to go crying about. Now this all brings me to today's escapade Me: (holding a water bottle chuckling menacingly, pretending to tip it in to his bag which to add insult to injury had infect happened to him the day before) Paul: Dave! Stop it or ill kick the shit out of you  Me: yea right ill believe it when I see it. Now let me just emphasize the point pails fighting and brute strength track record is very poor and not to mention I am very strong (I'm not trying to tute my own horn but I am) and I am well trained in Ju Jitsu so any pathetic attempt to "beat the shit out of me" would have been met with a painful blocking technique and then an even more painful arm, wrist or shoulder technique, not to mention all of his current threats have never come to light so I really just ignore his unvaried and non fear inspiring threats and insults. well that's a few thoughts off my chest for now.
