Here's what I hate about conference week.  I started teaching when I was 22.  I've been a teacher for almost 12 years now.  I know how to be a teacher and what to do with kids who aren't doing what they should in the classroom.  I've been a mom for almost 3 years.  I have never had a third grader of my own at home.  I have a pretty good idea about how we'll handle homework and chores and all that but you never know.  After all my kids weren't going to watch TV, either (ha ha, that lasted all of 8 months).  So I hate having to tell parents--parents who have been doing this parenting thing for at least 6 years longer than I have--how to be a parent.  Should I really have to tell these people to NOT let their children watch TV if homework isn't getting done?  Or to yank them out of sports if they are failing EVERY subject?  Only three more conferences to go...
