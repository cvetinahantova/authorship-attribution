Good Evening all.   Today's most fulfilling day included 3 almost bearable lessons, 2 highly enjoyable frees, a trip to the passport photo booth, the acquisition of a bass tuner and a shopping trip to New Look accompanied by Coz+Kat followed by a nasty bout of loneliness. They're all so... coupley. Happy. Content with each other. And then there's me. Royal fucker-up of relationships.   They tried to make me go past Phones4U (where Gaz works), but resisted... I'm not into all that enthusiasm, I'm trying not to get all obsessed with him cos it won't help, and I'm not gonna let a guy run my life without even realising it. So I'm just gonna take it easy... see how it goes. And anyways I'm going to WS1 tomorrow night so you never know who'll be out and about there! Rar... men ;o)  See you at the show Ceff x   # I've got it all, but I feel so deprived... #
