urlLink Information literacy - Wikipedia  Here is a new article at Wikipedia on information literacy.  I think it is a good introduction to the topic.  If you don't like it and want to make changes, go ahead.  Wikipedia is open source and anyone can make additions and changes to the encyclopedia.  (It sounds like this is a vandals paradise but the hundreds of heavy users of the site run a tight ship and have methods of banning and reverting the mischief of pranksters.)  From the article:  "Although alternate definitions for information literacy have been developed by educational institutions, professional organizations and individuals, they are likely to stem from the definition offered in the Final Report of the American Library Association (ALA) Presidential Committee on Information Literacy, "To be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate and use effectively the needed information"(1989, p. 1). Since information may be presented in a number of formats, the term information applies to more than just the printed word. Other literacies such as visual, media, computer, network, and basic literacies are implicit in information literacy."  Full article at  urlLink http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy .
