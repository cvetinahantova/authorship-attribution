In a rising trend I checked the death clock too and didn't do too bad for myself.  I should die on October 20 2077.  Man what am I worried about I got tons of time too go.  Granted I'll be 98 almost 99 when I die but hopefully I'll have some decent health to accompany the longevity.  If not that could suck.  I came across that sight along time ago.  I think it was the summer of 99 when I was co-oping for GA Power.  But I think I wimped out and didn't want to find out when I would kick it.  But times have changed and I don't care.  I really hate my washing machine.  What a piece of crap.  You know how most Korean washing machines have some kind of spin dry cycle at the end?  Well mine doesn't have that.  Instead it has a separate little part next to the washing machine that will do that for you.  The only catch is this.  It is a fraction of the size of the washing machine.  So for one load you'd have to run this thing like 5 or 6 times.  Next the latch on top is broken so you have to hold it down.  Then, the thing spins so fast that the washing machine moves b/c not all the legs are even.  What a pain in the ass.  Everything about my bathroom blows asshole.  Why do we have to have stupid teacher meetings every month now?  That is another pain in the ass.  We have to get up go downtown and listen to God know's who speak.  LIKE is on the decline and they keep thinking that if they put on more and more bandaids stuff will get fixed.  I don't care if they bankrupt, just as long as it is after I've left.  I have no ill will towards them but it is only business.  I do like the kids I teach but I have no love for Mr. or Mrs. Kim.  I guess I should mention I think it is the same way on the other side as well.  I just hate having to get up and go downtown for something that I consider to be extremely uninformative.
