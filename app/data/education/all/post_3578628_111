*NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS ONE PARTICULAR PERSON  The only year everyone should care what's happening is when a presidential election is coming.  I've lately become a political nut.  I could offer my thoughts on any subject or ask for your thought whenever.  But I won't because it's the summer.  And I agree with Paige who told me...It's worth it to know but it's the summer and I don't care.  That doesn't work with me because I like knowing what's going on.  And you think watching the news works.  Nope, sorry.  CNN..FOX...MSNBC...no one watches that on their own.  Look at the newspaper?  Ya, the classifieds and the movie/tv section.  Comic strips too.  The one place you can get news is your homepage.  It'll appear when you sign on.  Lance Armstrong won (sixth time in a row).  That's great.  The French are spitting on him.  Did you know that? Probably not.  There are some conventions where the candidates will spend time and then be nominated.  9/11 commission says our intelligence sucks.  Important stuff any person who wants to be a decent citizen should know. Here's what I've figured out:  I'm sorry if you have the privilege to vote this year.  Because you get to choose between the bad and the badder.  Bad english but it's the truth.  Now, you'd be surprise to know that you can laugh at this stuff and get news at the same time in a cool way.  Jon Stewart and Michael Moore are excellent.  The reason people think they aren't giving the truth is because it's either shocking or funny.  Well, a lot of things happening are funny cause they shouldn't be happening.  Rock the Vote is cool.  SNL skits are awesome.  Young people need to pay attention.  If you don't get interested, this fall check out the news once a week.  Just a suggestion.
