Today I heard a voice I hadn't heard in 9 years.  From across the ocean he called me.  It would have been nice to hear from an old friend, but the connection was bad, and I was not at my best.  I get floored easily by bad connections.  Hopefully he will call again before another nine years go by.    It was... 1991, back of the movie theater, when I had my first kiss.  It was sweet, and then his friend started teasing him and they almost got in a fight.  The next boy to kiss me was 1992, after a 4-H dance at State Conference.  Then there was the third one, in the highschool auditorium.  After that most of it's vague.  Once the innocence of youth is lost each kiss in your life seems a little less special, less memorable.  It's been a year and a half scince the last time I was kissed.
