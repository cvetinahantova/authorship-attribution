Sup Y'all?!   OMG Guys!!!  You have written WAY too much for me to read here at 12:45 a.m.  while sitting here on Anchor Dr....My GOSH its good to be home.   YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I HAVE MISSED YOU ALL ! I don't think there was a single day I wasn't thinking of at least one of you like "MY GOD I WISH I HAD SOMEONE TO TALK TO THAT DIDN'T ASK 'HOW Y'ALL DOIN' THIS FINE NIGHT?'"  I must admit...Paige...I thought of you the most because of the book.  Maybe I'm just weird...but I kept wondering what you were thinking while reading it...like i said...beats me.   Anyway...I'm only here for a VERY short while again...like until Wendesday.  I'm then leaving again until Monday at which point I SHOULD be here for the rest of the summer.   WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING .  This in itself leads me into something completely and totally different that nobody wants to read cuz it will take toooooo long.  Anyway... SOMEBODY  please contact me and we'll try to get together.  I got a call on my cell phone while in TN from the Main Office requesting a time that I would be back because they need my "final say" on the network...I wanted to tell them to shove it up their as*es and hire somebody who knew what they were doing...but I said I would stop by for like 5 minutes tomorrow...other than that I'm free to "hang".  GOD its good to be home.  I've got sooo much more to write, but for the love of you people...I'll stop.  I'll maybe explain more later, but I  HAVE  to get this out:  I think I have seriously changed.  I don't for some reason feel like I don't 'KNOW MYSELF' anymore.  I think a lot of you will be pleasantly surprised at my new found confidence and "spunk."  Once again...can't go into detail here.     OOOOOO---BTW:  WELCOME DAVID!!!   CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU GUYS!!!!-Josh
