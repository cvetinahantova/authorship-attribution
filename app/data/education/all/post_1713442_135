urlLink Library Literacy Programs for English Language Learners  Just a reminder that reading literacy is an important part of information literacy.  As an academic librarian, I often forget this.  From the site:  "As early as 1629, Puritans bound for Salem, Massachusetts, included a collection of books in their cargo; in 1655, colonist Robert Keayne willed money for the founding of a public library in Boston (Shera, 1965). While many early libraries resided in universities, later industrialist philanthropists, such as Enoch Pratt and Andrew Carnegie, endowed public libraries and stipulated that local governments also provide financial support for local community libraries. Pratt's credo, "My library shall be for all, rich and poor without distinction of race or color," resonates among libraries today (Schuchat, 1985, p. 7). In the 1960s, the federal War on Poverty Program increased funding to help support literacy programs (Comings & Cuban, 2000). Individual states and communities have continued to fund projects to reach increasingly diverse local populations. From 1988 to 1995, for example, the California State Library funded the Partnerships for Change Program, which involved 26 community libraries that analyzed and restructured programs and policies to better serve their culturally diverse communities (California State Library & Library of California, 2001)."
