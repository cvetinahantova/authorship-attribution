I saw  urlLink The Phantom of the Opera  today for the first time.  I must say, I didn't really like it.  I didn't care about any of the characters and I didn't really feel like they should be motivated to do whatever it is they were doing.  I've heard about this show for years and finally I got to see it and it was dumb.  I guess that's what you get from Andrew Lloyd Webber.   urlLink Cats , another Webber show, was even worse than this one.  In fact, Cats was just a waste of time and money at the theater.  I'll take  urlLink Les Miserables  over any musical any day of the week.  In response to Max's comment, I would even take Les Miz over  urlLink Avenue Q , though Ave. Q was very good and runs a respectable second.  Also a must see.
