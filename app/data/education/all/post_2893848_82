Day one.  This blog will  urlLink rock like babies cry  as soon as I can overcome this unbearable pressure to be interesting.   Lately, action movies are making me tear up a little bit, especially when unnamed henchmen eat it.  I can't explain this, really, and this is not the sort of sensitivity that seems useful.  I wondered for a minute if perhaps this was a christ-like love for all humanity (including henchmen, I guess) but I hate way too many people for that.   urlLink Way .   urlLink Too .  urlLink Many .  In fact, I even hate some  urlLink henchmen .   So much for that theory.  I wonder if it is empathy so much as the impossible desire for heroic glory.  Like the glory of Kurt Russell in  Big Trouble in Little China , or the dude himself in  Kindergarten Cop .  Or, if you want to get all educational, Stagger Lee.  These characters are, almost definitionally, neither absolutely moral or perfect, but  when they shoot somebody, you're glad they did.  You're glad because there is, despite its presence in their personality, no moral gray area to their actions.  To put it another way, I think I would rather be dropped by an orcish arrow at Helm's Deep than try to decide whether or not I should really feel bad for littering.  So maybe I cry at action movies the way some ladies cry at romantic comedies: a longing for a certain kind of life that is a certain impossibility.
