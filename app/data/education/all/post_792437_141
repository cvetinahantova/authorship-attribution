Back at it..but HERE   I took a year hiatus from this msg board and started a new one..only to come back to this one. I figure that with time I will delete the other one. I need to figure out a way, however to get all the posts from that msg board onto here. Those posts were from the year of 2003-2004, well the academic school year.  I'm starting back here again for the academic year of 2004-2005 and onwards. I like this msg board just a heck of a lot better.
