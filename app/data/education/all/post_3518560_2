It's Thursday morning, wish it was Friday.  Actually no, I wish it was Saturday, because then I would be at home in bed.  Chester has already e-mailed me 4 times this morning and it's only 8:50!  He needs to fuckin call his wife, Jesus.  Cop said I need to take him up on his Vegas offer then tell him I'm on the rag when we're there, I was like yeah... so he can just ask for head?  He's like "just tell him you have oral herpes!"  haha!  Now that's funny!  Cop's wife is coming today to stay for the weekend... if only you could see the excitement on my face. :|  Riiiiiiiiiiiiight.  So, totally off the subject of what I normally talk about, I just ran across this guy's blog and it's fuckin awesome.  He has some great stories , check it out:  urlLink TJ's Place .  Now this guy is pure comedy, you gotta check this out:  urlLink beer and rap .  Well, today was really fuckin lame.  I should be getting some Netflix movies in today, so, um... yeah, that's exciting. Hasta luego.
