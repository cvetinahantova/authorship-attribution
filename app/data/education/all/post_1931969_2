Hi.  A good friend of mine sent me this interesting image.    One can only assume that the Hungarian(s) bureaucrat(s) who was/were working at their local department of transportation was/were not fluent in English.   However, one cannot but simply ask the question: "What were they thinking when they issued this car plate?"  Cheers,  Ioannis, 20040621154000  P.S. No, I am not going to write/discuss about yesterday's game between Greece and Russia for Euro2004.  As one sports site put it very eloquently, it was a russian roulette game, but the bullet exploded in Spain's head :) icd
