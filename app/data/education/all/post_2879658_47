Three days a week I am forced to walk about 30 minutes to and from school.  During the winter months I occupied that time listening to Jack Johnson.  Recently I have filled that time with either talking to friends or making a mental note of everything I need to accomplish.  On Tuesday my walk was definitely one of the best.   About 1/2 way through my walk home, I looked to the right and saw these two cute little japanese girls playing with a rabbit.  The girls saw me and smiled and I heard a little konnichiwa from the smaller of the two.  I smile back, said both konnichiwa and hello and then continued on my walk.  After about 10 feet, I heard some steps behind me and a very quiet hello.  I turned around to see the smaller of the two standing right behind me.  I took off my sunglasses and kneeled down in order to be more at her level since approaching a foreigner can be quite a daunting task.  She asked me my name and then I asked hers.  Then I asked her how old she was.  She responded she was 5 and immediately asked me my age.  During this brief conversation the older of the two made her way to me carrying the small rabbit.  I then had the name and age conversation with her as well as learned that their bunny is one years old and named Lucky.  I definitely laughed a little and told them how impressed I was that their rabbit has an english name.     After this brief little conversation, obviously entirely in my basic Japanese as they were too young to know much beyond hello and bye bye, I said sayonara and continued my walk home realizing that moments like the one I just experienced are the type of moments I will probably miss when I leave Japan.  When they are not staring or pointing at you, Japanese kids are definitely some of the cutest in the world.
