Midnight slumber flows thick through slient room; Well-dressed, well-kept, and well-nigh destitute Of hope that spurns the weary soul to sing. Eyes, long-dry, crammed tightly against a brain That throbs and throbs as insanity beats His painful rhythym, open to behold Nothing, save the fear of reality. Fear, and an empty room where once lay love, Of touch and another and of the world That was at once brilliant with memory And still so dissonant with cruelty.
