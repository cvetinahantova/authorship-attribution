S and I were planning on having ourselves a really nice anniversary this year (our 6th).  We were planning on leaving Shorty with his parents and having the weekend all to ourselves.  Something we have only done once before with tragedy occurring on our way to my parents house...a whole other post.     We were planning on staying at a really nice hotel in the middle of Austin and playing stupid teenagers along 6th street, hanging out at really expensive restaurants, and other stuff like that.  S was planning on booking the hotel but decided he would contact his parents again to confirm that they'd be willing to watch Shorty.     Well, wouldn't you know it that my mother-in-law (mil) called the other night and informed me that she and my fil (father-in-law) were planning on a time when we could get together for dinner.  I casually brought up the weekend we were planning on our vacation and she told me that they were going out of town and wouldn't be back until Sunday night.     WTF?!?!  But...But...But. *sigh*  So much for our romantic vacation.  I didn't remind mil about their prior agreement to watch Shorty for the weekend.  Especially since they are going out of town on church business (he's a  urlLink minister ) , but dammit!   I'm really disappointed.
