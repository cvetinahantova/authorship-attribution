Last night I was scared half to death!  I had just turned out my lights in my room, and I had my back to the door, almost asleep.  All of a sudden, I heard the door open a crack.  It wasn't one of those the-wind-blew-the-door sounds, it was one of those sounds where you  know  something's on the other side.  Well, I heard it again.  I froze, and started thinking, "What if someone broke into the house?  Why isn't Sally barking?  What should I do?  Well, I could pretend to be asleep.  What if they want to kill me?  Feigning sleep...not an honorable way to die.  My knife is on the other side of the room, so is my bo staff.  My bat is under my bed.  Great, I don't have anything on my stand.  Stupid!  Well, I could always use tae kwon do!  I am a red belt, I can disarm knives and guns.  I can do this."  So, I turned around really fast and assumed a fighting stance while sitting up (really weird).  And, there was Mom!  "Mom, you scared the crap out of me!"  And, then she said, "I'm sorry, I just wanted to see if you had any windows open without waking you.  It's thundering."  So, about fifteen minutes later, my heart stopped beating violently (just kidding) and I went to sleep.  We had a huge thunderstorm with lots of rain and thunder and lightning (duhh).  And hail, too.  And that was at 1715.  Now, it's 1945 and there's still hail in the yard.  Mom's flowers have been mutilitated by it.  Mr. Gemberling (Kevin) taught tae kwon do tonight.  He really worked us out.  That equals my two-mile runs for the next two days, at least.
