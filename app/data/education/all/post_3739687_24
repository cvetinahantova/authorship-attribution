hello everyone,  well school is going great.  i didn't have to substitute teach today so it was nice being on my actual schedule.  the only problem i had was with the 1/2 class which is the first graders.  they have so much energy and i wasn't sure how to handle them.  also, i'm still in the habit of talking to fast.  i have to make myself remember to slow down.  other than that the day went by very smoothly.  tomorrow i'm playing basketball again with the teachers and girls.  i had so much fun last week.  the kids love playing with the teachers too.  hopefully i won't twist an ankle or worse hurt one of them.  their only complaint last week was that we were throwing the ball a little to hard.  anyway... i'm ready to hit the court again.  went shopping today.  i hate shopping but this was o.k. because i'm soooooo tired of wearing the same clothes all the time.  i got a couple of things for work and one shirt for going out.  i guess it's nice going on a shopping spree every now and then.  i still have to pick up a few t-shirts, but after that i should be set.  well maybe one more pair of jeans would be nice.  this is one item of clothing that will be especially difficult to find.   thai women are short, small, and have zero hips.  the last time i tried on dresses they had to go to the back and find the largest size for me.  kinda embarassing. so i joined the gym today to work on this issue. jk. i just want to keep in shape and there is a very nice gym very close to where i live.  i'm looking forward to getting on a regular workout schedule.  in oxford i had faye's hyper butt getting me out to the park everyday, but since i've been here all i seems i do is eat.  well gotta go.  love ya'll.  jane
