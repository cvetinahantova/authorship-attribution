I have a terrible and horrible illness.  It inhibits my life as I know it and I cannot stand to think that it will never go away.  Just what could this terrible illness be?     I'm ALLERGIC to  GOLD         Yep, that's right.  Color me a freak because I cannot wear gold.  It wouldn't be so bad, but I'm a GIRL! I must have nice pretty shiny things, like diamonds that usually come on GOLD.  But it's okay, I can deal because now there is PLATINUM.  Now if I can just convince S that I need something big and shiny set in platinum.      Sadly, however, this wretched illness also leaves me horribly disfigured.  I cannot wear earrings.  (Oh how I wish I could wear earrings...I HATE CLAIRES.)  I have never even tried them in platinum though. I wonder if that would work. Hmmmm.  I look at my cousin who is 14 and she wears the cutest earrings.  Long dangly ones, chandelier style, cute little barely there types.  I envy a 14 year old.
