I guess i'm pretty much indifferent about school starting. I can't change that it's going to come. I love change. I'm not afraid of it like other ppl. I feel that things can only get better in my life, i don't like my past so i hope my future is better. That is how i feel about pretty much everything. Life is never stopping. It always changes, so i guess since i can't change it i should make the best out of it.
