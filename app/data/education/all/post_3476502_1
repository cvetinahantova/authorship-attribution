Music:  World So Cold - Mudvayne  Mood:  bored outta my mind!  ********************************   I am currently watch 'Fifth Element', it's a very good movie! I like the part when the blue Diva sings... it's really pretty!  I feel bad... I killed a spider and a younger one was sitting right there... I wonder if it was it's parent or something... I felt bad and said that when it gets older, if it wants vengance, it can bite me or something...! heh, I watch Kill Bill too much...  >.> ... I'm crazy!  Lets see, what movies have I watched today... Vibes, Moonstruck, and now Fifth Element...! Today is 'stay home and watch movies' day...! w00t!  I think I'll write a fanfiction about this movie(Fifth Element)... make it all freaky anime like... hehehe...  YAY! I'm done painting my toenails...! I don't know why it's so hard for me to paint those... it just is!!  CURSE THEM!!  Heh! When I get older, I'm going to open up an Art Learning Center... yeah, that would rock... I'm gonna have to save up a bunch of money! I'm gonna go make something to eat...!   Love All!
