Day 2 back at school. Confidence gaining slowly.  Stealing an idea from my girlfriend, I think I'm going to make a "Current Events" bulletin board and attempt to incorporate it, somehow, with the "Morning Meeting / Message." The underlying theory is, even if I don't do it as successfully as I want to, it gives kids exposure to newspapers and magazines, and the purpose they serve. They probably don't have that exposure anywhere else.  I also think I'm going to use a "Journaling" approach, where students solve various problems in personal, self-designed journal notebooks, the theory there being that when you write down problems and the steps to solve them, you remember it all more.  Those two things, albeit simple, might make things a bit hotter this year (in a good sense).  Had a training this afternoon. While usually pointless, this training provided clear, usable information. I can't decide whether I think this information is usable because I know HOW to use it (because I'm a second year, and more makes sense) or because it actually IS more usable. I think it might be a combination of both.  My current MLB Playoff Predictions:  AL: Yankees, Red Sox, Twins, As NL: Braves, Cardinals, Cubs, Dodgers  Teams to Consider: White Sox, Giants, Padres, Rangers  I wish more news outlets would profile "key races" in the Senate and House, because I'd love to know more about those battle lines.
