My dad got in from a trip a few days ago, but he's staying at St. Michaels hospital in Toronto. Apparently he had a severe heart failure, and it is likely that he will need to be operated. Which by itself isn't so worrisome, but the bad thing is that it comes chained with quite a few other health conditions.  Eh, one way or another there is nothing that will be fixed by worrying, and those who know me are well aware that I tend to be a no worries person.  So to brighten things up I will say that I finished  Quicksilver  yesterday, and am merrily looking forward to inflicting it upon my stepbrother. He was looking for historical fiction, and has never had a taste of Neal Stephenson (literary-wise, you pervert!), so I thought to drop the book by his house when on the way to the hospital to visit my father. And while I'm at it I might as well go grab  The Confusion .
