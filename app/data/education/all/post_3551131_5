Hey.. Im back! Im back! Im back! Finally!!! Ahh... Home sweet home.. Aint nothing better than this. Genting was ok. Didnt do much. Just hang around. No theme parks, No rides.. Just me and my couz lepaking around. Brought my Playstation along. LOL! Desperate for something to do. hehe... Played some pool and bowling as well. Lotsa Singaporians and Chinese(as in from China). Saw some chun chicks around.. And watch Harry Potter!!! Woohoo!!! Finally!!! After more than a week... The movie was ok. Storyline changed a lot. As well as the landscape of the school compared to the last two movies. Lousy director. When is Hagrid's hut down the hill? I mean.. It was just next to the school in the second movie. Lame... I expected a younger lookin Lupin though... And Hermione's pretty... hehe...  Sigh... Tomorrow's school... 1st day of the new term. Another chance for a new beginning. The mark of the Mid term exam which is two weeks away. Gotta study hard i guess.. But with the unfinished projects and hw from the hols, im gona have a lil prob. Once again, its all the mad bitch's fault...Hmm...Don't know if ive changed myself much during the hols. Had hoped this 2 week hols would fix me up for the better.. from the sense of attitude..well.. i shall see when i get back to school.. this whole month will be one stressful month for me..and a busy one for me as well...Not writing much for this time...gettin late.. wana sleep.. havent got a good sleep for the past 3 days...and HAPPY BIRTHDAY to da LOW bros!!!!
