I've been reading this book by an author named Richard Bowes called  Minions of the Moon .  It's this story of a guy from an Irish Boston family growing up.  He's poor, addicted to everything under the sun, and basically a gay whore.  He even talks about having gone to the YMCA in Boston in his youth to earn money via sexual acts with older men.  This coupled with two other books by gay authors, Bob Smith and David Sedaris, I've recently read has led me to believe that my life as a gay man has been really uneventful.  On the spectrum of messed up to least messed up, Bowes would come first, then Sedaris, Smith, and me.  I'm just so damned normal.  Their binges of cocaine, acid, anonymous sex, violence, etc., expotentially overwhelm the whopping two sexual partners of mine and the small number of times I've puffed some green stuff.  It actually makes me want to dive into that illicit world head first.  But then it occurs to me that the lives that at least Smith and Sedaris have now created (through the characters) resembles the world that I currently have.  I think that a similar world will reveal itself for Bowes as I finish the book, but I can't be sure.  But since their worlds resemble what I currently have without the bad times, should I really care?  But isn't it those horrible times that often give rise to genius that is each artist?  Seadaris's wit is no doubt due to his years of drug-induced stupor coupled with driftlessness and unemployment.  Smith has his days of squeeking by as a cater-waiter in New York City.  Bowes went for it all, dropping his pants for whoever asked.  But my biggest struggles have been dealing with a large credit load and work simultaneously.  I've lived one of those coveted middle-class, seemingly stable lives.  I kind of hate myself for that.  So should I long for a low period?  No, I don't think so.  But maybe I should long for the insight that such periods have given those authors instead.
