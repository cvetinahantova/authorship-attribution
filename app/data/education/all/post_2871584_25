All right.  I know that I've said this in person to just about everyone who reads this, and at least once in a previous post, but it is SO nice to be back in Utica.  I may not be "from" Utica, but this is where I really found a lot of myself.  This is where I found myself, and as far as I'm concerned, this is where I am happy.  At least for the time being, I completely feel like I am back home after a long time away.    I was talking to Kris tonight, and I was trying to explain it to her.  The best I could come up with was this:  I was in New Jersey for almost two years, and barely left campus.  Even when I did, it was almost always work related.  I sat in my rooms (read: not apartment) and had a life that was not at all fulfilling.  Fast forward to now.  I am living in a situation where I go to work and then I... come home.  Where I have a life.  One that is mine, and that makes me happy.  I have friends, both here and far from here.  But I feel like I'm at home.  That's something that I haven't felt in... such a long time.  In fact, I honestly can't remember the last time I felt this safe, this content, this... settled.    In other exciting news, for the first time in *seven* *years*, I got mail on a Saturday.  I do not believe it.  I feel like I am suddenly a real person again!  Woohoo!
