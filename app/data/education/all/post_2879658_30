Nikko!           Saturday morning bright and early (I caught the 7:06 train to Sendai) Sharon, Stephania, Danola, Kristel and I began our weekend trip to Nikko.  Sharon was once again my trusty navigator as I have gotten very used to having her in the front seat telling me where to turn and translating the signs that I can`t understand.  About 3 hours later and a little over 5,000 yen spent in tolls, we had arrived just in time for a delicious ramen lunch.             Anyway, as far as Nikko, our afternoon was spent viewing some really impressive temples and shrines.  We were also supposed to see lots of monkeys and were warned to guard our possessions but the only monkey`s we saw were carved into a wall and were the hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil monkeys.  We definitely took a picture assuming the same stances as the monkeys so hopefully soon I will be able to provide a link to my photos.  After a few hours of walking, we then headed to a coffee shop followed by a pretty relaxing Italian dinner.  Then it was back to our Ryokan (Japanese style inn) where I quickly passed out.  I was just a little tired to say the least.        On Day 2 the weather was a bit dreary but we managed to make the best of it.  We drove up this huge mountain where everything was covered with snow and it was actually raining/snowing while I drove.  As most of you are probably aware, driving in snow and ice is probably my worst nightmare after the experiences of driving in Wisconsin!  Luckily it wasn`t too bad and slow and steady wins the race.  After a scenic drive we headed back into Nikko for lunch and then began the drive home in the rain.          All in all it was a great weekend and incredibly nice to be out of Miyagi even if it was only for about 36 hours.  Again I was with a great group of people and we were all looking for just a relaxing escape and to see one of the more famous attractions in Japan.   　  　If you would like a brief description of Nikko you can go to www.japan-guide.com but for some unknown reason the link won`t work at this time. Gomen ne!!!  (sorry in Japanese)
