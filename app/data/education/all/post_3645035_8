HIDE!!!   QUICKLY!!!   Good.  Now that you are all gone, I can speak candidly about many things while you(the avid reader) practice your art.     Do any of you know what a hill looks like?  Don't laugh.  What DOES a hill look like?  Are hills those things that pickle sized fairys live in? NO!  Pickle sized fairies live in coffins beside crucified cockroaches and water smoothed pebbles.  They also inhabit space(which coincedentally has no hills).  Do you know where to find hills?  No, not in space.  Weren't you listening?  In Italy!  Yes, that is where hills are found.  Do you know why?  Of course you don't, you think pickle sized fairies live in them.  Well I'll tell you.... Some time later, I'm jet lagging.   FIRST!  I hope you didn't do anything to that cow.  No, thats second, first things first.  Cheese comes from the nipples of large overfed mammals.  This is both gross AND disgusting, especially when coupled with aged warm feet squished grapes.  This is why I ate Lebanese in Paris.  Where is Leban you might ask.  I did.  I didn't get an answer. SO!  A contest!  The first one to tell me where Leban is gets 0.05 euros.  Free.  I hope you didn...oops already said that.   so   CONTEST!!!  TELL JOHN MOLLOY WHERE LEBAN IS AND GET 0.05 EUROES!!!!   You can stop hiding now, I couldn't find you.  Get some clothes on too, reading nude in the dark is bad for digestion.   Bye Bye Ciao Ciao
