Good day all. I wish it really was. I try not to judge the day before it has unfolded some, but I am going to be responsible for the teaching of the students today. The teacher is absent. We, at this here place, do not have substitutes for any position. The problem with me teaching is that I am also responsible for charting the student's goal based behavior. I also don't really want to do it. I am capable; having a credential and experience, but I would be doing it full-time if I wanted to do it. Thre are plenty of jobs in the special ed sector. Pay is low, no respect. Enough of my complaining.  I came into work this morning and noticed that one of our school vehicles had had it's windows left down all night. The doors were unlocked, too. Not that it mattered with the windows down. The fact that it rained last night for about an hour is the problem. The seats and door panels were soaked. The vehicle smells bad enough already. I was the last to drive it on Friday, but another branch of the agency borrowed the vehicle, and basically showed not respect for it. The school gets punked again.  We have a returning student; from two years ago. He is alright. At least he doesn't have violent tendencies, but he is quite talkative. He is also Lakers fan. Cool. It is also good to get another, since our numbers are down.
