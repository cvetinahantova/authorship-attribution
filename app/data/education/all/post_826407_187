Spent the last few days at Church sorting out things for the streetreach prayer room.    I'm pretty excited about the whole mission thig next week.  Teams will be going out into the areas around our Church to do Gardening, Litter Picking, Kids Work and other stuff.  At the same time we are running a  urlLink 24-7  style Prayer Chapel for people to plug into.    My hope is that the Prayer rooms will become a kind of collaborative creative experiment in prayer and worship.  For people to come on their own terms and use the environment to engage with God during the mission weeks.  Their open 9-4.30 Mon-Friday throughout August at Philadelphia
