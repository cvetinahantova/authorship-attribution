In the bustling metropolis of Grande Prairie they had a twister go through the downtown core today.  I guess it tossed a couple of cars, and tore a wall out.  I was a little disconcerted to hear this, because my brother and sister-in-law don't live too far from there.  Neither was in the area when it went through, and their place seems to be fine, so that's good.  I haven't seen any pictures yet, but I'm sure there will be lots tomorrow.  Reminds me of when we had a twister come through our small town in the NWT.  It ripped the roof off one old building (no one lived there), and knocked over a couple of outhouses, but I believe that was the extent of the damage.  I remember it raining really hard.  I love storms.  Its been too long since we had a good storm here in Quito.  Oh well.....
