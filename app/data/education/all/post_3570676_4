The lesson I am planning involves teaching the importances of being physically fit. I plan to do this by using the textbook Health: A Guide To Wellness, the internet sources that I have picked out for them, and my own personal experinces. In making this plan, I hope that each student will benefit from having learned the material and be able to apply the knowledge that was given to them to their everyday life.  I have compiled some internet sources for the students to work with. I personally have been to every site and approve of them because each site has valuable information.   urlLink Check this site out   This site is a Georgia State University site that is simply titled The Exercise & Physical Fitness Page. It contains exercise program information. It involves the different types of exercise, the importance of warming up, the importance of nutrition, and other important factors in doing an exercise program. Their goal is to provide research based exercise and fitness information.   urlLink Check this site out   This site is developed by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. It is titled Fitness Fundamentals:Making a Commitment. It covers everything you need to know about making an exercise program and all of the things included in making an exercise program.   urlLink Check out this site   This site covers the five basic components of physical fitness. It has several other links published on the page that enable the reader to explore more options that go along with physical fitness.  I plan to have the students go to each one of these sites and compare and contrast each site to the other. I will then have them compare that to the material in the textbook. They will list some of the same points each text covers and list some differences. After they understand the components of exercise I will have them make their own exercise program using the information that was given to them.
