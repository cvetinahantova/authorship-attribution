Coworker making me very angry right now...being stupid and making it out to be my fault...  Let me ask you this: If someone calls your office with a matter that needs immediate attention (and that you can fix quickly), do you fix the problem immediately or do you inform your coworker that there is a problem and that you are going to fix it?  My preference is to fix the problem so that when you DO tell coworker(s) about it, not only are you informing of a problem, but you're informing them that there's already a solution in place. For example, what sentence would you rather hear? "AAAAAAAHHHHHHH, THE BUILDING'S ON FIRE!!!!" or "AAAAAAAHHHHHHH, THE BUILDING'S ON FIRE AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN CALLED...PLEASE FOLLOW ME TO THE STAIRWELL!!!!"  You decide.  OH, by the way, the coworker wanted me to tell them about the problem because they "didn't know what was going on and didn't want to sound dumb on the phone." Shoot me, please.
