Its Friday, Tommy had his normal 4 month check up this morning.  He came home very upset, and scared me.  I am aworrie about my husband now.  He told me today that he was tired of living life.  That yesterday, he had actually prayed for God to take him on out, because he was fed up and didn't want to live anymore.  This scares me.  I know in my heart that Tommy wouldn't hurt himself, but I also know what a hold depression can have on a person.  I went to Tommy's dr's office, and talked with the nurse, then the doc himself.  He took time out of his busy day to talk to me.  Of course, he wants to see Tommy again and talk to him face to face, so I made him an appointment for Monday morning.  Then, I told Tommy what I did, and he told me to cancel the appointment, that he wasn't going to go talk about his pshycie.  So now what do  I do????????  All I can do is pray and watch him closely.  He needs medication, buy he refuses to go to the doctor, he refuses to talk to anyone about his troubles, so that leaves me with my hands tied.
