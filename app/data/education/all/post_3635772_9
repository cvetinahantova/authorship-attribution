pucha! leche talaga ang araw na ito!   i really HATE MY JOB!!!   i hate dealing with people who don't give you the time of day!   i hate dealing with people who are so full of themselves that you have to repeat things for them, things that  THEY NEED , at their own convenience!   i hate being asked to prepare for something for someone else and then they leave you hanging once you are not needed anymore!    PUTANG-INA!!  I REALLY HATE ASSHOLES LIKE THAT!!!      siguro this must be the reason why i find it hard to depend on others -- di maaasahan ang ibang tao.  wala pa akong naka-trabahong tao na maaasahan ko ng lubusan.   kakatapos lang ng freshmen welcoming event Welcome Xiao Di namin which is something like the ORSEM of ADMU.  it was a whole day event that involves a lot of logistical and political bullshit.  NAAASAR AKO SA RED TAPE!!  too many people feel that their approval is desperately needed to forward an event that doesn't involve them the slightest.   tang-ina talaga.  sobrang pissed off talaga ako today.  i had to walk and do tai-chi sa open air and grassy football field namin.  it didn't matter if somebody saw me.    fuck them.  i don't give a shit about them.
