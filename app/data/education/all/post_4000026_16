Tension surrounds the place around the graduating level, the chinese results were out. Not many were anxious to recieve it, though some were too scared to see what they got. Me? I didn't really care... not that i like the subject anyway. But still the anxiety was still there.All I could think of was Iris saying "I won't get a F9." That was so sweet of her, yet I still had the thought of getting my dream come true. Well I got back my result, as I said, if I scored a F9, it'd be a dream come true for I dreamt all the days before that I'd get a F9 for chinese. Lol bummer... my dream didn't come true,Iris was right..I scored a D7! So my eyes turned to Alv first, but for the first time, Alv went to others before coming to me, I was looking high and low for him to let him know what I got. For me to smile and be happy for him upon hearing his score comparing to mine, yet he was with others carrying the joy around. Ah well... life goes on.lol. I sound so stuck up huh? Anyway then came the afteroon, English oral started. I was first in line, man I was so nervous, lol okay okay the truth, not really in fact. Thanks to the time keeper teacher. She was nice. She had a short chat with me and I felt kinda relaxed and more confident. Well I had to enter the room, I was shaking not physically, but mentally. Lol I was polite to my best all the way. They were really really nice and friendly invigilators, comparing to the chineses ones, geez.. they were bad. Anyway they were nice, I treated them as friends rather, for they carried that kinda attitude. Everything went flowrously, I felt that the path out of the room turned floral. Geez I was with smiles even till the evening. Guess I felt really confident and joyous about my performance. Well not that I didn't still feel the little(the slightest in fact) sad with my chinese results. But hey... no giving up yeah. Peace out ya'll.
