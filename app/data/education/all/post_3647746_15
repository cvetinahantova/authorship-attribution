Hey, if you use Microsoft Internet Explorer, don't be a dope,  urlLink update it . And install  urlLink Spybot Search & Destroy ,  urlLink Spysweeper , AND  urlLink HiJackThis . Then run each of them.  If you want to try out other browsers, which I suggest, then I suggest  urlLink Firefox  or  urlLink Opera . Both have their  urlLink plusses and minuses  but both work well once you get used to them. Currently, I am trying to get used to Firefox and how it ain't so Google friendly (takes an extra click to access some of my favorite features like Blog This!, News, Images, Search This Site, etc. (Well, that's what I call the features. Google prolly has other, longer names.) Opera is fast but too many sites are "slightly" incompatible with it. And for quasi-neatniks, it can drive them batty.  If you don't have anti-virus protection, get  urlLink some . And if you get a buttload of spam, it is your own damn fault. You're too liberal. With where you poke your head. Porn and shopping and sites will be the death of your PC and/or your time.   If you are looking for a new media player, then I suggest  urlLink Media Center .  urlLink iTunes  (nearing 100M songs sold, BTW) is for kids. At least on Windows. It has too few features to be worth using. RealPlayer is for databases that need rebuilding and people who restart their PC several times a day. No link provided. If you are that stupid,  urlLink here .  urlLink Windows Media Player  is anti-mp3.  urlLink WinAmp  is for skin dweebs.  urlLink MusicMatch  is a better RealPlayer.  File this under: it's 1:27 AM and I've not posted squat here. Plus, I see Howard has simplified the look and wanted to let him know: Good job!  P.S.  urlLink Molly got WordPress! , which is where my 'poisonal' blog is going once I crawl out from under CSS and XHTML and  urlLink design guru wars .  Note to self: if I'd manage my time better, I'd... No, if I focused more, my time would not cover more yet not as much.  urlLink If that makes sense .  P.P.S. This blog appears different when viewed by MSIE (like the Blogger screenshot) or Firefox (no 'graphics', squared corners, poor type handling). Will be testing Opera soon.
