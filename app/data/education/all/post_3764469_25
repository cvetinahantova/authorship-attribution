Ontong blocks a spike from '90 in the second set      Ah yes, that five letter word that characterizes our weekends...    It's always "bitin;" you've felt it, but it wasn't enough.     This is true for my weekend (and I'm sure it's true for yours). Sabi nga ni Alekos, he hates sundays because it signals the arrival of Monday. And we all know what's wrong with Monday.     Anyway, this post is about the events that transpired during the weekend volleyball game featuring Batch '98 and that's what I should be writing about.    The title of the post says it all for that game. We fell short. In Tagalog,  nabitin kami .   The Batch '90 prevailed over Batch '98 in three sets.      The game started out as horrifying as one could imagine. '90 was hitting serves and we weren't exactly returning them. They weren't hitting hard. It's just that '98 wasn't returning the ball. A typical case of "unforced errors." I'd also have to admit that my play really sucked for that set. I failed to send in two serves (out of two!). The score was horrendous but we did manage to get to double digits (10). Absolutely no highlights for that set.        2nd set huddle; Parang totoo no?      The second set was much more closer than the first, with '98 getting the lead for most part until it made a push in the latter part of the set. Of course, fatigue on the part of '90 was a bit obvious. Their tosser (who resembled a 32 year old version of Rolly Doolittle Marasigan) got injured and was not very effective. Also, '98's serves had a much higher accuracy in the second set. Of course, who could forget Ontong's "unpredictable"  hulogs  and Brian Caparas' string of blocks. '98 prevailed in this set, 25-19 ( i think) to force a clincher set. The third set saw '90 zooming to a 7-2 lead until '98 catched up and evened the score at 7. '90 had a 7-2 run that set up 4 match points, 9-14. With the game on the line, '98 made a 5-0 run that evened the count at 14. The last tie was at 15-15 until '90 scored two more points that sealed the win for them.    Well,  ayun nga, bitin...  But it was a good overall game (I really wonder what happened to that first set...). Though Oli packs a few pounds down there, he can still pack a whallop. I was fairly convinced he had the strongest spike out there (and he had to prove it a couple of times pa!). Elea, though arriving a bit late and probably shaken from the traffic, managed to play a nice game. Shaty, claiming she had only two hours of sleep, didn't show it at all (both in her game play and how she looked). Pat, inspired by Chico, played a game worthy of her CS jersey. Even though she' plagued by various insinuations brought about by that "draw your own conclusions part 2" post, Salve managed to play a game that reminded me why she was on the Eng'g varsity when she was a student. Brian, a surprise player last time, came much more prepared.  Parang kinarir ang  volleyball. This time, he was in athletic gear and he brought his A game. '98 missed the services of Marwin and Bano (and those others out there!!). Ma'am Dacs, Jae, Jam, and Alekos (Opal ka pa rin...) was there for the much needed moral support. And of course, Jae was there to take pictures...         The look of dejection! Alekos' reaction says it all.      Oh yeah, Jonas was there. I forgot to bring his shirt (which by then was already clean!). I wonder what's wrong... he must be living in some third world country or something. Hmmm, OFW's might make a good topic for a blog. However, don't expect me to write one. :)    Well. 'Till the end of the month. The next games are scheduled as follows:     Aug. 28 (Sat) 2:30PM versus '88     Aug. 29 (Sun) 9 AM versus '93
