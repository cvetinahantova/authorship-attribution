Music: I'm with Stupid - Static X Mood: Blah **********************  O.o... I don't know why I feel this way...   I might be able to get some money for some clothes and such... but the thing is... I'd have to go to Austin for a few weeks...! It's for my Aunt Dawn... she'd let me work at her company for a few weeks so I can get some money, because I don't have a car, I can't get a job, and I wont be able to get a car until we sell the house, and who knows how long that'll take!! But if I go, it'll be fun! I think... O.o... ofcourse every time I've been in Austin, I was with my mom, and had to do what they wanted, now I can do what I want...! And her house is so fucking awsome!!!! If I could find the picks I took of it last time I was there, I would post 'em! It is so beautiful! It's a two story Spanish custom! Tile floors everywhere! And it's in the hillcountry of Austin! It's so cool!   I would fly up there probably... that way it would only take 20 minutes...!  Why does my mom insist of opening my blinds and curtains?? "Your room is too dark!!!" so I go and close all the curtains and blinds in the whole house...! I've gotten back into my 'Nocturnal' stages... I've watched the sunset everyday for a week now...! Now it's just boring... >.>... and the crack-heads go outside in the morning, and they scare me....!  I just heard a commercial that sounds just like my childhood:  Mother: Hey, I'm light on cash, can I borrow 5 bucks from your piggy bank? Child: Well, I donno, Mr. Piggy is feeling a bit light! Mother: C'mon! Child: Alright, but sign this loan form... Mother: Alright...  This is how it was when I was a kid, my parents together owe me about 200 dollars... >.>... when I would have a birthday, my grandparents both would give me 50 dollars and my parents would take it and "Put it in the bank for me"... it was spent on alcohol...!   Alright, I'm going to be honest with my self now, I have a extremely strong love for Johnny Depp!! I can't help it! When I watch 'The astronaut's Wife' I was like in a complete state of bliss because his wife was named Jillian, and he kept saying "I love you, Jillian." I'm addicted...!   I think I've shrunken my stomach to the size of a pea.... O.o.... I just tried to eat some Ravioli and I had about 4 bites and I felt like I was going to explode!!! I think it's because I've started drinking 8 bottles of water a day...! YaY for me... O.o...!  There is this ring called the Black Passion Ring, and it's so pretty!! It has a black diamond in it... I want it, but it's probably like 5000 dollars... >.>... slightly out of my price range...!   I'm watching Judge Hatcett... >.>... I'm so glad I've stop smoking pot... so I didn't end up like those kids.... ::shakes fist at Jones for getting me into it::  Well, I'm going to go take a shower... GIA IS A FUCKING AWSOME MOVIE! Doom and it's really sad!
