So there's an upside to the Circle Game, too.  Last week I was a little disappointed that I didn't hear from H2. She kept saying she would call but something always seemed to come up. I thought it was because she had a rotten time on the camping trip and didn't want to see me again.  Finally we saw each other briefly on Saturday and for a nice long Giants game on Sunday. We also had a terrific, profound conversation on Sunday, during which we both realized that we have many of the same thoughts and thought processes. Also during which I realized that she really does care about what I'm thinking (evidence: she finally asked and listened while I responded and didn't let me stop talking)! She also was extremely appreciative of the fact that I had given her so much space last week and was giving her so much time surrounding us sleeping together.  We also talked about emotional intimacy, and how we hadn't achieved it yet but were working toward it. I still wonder how emotional intimacy happens.
