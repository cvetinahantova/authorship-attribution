the brother called... he's currently giving me a list of $$-making ideas for the summer  current list:  * sell my organs on the black market * sell all my possessions on ebay * sell flamingo insurance * ask everyone on my mass-email list to donate $20 to the "la endowment fund" * wander around public places talking my head off and get them to pay me to go away * panhandle * find a rich benefactor  thoughts?  while i'm thinking about it, eric did suggest yesterday that maybe if i had a bar mitzvah, i'd get enough money to cover bills... (obviously it was a joke... and even if it weren't i don't think converting to judaism for the month of june would convince the people who know me to give me money =P)  joy. now, really, i'm working.
