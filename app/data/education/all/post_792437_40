Stuff currently    Yes yes, I have not written on here forever :( I miss it! Honestly, I"ve had a lot to say, but I've become too annoyed of finding time to write it all down! Believe me, I have a list of ideas I want to write about, but it'll be a while before I jot them all down on here. Time goes by fast. It seems to me that I started this post in the summer of 97 or 98, and now it's the summer of 2003. Time goes by fast. I started it when I was going to be a first year college undergraduate student, and now I'm sitting with one year of my graduate studies done, and in one more year I'll be done with my masters.    I plan to keep this updated all that time. Now that school is over and I'm just here and there either studying on my own or doing some research..My ideas of postings will change..and might be more focused on ideas pertaining not to human behavior. I guess time will tell as to what I post, and when I post. Till then, you all have a good one.. :)
