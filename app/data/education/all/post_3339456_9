There has been a massacre of Palestinians in Gaza.  33 people have dies in the last two days.  First, levelling of Palestinian homes, and now this.  The UN has condemned this in a  urlLink resolution  apparently by a vote of 14-0, with the US abstaining, but the international community must condemn this in the strongest possible terms.  Again, an example of why we need an international criminal justice system.  See this  urlLink Guardian  article.
