urlLink Positive Character Development in School Sport Programs. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Jennifer Beller.  It reviews how sports can help to buold character.  From the ERIC Digest:  Sportsmanship and the development of positive character have long been explicit goals of school sports. A strong belief exists that sport programs have the power to promote the development of "...sportsmanlike behaviors, ethical decision-making skills, and a total curriculum for moral character development" (Stoll, 1995, p. 335) and provide a social environment to acquire personal and social values and behaviors contributing to good character and good citizenship (Arnold, 1984; Sage, 1998). The arena of sport can provide one of "the greatest opportunities for a student to learn honesty, integrity... and ethical behavior" or it can provide "one of the greatest opportunities in school for a youngster to learn how to be dishonest...or how to be hypocritical" (Sabock, 1985, p. 271). Little empirical research exists supporting that mere participation in and of itself leads to the development of moral character. In fact, the opposite appears true, that sport participation may be more likely to negatively affect moral character (Bredemeier, 1984; Priest, Krause, & Beach, 1999; Stoll & Beller, 2000). Whether positive or negative, "[s]ports have immense power to shape consciousness, values, and beliefs of athletes and to pass on selected aspects of the dominant culture" (Sage, 1998, p. 264). This digest discusses the formal and informal processes of moral character development, in light of the types of programs that have shown to improve moral character, sportsmanship, and fair play.
