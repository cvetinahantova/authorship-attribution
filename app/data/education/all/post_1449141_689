Solider Facing Court-Martial Blew Whistle on Torture     On Wednesday, the court-martial of Staff Sgt. Camilo Mejia begins at Ft. Stewart in Georgia. After returning for a period from Iraq, Mejia was AWOL for several months, and then filed for conscientious objector status. He has publicly spoken out on the war, saying: "I could not continue to do the things I was doing in Iraq.... I'm completely against it because it's an oil-motivated war."
