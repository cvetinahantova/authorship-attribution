This is the final blog of the year.  I really have nothing to say but I just wanted to type something.  To everyone, it has been a fun year.  I hope 04 brings the best for everyone.  I should talk about my favorite events of the year and the people who have influenced me the most but I don't have time.  I'm currently at Asma's.  Maybe I'll do it later.  Happy New Year!!!
