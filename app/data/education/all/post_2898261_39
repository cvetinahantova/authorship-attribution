So it be said, So it be written. Words of wisdom through the eyes of love. From broken hearts that roam in the night. To lovers that embrace to their hearts content. Holdng on to sweet life of dreams of forever to be mine. Like roses that bloom under moon lit skies. He looks for my love,  Yet I am nowhere to be found. For my love awaits him calling like a puppy wanting attention. To feel his warmth in his cuddling arms. To know that his gentle caressive touch will comfort me. I'd be always faithful to his love. My heart starts to glow inside. For you have to give and take a little in love. To have each others arms. For where you are is where I want to be. For you are the love of my life.
