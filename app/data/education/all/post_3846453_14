I'm sitting at home listening to the Scissor Sisters, eating an apple and talking on MSN. Life can't get more relaxed, can it? My sister and dad have gone to the Isle of Wight for a week whilst I'm doing my Digital Photography course done by the Youth Service, so that should be fun. If anyone's reading this, can you leave a comment telling me of any songs with good bass bits? Coz my dad has this notion that he wants to buy a bass guitar. He can just about play an acoustic guitar.  I wouldn't mind a go on it, it could be good seeing as I'm not getting along with my good friend the trumpet and the piano is getting tedious. But I can't get the whole idea of 4 strings. Where do the set of notes stop and start on each string? Did you know that the 3rd track on the Scissor Sisters album "Comfortably Numb" was originally done by Pink Floyd? My dad (the budding bassist) showed me in Devon after playing it in the car and recognised it and played me the original. Personally, I think the Scissor Sisters did it better, but that's my opinion. Any Pink Floyd fans out there, I'm sure you enjoy the song a lot. But I prefer this one.
