Last night was great. I decided to stop up late to cool down from my run and to wait until I was tired enough to go to bed. I ended up chatting to Angela on MSN. Angela is a person who I met on the dating site. We have chatted, she knows all about me, but won't meet cos of my position. However as we have chatted, we have discovered that we get on really well. We have loads in common, like similar things and chat for ages, when it only seems like 5 mins. She knows that as we have chatted my fondness for her has grown. I told her last night that I wouldn't want to jump into bed with her just for sex because she was becoming more special (I meant it as well). We also discussed her holiday and I was able to give her some pointers as she was looking at South Devon. She basically booked it there and then over the net, having looked as some websites I sent her. It was fantastic, we have never met, I've never spoken to her or heard her voice, but we seem to have some sort of bond.  I had teased her previously by giving her my mobile number, but she scrubbed it. However things came full circle as we said good night at 01:00 and she offered to give me her details. I texted this morning to see how she was - the reply was "knackered"!
