I can't believe how fast three weeks goes, I loved being in Ireland. It's gorgeous there. It's so hard for me to fathom that people don't believe in God when it is more than evident in his creation in nature. I loved seeing green everything quite a constrast from our desert life here in Arizona. I was so blessed to have some amazing team members who served in the same town in Portadown with me. Emma and Colin were perfect for the leader job, they challenged us to make this trip more than just serving the children but also to work on our spiritual walks and the importance of unity in our team. I really enjoyed getting to know some people from Ireland besides our leaders: Laura is a sweet woman who is very wise for her age I loved chatting with her, Elaine who is a sweet loving gentle spirit who is a joy to be around, Alex who is like my Irish little brother who if I could I would take him home with me cuz he is so much fun. Then I was blessed to get to know people from America as well: Lyndsey who can make anybody laugh no matter what the situation is, Joy who is fun to hangout I love her humor, Alyssa who is so talented with kids and is good at making friends with all kinds of people, Max who is quiet but wise beyond his youth, and Johnathan who is fun to talk to because we have gone through a lot of the same stuff. I love my team and I know it wasn't by chance that we came together it was totally a God thing. Lord, I thank you for the relationships that have developed throughout these past three weeks. I thank you for bringing Emma, Colin, Laura, Elaine, Alex, Lyndsey, Joy, Alyssa, Max and Johnathan into my life. I pray Lord that our friendships with continue to grow even though we can't see each other everyday, I pray that we will continue to lift each other up in prayer through the day. Thank you Lord for all you have done in Portadown and what you are still doing. Love you.
