I´m so back over here.  Well, yesterday I couldn´t write anything because my time was short. So let´s catch up with the news now. In the morning I went to my English school and it was pretty funny. I had a lot of fun. Then I was going to tell my boss about my decision( I was not feeling able to give a business class). When I got there, she had gone for lunch and nobody hadn´t been able to tell me when she would be back. I couldn´t think about how I would start that conversation and so on. By the time she got there, I told her my decision and of course I told how panicked I was about the class. I don´t think she liked but she put up with it much better than I thought. Of course, as I´ve already seen before, she must have been cursing my name all over the place, but who cares... Anyway, guessing that my time  at Evoluta is about to end,  I really need to do something else. How can I start I wonder??? Later, I gave tests to my students and came home. When I got here, everything was pretty calm. My sister said I was a chicken to the decision above. I know. The effects will come down soon, I suppose. Let´s get over with it! Plus: today I´ve had classes again and I ´ve already told them about my proposition. I like those students. They´re nice.  BOOK THE MONTH: The Da Vinci Code  Good and gripping!!
