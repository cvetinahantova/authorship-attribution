Just finished  The Return of the King .  It left me feeling lonely at the end -- when you spend a great deal of time with a group of characters, often you are loath to part with them.  On the subject of Tolkien, I just bought Matthew Dickerson's  urlLink  Following Gandalf  , but I probably won't get to it for a couple of months at least.  Dickerson interprets Tolkien's Middle Earth tales through the lense of free will and moral responsibility and makes what appears to be a convincing case for a Christian interpretation of the works.  Also, for bedtime reading, I've begun Defoe's  urlLink  Robinson Crusoe  .  I've owned this book for years but have never read it.  My interest was rekindled after a recent vacation that my wife and I spent on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina.  Ocracoke is best known as the site, in November 1718, of a bloody naval battle that resulted in the death of Capt. Edward Teach (a.k.a.  urlLink Blackbeard ).  Anyway, the story is told in   urlLink A General History of the Pyrates  , which was for many years attributed to Daniel Defoe.  As it turns out, that's not the case; the book still makes for great reading though.  Aarrgh!  Link of the Day:  urlLink "Torture, War, and Presidential Powers"  by Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) (via the always-provocative LewRockwell.com).
