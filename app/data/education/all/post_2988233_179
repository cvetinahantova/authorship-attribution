I have to clean every inch of my bathroom.  Savannah came down to play with Noah.  If you ahve read anything about her, you know she is a mud freak.  So, I let the boys make a mud hole for them to all play in.  What a cool mom am I?  I have some good pics of Will, Jamie, Noah and Savannah getting themselves covered in mud.  Icky, thicky sticky, brown mud.  At least it isn't red clay, I guess.  Savannah was even nice enough to give me brown muddy handprints all over my legs.  I let Jamie come in and shower first, then Noah and Savannah decided at the exact same time they needed a bath right then.  Since they had both gotten pretty much naked in the mud, I let them bathe together with their drawers on.  You chould see my tub.  The floor inthe bathroom is all mud, the tub is all mud, the clothes they took off, will have to be hosed down before going in the wash, then it will probably still take two washings to get them even to play clothes status.    But is was worth it.  Wait until you see the pics.    Those smiles are priceless.
