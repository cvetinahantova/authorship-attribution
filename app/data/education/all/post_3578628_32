Ok...what more can I, Josh Hall, ask for?  I've got this whole week with 3 of the best girls that I know all to myself!  Don't take this wrong...and don't think i'm thinking anything that I'm not thinking, I just think that I should feel lucky because it will give you girls a chance to see "the real me,"  not the me with Kevin, Josh, David, Spencer...all of them.  I seem to act different around them for some reason, and for some even greater reason I act worse around them then what my true self is.  I'll obviously have to delete this before they get back...LOL, but I just think its about time that I prove myself for who I really am.  By the way...I mainly mean on here; I won't like come over to your house and stalk you type of thing ;-)  Anyway...look forward to this week with you gu...i mean girls.    OH...tell me when Izzy and Allison get back!  Thanks!
