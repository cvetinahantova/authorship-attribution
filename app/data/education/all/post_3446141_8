Why is it that I can work at the largest candy franchise and still not be able to get my favorite candy!!  I want some gummy bears! Or gummy worms would be fine as well.  As long as it's gummy.  Oh well, I am instead forced to eat some "extreme bursts" to satisfy my craving instead.  But it's just not the same.   Well this weekend wasn't much to write home about.  lol.  Friday night was a girlâ€™s night.  Saturday I actually got up and went to the store and bought some storage items for my room, very helpful and productive!  Then I made a detour to Pier One.....big mistake..LOL!  I bought inscents, a inscent holder, a candle, and three small vases.  Where any of those things on my list of things to buy?  NO.  Oh well.  Then that night I just chilled at the house and went to bed early.  Sunday, went to church, then I lazed around some more that afternoon.  Then at about 7ish I went to a movie with my friend Lacey and her boyfriend and his roommate.  Went to see Saved.  I liked it a lot.  Then when I got back I had this amazing spent of energy!!  And I cleaned the hell out of my room.  And it looks amazing!  My closet is so organized.  But I still have to get some crap to hold all my t-shirts and winter cloths.  So that is the mission for this afternoon. OH and on another note:  Victoria's Secret is having their Semi-Annual sell!  Started today.  I went at lunch. AND: Sex and the City starts on TBS on Tuesday.  However I'm not that sure on how good it will be considering they will have to cut a lot......hummmm we will see.
