Everyday I must emerge from my sleep and fully awaken within myself the passion and drive that will permit me to delve deep again.  I must ask for the energy, work to build the energy, cause it to rise up in my own body from the earth and from the sky, from the universe itself.  I will learn to feel the most subtle of vibrations throughout every cell of my being.  I will learn a new life that is true freedom.  I will affirm for myself for as long as it seems appropriate, that I am a child of light, that what I seek lies within and enfolds me with all forms of existence.  Immerse me in the light, I am ready for the baptism of fire that seers only a flame in my mind to hold a fixed point and feel the energy expanding, feel the joy expanding, feel the life force expanding ever outward, circling, spiraling ribbons of light and energy.  Perhaps I've been a bit optimistic, but perhaps this is the way, the truth and the life, perhaps it does much more than balance out the inevitable entropy?  I will continue to seek truth, and god will light my way if I look for the sign.  It will not be far and the darkness will lift in waves of triumph.
