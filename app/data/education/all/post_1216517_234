I just bought  A Century Ends . Amazing ablum. I think you especially would love it, O'Brien. Hey, I'll burn it for you as a contribution to the "O'Brien got his music stolen" collection. Anyway, the woman and I just broke up (mutual), and here is a song that I think is amazing. Don't worry, I'm not too heavy hearted over it.  Gathering Dust  I got no reason but that I must maybe I feel like I've been gathering dust I must leave this harbour for the sea I'm too young to settle down and make a home But I don't know where I'm wanting to be I just know I have to be there alone  Stole my time, all my time stole my time, for you  Pale winter sun is beatin' the ground why 'm I throwin' away  the best thing that I've found My young heart's in tatters and I'm sure that it will be a long time healing it's so hard to see what I'm doing this for when loneliness is all that I'm feeling  Stole my time, all my time, spend my time, for you  chorus: Now the wind it is blowing blowing leaves from the trees I've got no use knowing that with time it'll ease I don't know where I'm going hope I get there soon cos my soul is hollow as the sorrowful moon na na na na...  The night is raining on my weary head Taking me back  See the sun spread its wings of gold as the dawn unfurls Hear the song that the moon sings to the darkened world Feel the fire lighting in the bitter cold It's like the light that shines through the windows of your soul
