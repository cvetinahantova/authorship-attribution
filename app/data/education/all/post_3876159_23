In all this hassle and bussle, I can't help but step by and take a second look at this whole thing. I just can't help but wonder...is it all worth it? I mean, as much money as I am having to borrow and as many people as I am putting out to help me in one way or another, I am not truly convinced at this was the best decision.  I mean, at the time I was completely convinced that this was the direction I was suppose to take my life and I said that once I commit to the decision, I must stick with it. But looking back and evaluating my decision, I have to wonder if I didn't want to go so bad that I MADE everything just fall into place...instead of just letting them happen, thus landing me in this very place in my life.  I never thought this would be easy but financially, I feel so ....like this was a mistake. If I pull out now, I will lose so much money and dignity. I really want to go. I think this will be the best thing I will ever do in all my lifetime. But I seriously sugar coated the financial end of the thing. I honestly and humbly believe that at the time the money was all going to work itself out...but it hasn't yet.  I am not totally inclined to throw in the towel just yet, but am having doubts that exceed all my expectations.  If it is meant to be that I go...all will fall into place.
