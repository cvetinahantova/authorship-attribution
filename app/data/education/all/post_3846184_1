I saw this saying on a bumper sticker the other day (oddly enough, on the office door at my step-daughter's day camp) and I just felt like, oh boy can I relate!!!!  Maybe it's hormonal, maybe it's stress, maybe it's being a full-time step-mom for the summer, maybe it's that my work hasn't been very challenging lately, maybe it's that I so very much want a baby of my own and yet I am terrified about losing another.  Hmm, maybe it's a combination of all of these factors. What do you think?  I have been so tired lately, and of course that adds to the ttc obsession, and it hasn't helped me to feel very productive lately. Everything seems to take an effort, and when I don't do everything I want to, the guilt sets in (I'll save that for my next entry...)  I just need more time in the day, that's what I'm always saying...and now I have to run since we're off to my grandmother's 89th birthday party. Yup, 89. Can you believe that?  More later...  p.s. Many thanks to my girl Janet for reading and commenting. I need and want to comment on your recent entries, but just haven't had a chance. Always thinking of ya, though...
