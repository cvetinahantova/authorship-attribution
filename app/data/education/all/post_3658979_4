Why am I so enamoured with an oversized rat?  I absolutely adore Mickey Mouse.  Is it his red shorts?  His nonchalant attitude of bearing his chest at all times?  Or is it his high-pitched voice always cheering "Hello boys and girls!"?  Who knows.  I just got back from Chicago where I saw twelve four feet tall statues of the great mouse.  Hopefully, I'll be able to post a picture of one here sometime soon.  That is, if I figure out how to upload the dang thing.  Computers.  Ugh!  Is it pathetic to be 26, hell, almost 27 and in love with Mickey Mouse?  I sure hope not.
