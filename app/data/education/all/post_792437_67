Cruel Joke...    Â  A friend played a cruel joke on me. I did fall for it for a few mins, and felt so scared..but then got over it...but still cruel jokes suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And then on the brighter note....I have finalized two of my interviews, just need to send in my itineraries to the schools so that they can reimburse me for the travel and food or whatever money. It should be a lot of fun.
