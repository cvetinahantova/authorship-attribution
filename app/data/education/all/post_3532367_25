Oh my God this is SHIT! I've had nothing but sarcastic comments from my manager about being off. He's been trying to make out that I've not been ill but have been doing my car (I'm not going to tell him am I!).  I've had to walk out of the office to escape the atmosphere. I called Sandra almost in tears and it's really getting too much for me. She suggested I talk to Dave, who knows my predicament at the moment. Dave took me for a walk for an hour while we discussed my boss and God and it gave me the chance to calm down. Dave is a Christian and has also worked with my boss and knows what he can be like.  The end result is a headache that is splitting me in two - I can't concentrate.
