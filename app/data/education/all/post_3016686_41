urlLink Girls Aloud :  Why do we like them? Because we like British girl groups. Because they actually have decent songwriters, even though they were discovered on an American/Pop Idol ripoff TV show. We like that they release a new CD every year, flouting American pop rules (short shelf life!). We love THIS group because they have one roughneck chick who beats other girls in da clubs.  Their last hit was a really good version of the Pointer Sisters "Jump." Sadly, they have ditched their 80's look, though not the 80's sound. But we really  like this chorus:    Should've known, should've cared, should've hung 'round the kitchen in my underwear...
