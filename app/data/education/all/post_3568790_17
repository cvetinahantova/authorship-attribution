Bloggystyle - my favorite...  Just think, if the government spent the $192 billion on domestic problems rather than Iraq how the country would be different.  More jobs for people in the U.S.  More money for infrastructure - roads and transportation, energy systems, forests, rivers, etc., etc.  What a bunch of crooks we've elected.  Their kids' futures seem fine, don't they?
