So I've spent the past 6 hours helping my mother in law clean up her wreck of a basement...There's still HUGE piles left everywhere.  I don't know how they're going to get it all done in the next week.  Okay. Time for a mini-rant, boys and girls.  Can you say pissed off?  J's brother's wedding is June 5th.  J is the best man, her sister is the matron of honor.  Among many other friends etc... her brother in law is also a groomsman.  I am J's brother's sister in law, obviously.  I am the ONLY family member not in the wedding.  The fact that I'm not a bridesmaid isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that I'm the only family member not involved. I've been completely left out. I cannot ride in the limo with everyone, and I have to spend the day alone.  My husband will be away from me during the ENTIRE night, as he is sitting at the head table and I'm not, and he also is supposed to be dancing with the matron of honor (though he claims he will NOT under any circumstances).  So. I won't sit with him or be with him during the wedding, I can't ride with him to reception as the wedding party is going to the lake for pictures, I don't get to sit with him for dinner, and I don't get to dance with him.  I think it's really crappy that I'm so left out.  Okay, I AM singing in the wedding-the only person to sing.  I'd rather be doing that than standing up as a bridesmaid.  But I don't understand why I can't be included. A letter arrived yesterday for J saying where he had to be and when and, with regards to the limo for after-pictures, that spouses were NOT allowed to ride along.  Maybe I'm just grumpy.  Who knows. /endrant  Okay.  Tomorrow the window is fixed in the bathroom and we are to have the kitchen table and chairs delivered. I certainly hope that I don't have a class scheduled for when they are supposed to arrive! I'm going to be really pissed.  Not much I can do though...and...I'M GETTING A TABLE AND CHAIRS!!! HALLELUJAH!! :)  Okay. I think I'm done for now. Hooray!
