I checked my hotmail account today.  Had a message from member services telling me to either reduce the size of my email account or purchase more space.   They only give you 2 mb of space to begin with.     I found out that my BULK email folder at 999 DUPLICATE messages from SPAM. All the commercial spam is sent there automatically by Hotmail.  That means that they allow SPAM to fill up your email folder intentionally so they can sell you more space for MORE SPAM......  It is bad enough that they force you to have a MSN id to use any of their services on the Internet.  Then they allow something to happen so that you have to pay them for more abuse.   Good grief.   Now, that is customer service.....  NOT
