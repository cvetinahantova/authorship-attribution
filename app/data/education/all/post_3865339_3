The main point of this article discussed the importance of a changing vocational curriculum that allowed high school students to participate in technological classes to prepare them for the world of work. The vocational program at some high schools are beginning to include technology courses along with the traditional vocational courses, such as autoshop, construction or welding. The article discussed how changing the vocational program decreased some of the negativity that it received. The technological courses were added to the program due to the predicted increases in the field of technology and the shift of this country from "industrial" to "technological". The added courses are supported by huge computer hardware and software companies that need people with more experience in technology. The companies provide the hardware, software, training, and certification for students. Also, adding the classes to the vocational program has bridged the gap between it and academic programs because all kinds of students participate in the classes. There are issues with the program, such as company benefits and teacher quality. There is a concern about what the companies are benefiting from supporting these classes but they do not recieve any money, just well-trained people ready for the workforce.  Teacher quality is an issue because students need to receive adequate instruction on the "why" of technology, not just memorization of the skills.  I think that providing those classes for students is as important as any other vocational class.  Some students are not ready or do not want to partake of a more adademic track and need to be provided with other options.  Not to say that academics are not important, but some are just not interested and need to shown othe options that may interest them.  The additional classes also provide opportunity for true application, which is lacking in traditional academics, and training for future careers.
