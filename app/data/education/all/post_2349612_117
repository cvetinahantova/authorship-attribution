algebra got out early -- yay for last lectures of the year in both that and graph theory today... so eric and me continued the rhythm discussion for a little... eric's comment,   "you know, i just woke up this morning and realized: maybe me trying to teach other people about rhythm is kinda like other people talking to me about religion all my life... i feel the rhythm strongly, but other people, like you, just sometimes completely don't get it... other people have all this faith in religion stuff, and i just don't feel it... it's an interesting parallel."  1, 2, 3, discuss. (as for me, i think this is new discussion topic #1 for july's two-week road trip)
