I was lucky enough to have Kaf visit me today! I hadn't seen her in a year and a half, and not for a year and a half before that, when we saw each other all the time. Today I was reminded how great she is and of all the wild and crazy adventures we had together.   I was also reminded how skilled she is at Scrabble-- though I won today's game, we did have a 500-point game. I only won since I started the game with a Bingo.   Wild and crazy adventures...  -driving to Maine for the day to visit the guy we were both stalking (stopping at Phillips Exeter Acahdemy on the way) -playing Scrabble at midnight on a hot night in Providence while drinking Smoothies  -running in the rain  -playing Trivial Pursuit  -making Smoothies at the Ivy Room  -going to New York on New Year's Eve in 2000, but getting so cold after a few hours of standing on the crowded street that we decided to leave and watch the festivities on TV -the everyday conversations. I miss those the most.   Why is it that I can't remember important conversations I've had with H or H, but I can remember every word Kaf says? Why do I feel eloquent and intelligent and intellectual when I'm around her? I wish I felt those things more often.
