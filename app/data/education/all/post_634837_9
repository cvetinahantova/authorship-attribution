two individuals are sitting on separate tables, talking on their mobile phones.    theflat-hatter : phew i'm back!  sillygirlinred : as if that meant anything...  theflat-hatter : glad that you're happy to know i'm back. By the way Jason had...  sillygirlinred : well i can't help you. You jolly well know the answer already please.   theflat-hatter : yes that's pretty sad isn't it. He was so obstinate in burying old blackie by our favourite park bench. Yeah! You bet people were staring...   sillygirlinred : If you ever dare to come here, i'll... I'll just be super pissed. Don't you ever dare... Don't you ever dare! (presses the engage button)   theflat-hatter : woah... no nothing just someone at the next table. Anyway, thanks for offering to drop by later. Jason would be really appreciative. Oh wait a minute you know what! you can bring calista too! Yeah I know...    sillygirlinred is trying to read a book but she is visibly upset. She looks up from her book with the book still in her hand and is lost in her thoughts.     sillygirlinred : i wish she's here...  theflat-hatter : so it's a date. I'll see you later then and thanks dear. thank you so much.    sillygirlinred stands up and walks away.  theflat-hatter takes his hat off and looks exhausted.     theflat-hatter : i wish i was a million miles away. What's new?
