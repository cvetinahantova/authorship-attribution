Hey Baby, you rock, no worries.  It'll be better now that you quit your job.  You can finish school faster and get into an area where you really have some interest, rather than wasting more time doing something that doesn't really make your motor run. Besides, as soon as I become a high-powered and extrememly influential lawyer, I'll lend you some money for all you do-goodings.  Karen, your story was kick-assedly funny.  I laughed out loud on several occasions, because I had such a mental image of the whole three-ring circus that you were describing.  I love it!  It totally brightened up my afternoon.  Hey - I end work on Friday!  New job for the fall semester starts in 2.5 weeks - wish me luck!  P.S. - what's the deal with Phil's thing?  I don't know if I'll be able to go yet because Jon's supposed to be coming down, but who is/isn't going?  If I'm boyfriend-free, I'll probably stop by.
