Yesterday on my birthday, Kathy and I went to see  urlLink Wicked , a broadway show about the witches from Oz.  It was really great.  It's way up there in terms of broadway shows I've seen.  I wonder if I can remember all the shows I've seen.    Les Miserables - still awesome, still love it.  Wicked - really incredible, very clever, good show.  Avenue Q - also awesome.  anyone between 20 and 30 must see it.  The Lion King - really good.  The story is the same as the movie, but the sets and costumes and everything were really well done.  Freak - John Leguizamo one man show.  Good, but most of it is about sex.  Not a complaint, but an observation.  Rent - good, engaging, but not nearly as good the second time around.  The Iceman Cometh - very good, very serious, no singing.  Though we had awesome seats and got to see Kevin Spacey, Tony Danza, and Paul Giamatti.  Beauty and the Beast - pretty good.  More for the younger crowd.  Grease - the version I saw was pretty uninspired, though Dominique Dawes and Joe Piscopo lead the (ahem) all-star cast.  Cats - dumb, no story, just singing cats.  Phantom of the Opera - didn't like it, though other folks seem to.  Starlight Express - it was cool when I was 12, but seems silly in retrospect.  I'm not sure if I missed any.  I remembered two of them just as I was about to stop the first time.  I think this is a pretty comprehensive list, though.
