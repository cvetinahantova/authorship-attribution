urlLink Magical Library Lessons  This is a delightful book by Lynne Farrell Stover which contains a variety of lesson plans for 4th to 8th graders. These are very well done.  One reviewer at Amazon.com wrote:  "Magical Library Lessons by Lynne Farrell Stover (Library Media Specialist at Wilbur S. Pence Middle School, Dayton, Virginia) is a consumable workbook of 15 "stand-alone" lessons -- each of which can be taught within a 30-45 minute time frame, and are specifically designed to introduce children to the wealth of resources their school and community libraries have to offer. Sprightly language and engagingly varied themes distinguish this fun and informative instructional planner for teaching elementary through junior high students how to make effective use of a thesaurus, how to write using foreshadowing and flashbacks, how to distinguish between primary and secondary sources, and more. Magical Library Lessons is a thoroughly "kid friendly" addition to any Library Science curriculum for grades 4 to 8."
