Just when you think things can't get better, some how they do.  At least that is the case in a very small way right now.  I thought I'd found the best deal in town for the internet and as fate would have it I've found a better rate with computers and speed that are just as good.  The first place was about a dollar an hour and this one is sixty cents.  I know it's nothing to go crazy over but I'm pleasently surprized. So my visa finishes on the 22nd.  I don't have much time left here but I'm going to try and go to at least one more city and then hop back over to Thailand.  I'm going to catch a bus tomorrow (not another bus) going south.  I might visit two cities, I'm not really sure.  I've thought about heading back to Thailand from here but it just doesn't feel right.  I feel I should see a bit more before leaving.  I've had a great time here thus far and I'm curious to see what the Southern part is like, if only for a little bit.   Braves are tied for first, oh yeah. Today has been very productive and relaxing.  Got everything squared away with Gyeh-son leaving.  Bought here ticket and all that.  We went to the market where she bought postcards to give to her friends and then I couldn't resist buying more to send home.  We had a fruit shake at the best fruit shake stand in the world.  No really, this place is awesome.  For 40 cents you get a huge ass fruit shake and it's just awesome.  We got some food and then relaxed.   Things I still need to do are, I've got to buy a new book, buy a Beer Laos t-shirt, and maybe get a haircut depending on how much it costs.  Oh I have to pick my laundry up to.  It's so nice to have clean clothes.
