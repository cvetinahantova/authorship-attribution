Well by now Angela will be part way through June. I've done it, exposed my soul, my life, my thoughts, my actions. I feel totally exposed....very vulnerable!   I hope I've done the right thing. I've done it out of trust. I have total trust, total faith....total lots of things, for a person I 've known little more than a week. It not about lust, nor sex, nor a craving of affection. Its more than that....its special.   ....and now I've got to try and get to sleep - lmfao!
