No one said that to me, but they probably will in a few months since I just found out that I am pregnant.  I will be having a baby around the end of March.  This terrifies me to no end, since I will also be in school.  The timing could on ly be worse if I was 16.  I just can't get happy about this yet.  Then again I'm only a few weeks (like 3).  If anyone in my family is reading this, please keep your trap shut.  We were planning on surprising our parents closer to Christmas (since we were planning on getting pregnant in another 2 months).  I wonder if I'll be able to keep it quiet that long.  I have almost no one to tell about this.  Except you all, S, and an email group I'm in for parents with kids the same age as Shorty.
