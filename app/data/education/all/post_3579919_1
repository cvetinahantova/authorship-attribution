(but it didn't seem to work, so I'm just posting it as normal)  Well, life's been interesting the last couple of days.  I went out for Dim Sum (small delights) at a Chinese restaurant yesterday.  The menu was all in Chinese, so it was good that we had someone along who could read it and order for us.  It was really good, and I'd like to have it again.  Seemed mainly like a bunch of appetizers, but by the end, I was full.  I got a little appreciation gift from my supervisor yesterday at the Alliance Academy.  A barely used Palm M515!  I've never been able to justify buying one, but always kind of wanted one.  Now I've got one.  I spent hours yesterday evening perusing and downloading e books from an ebook  urlLink library .  They have quite a library, and now I've got my own :)   I found a demo of some nice bible software... have to decide if I'm gonna buy it or not.  Too bad my favorite free bible software,  urlLink e-Sword  is only for pocket PCs.  Oh well... such is life.  Oh, and  urlLink this  struck me funny.  We've already got plans for settlement of Mars.  I guess it shouldn't surprise me, but it did.  I think everyone dreams of being able to colonize a new planet... well, maybe not everyone... but just reading the article sent me over to the red planet, and we all watched excitedly as the latest shipment of goods came from Earth.  I wonder if there were any Mars bars this time :)
