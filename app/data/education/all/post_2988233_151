The boys jsut came running in with a baby turtle.  It is only about the size of a quarter.  Cute little thing.  So, I looked online to see what kind it is, it is a box turtle.  The boys are begging me to keep it.  I guess it is ok.  They went back out and looked for its parents or other siblings and couldn't find any signs of them, so I guess the poor little thing got lost.    His name is Sparky.  Sheesh, once its named you know it can't leave!
