today was a good day.  only one class, no homework due  after that, it was free cookie day at subway.  (no advertising, but if you're a subway regular, like... um, some people, you knew to ask and they give you a free cookie! =P)  colleen and leigh came with besides the usual me and eric subway day crew (free cookies are incentive for anything =P)  the 4 of us got some major grocery shopping done, and at the grocery store i blew 50 cents on getting a bouncy ball out of one of the toy machines on the way out... it's twice as big as a normal bouncy ball and dark green and silver and sparkly -- it's the coolest ever. =)  colleen, leigh, john, and i worked on algebra homework for an hour and a half before giving in to the beautiful weather and quitting... we got one problem done, that's something, right?  went home, got non-sandal shoes and my kickball, and alternated between kicking it around a soccer field and playing on a nearby on-campus ropes course w/ leigh, colleen, and scott... lots of fun, and a beautiful day  developed film, and camped out in the living room to watch the apprentice finale -- dude!  that was fun... i'm such an addict, i know.  then again, after it was announced that bill was the winner, i got phone calls from friends comparing reactions with me, so i'm not alone on that one =P...  i got to see the NYC news after though and see the reactions of kwame's family and an interview with the donald about it all... dude such fun.  immediately after all that, eric and me went and had a csilag buli for the first time in awhile... found saturn before it set, and jupiter and its moons were extremely bright... are learning new constellations since the ones we know set early now that it's not winter anymore  and here it is, nearly 2am, i have class in less than 8 hours, and i'm still up -- go me =P, but that basically summarizes my day =P  night y'all.
