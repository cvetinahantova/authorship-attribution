I never liked poetry when I was younger. Until I was in my twenties, I thought it was useless - people should just say what they mean. I still believe that, but out of no where, it occurred to me that poetry has it's place. Well, not exactly out of no where. Gradually, I have become aware of how much I enjoy words. Like kiddiecorner. My new friend Dustin recently reminded me of that one, and although I am unlikely to see Dustin ever again, I will call him a friend and think of him as kiddiecorner to my life. And metaphores. There is something so delicious about metaphores, I could just eat them. Sometimes, you hear something that moves you, or there is a phrase that you just can't help but repeat to yourself. That is where I started to love poetry. And I still like to collect phrases that I will roll around in my mouth, and try to use in conversation, or just let roll around in my head for a while because it somehow makes sense, despite the semanticlessness of it.   Here are some of my favorites...  "not vicious or malicious, just de-lovely and delicious"                                        -Deee-Lite,  Groove is in the Heart   "There is just no smooth or sophisticated way to do this"                                        -Robin Wright-Penn in  A Home at the                                                     End of the World   "Catching the fruits of our labor,  Holding our hearts in our hands, Waiting for you to sounds a prayer in the form of an anchor"                                        -Further Seems Forever,  How to                                          Start a Fire   "Holy sweet gawddamn!"                                        -Weezer  "Fear not, MacBeth!     No man that's born of woman shall e'er have power upon thee"                                        -Shakespeare,  MacBeth    I will share others with you when I find them. And please - PUUL-LEEEZ! - share them with me if you have some.
