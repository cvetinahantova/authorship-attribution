National Coverage  What agencies, institutions, and companies blanket the country with their products, and what ones fail? Quite a few private institutions give up the ghost in the inner mountain area.  Bank of America: I didn’t find one between Missoula and Kansas City  Sprint: Didn’t offer coverage from Missoula to Kansas City, and is not working in the Appalachians either.  Chevron: Quite scarce from Missoula to Kansas City  The New York Times: the last time we travelled across the country, I couldn’t find the Times between Walla Walla and Iowa City. But this time, we found it in small footholds almost everywhere. We didn’t get it today, but that’s because we didn’t really look. I’m sure we could have found it in Louisville. And we didn’t get it on Saturday, when we were in KC, but we could have—we got the Sunday Times there.  NPR: While the Times holes up in liberal bastions like Missoula, Jackson, or Laramie,  NPR is really almost everywhere. So you can get intelligent, liberal opinion everywhere.   CNN/Fox/Networks: Cable is everywhere, so you can also get bad reporting and inane shows. Fortunately, where there is cable, there is HBO so you can get good Sunday night television.  Espresso/Latte: Despite the idea that latte is a vice of the effete Blue States, in fact we saw drive-through espresso and latte stands everywhere. The baddest cowboys in the biggest, dustiest pick-ups seemed to be just as likely to stop there as professionals in European cars.  Safeway: Provides every kind of product you could imagine everywhere in the U.S. The most remote places we travelled had Safeways with bagels and blue berries and every other exotic delicacy.
