Well, since I'm the head of the project, I think I should put my own view regarding this :p  When Surya offered me this project, at first I thought this is an ordinary project. Collecting goods that people don't need/don't want anymore and give it to other people who are looking for the goods. More like a donation, but different target :p  But then when I looked more into it, I began to think that this is actually what we need. I mean, how many of you are thinking of giving the goods you don't need anymore before you dump it away? It sounds trivial, many of us would probably ask our friends whether they need the goods or not. But when nobody nears you want it, u'll probably toss it aside. This is where freecycle comes in. The idea is simple, it's just giving more network coverage for people to give and take the goods. Imagine how many unused goods would be 'saved' if all NUS students participate in it. Especially with people who stay in the dorm or the exchange students, they tend to throw away their goods when they moved out.  So I think this project will be a good way to start freecycling habit. When we already have the network, things will be much simpler. In the end, it's all about caring for others and caring for environment :)
