I woke up so late today coz i went out with ashden last nite and i had a late one...anyway i just came from the library loaded with books and with my cousins and bubble tea...so im just chillin  lots of my friends havent really touched their holiday homework...i've started but im stuck somewhere in each one... the only piece of work i've done and completed is biology...for chemistry i have the section a on mole concept to do...damn i hate the mole concept...a maths ive not started...e maths ive done like 3 questions...chinese, ive not finished the yellow book and the xu ci only 5 questions...jian bao hvnt done...feng shen bang read only 4 chapters...geog i havent attempted, so difficult man...and lit im stuck on chapter 7...still have 5 chapters to complete!! see so much work...and there are worse cases...  yesterday my parents were kinda worried that i went out until so late...initially i told them it was just lunch, but eventually i got home after 10 pm...so that was about 8 hours...yikes!! 2 hours on transport, so 6 hours of hanging out...i dont know, man, but my parents are really worried about me now and i think i need to be sensitive to them sometimes...but i guess ive become so cant-be-bothered-with-life-coz-it-sucks until i truly cant give 2 hoots about nothing anymore...  after a long time, here's my song for the day:  hilary duff - why not    Why Not  You act like you don't know me When you see me on the street You're makin' like I turn you off When you know you think I'm sweet  It don't have to be like that I guess you're insecure If you say what's on your mind I might answer "sure"  So I walk a little slower And try to catch your eye Sometimes, it's so hard to see The good things passin' by  There might never be a sign No flashing neon light Telling you to make your move Or when the time is right, so....  (CHORUS) Why not Take a crazy chance Why not (Why not) Do a crazy dance If you lose a moment You may lose a lot So why not Why not  You always dress in yellow When you wanna dress in gold Instead of listening to your heart You do just what you're told  You keep waiting where you are For what you'll never know Let's just get into your car And go baby go  (CHORUS)  Oh...oh I could be the one for you Oh, yeah Maybe yes,  maybe no Oh...oh It could be the thing to do What I'm sayin' is You gotta let me know  You'll never get to heaven or even to L.A. If you don't believe there's a way Why not Take a star from the sky Why not Spread your wings and fly Oh-It might take a little And it might take a lot But...why not Why not  (CHORUS)
