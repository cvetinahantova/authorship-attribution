My official training with the National AIDS Marathon Training Program does not begin until September 19, 2004. I'll be running in my pace group on Sunday mornings from that point until right before the race. I must also run for at least 30-40 minutes three times a week, in addition to the longer runs on the weekend. All of this running amounts to a serious time commitment.  However, because I have a long way to go to get in shape, I unofficially started my own running regimen on July 11. I plan to run no less than 4 days a week, beginning with slow, measured 2 mile runs and increasing my distance by about 10% a week until I can run 6 miles at a 9 min/mile pace. I'd like to accomplish this by the time the official training begins.  My goal in the Mardi Gras marathon is not just to do a run/walk finish. Instead, I'm aiming to run the entire way and finish in under 4 hours. In order to do this, I need to maintain an average pace throughout the 26 mile race of no more than 9.16 minutes per mile. This is going to be very difficult for me, to say the least.
