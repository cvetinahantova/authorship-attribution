Hey to those who might read I just want to say hello and just give some praise to God.  God has been working through me immensively throughout this past year and I just wanted to say that I am SO GRATEFUL for it. I pray that God continue molding me in a way which will best serve him for his glory. I wanted to praise him for providing me with a substitute job position that I applied to. I am really excited because I will be finally working in a setting which I will enjoy. Not to say that I hate my job....But I am finally going to be in a classroom. Yey! HOoray! Thank YOu God. I know I am only going to be a substitute for the meantime but I hope that  through the short periods I will be spending with the students, I will be able to positively motivate and encorage the students to pursue a higher education and to value their education and to know that there are many posibilities by receiving an education. I also want to motivate them to be involved in service learning and to be active members in their neighborhoods and in their society.
