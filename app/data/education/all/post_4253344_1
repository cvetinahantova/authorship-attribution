Family is like home and a place where we can seek comfort and emotional support. I believe wherever we go, when we have a clear mind, we will naturally think of our family. I love the feelings of being in a family. It is so close and sweet. It is also where we can free of mind of being careful towards one another, as we can tell each other happily of what we experience after a certain while. In this context, I am not refering to the family that we are in as in home with out parents, but when we all can still feel like a family with those whom we have no any relationships with. Currently I am studying overseas, I do feel very empty as well when there is no one dear to me around here. This is not a matter of having boyfriends or close friends around you but a matter of experincing that particular closeness where is there no competition. As the saying goes, there is no one who can be your friends or enemies forever. No matter how close you are with a particular group of friends, one day they will still leave you and may even be your worst enemy. No one can tell the future! Even among friends, you may experience certain jeolousy, competition or even gossips behind each other.
