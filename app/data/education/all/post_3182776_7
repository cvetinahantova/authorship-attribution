A small ocean fell from the sky today, but I've had worse days.   Carla broke out her sample resources again this morning, which is always inspiring. She built a whole garden in a classroom once, complete with grass, flower beds, a brick wall and a fence, about a million live plants and one stuffed fox. It's absolutely unbelievable to behold. I skipped out of the lecture full of hope and enthusiasm. If I'm one tenth as exciting a teacher as that, my kids will be pretty lucky.  My little sister has joined the blogging community. She is much smarter and wittier than me, so I plan not to read it very often for sanity's sake. I've made her a link though, so there's obviously no hard feelings.
