I phoned up the vehicle auctions today to arrange a suitable date to deliver the car to them for its VT. They said anytime I like - nice response, but has thrown me a bit as I wasn't expecting it. So I've been checking out the car magazines to try and find a replacement for between 1000 and 1500 UKP - why are all the cheap, low mileage cars in Scotland?  Also contacted my credit card company. I have been trying to transfer 300 UKP for the last 2 weeks, to close off 2 store cards. Nothing has gone through though. She tried over the phone, with no joy so I've had to move the money into a bank account to then move it to the store cards.  I will be glad when the mortgage is through and all this lot can be closed off.
