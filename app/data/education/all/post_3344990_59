On December 4th 2002 at approximately 7:30 pm the lights began to flicker and then finally went out for good.  The lights went out because of accumulated ice and freezing rain that had been coming down all day.  The power stayed out until that Friday Dec 6th around 4pm.  The article directly below this drivel was written because of this event.  :)
