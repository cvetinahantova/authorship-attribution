Got a text off Angela this afternoon, wishing she could have a hug. Well I don't need asking twice so I headed over to Leicester, seeing as MIL had put a spanner in the works (with regards to my original plan). We had a couple of hours together, went to get some car parts for one of her friends and shared a coffee while cuddling up on the sofa. We talked and laughed and kissed loads. I told her I was really happy just being there with her and wasn't at all bothered about not having sex with her, as with other people I had met, because she meant more to me than that. The next thing you know she took my hand and lead me upstairs.  The strange thing was I actually tried to stop her. I asked if she was sure (more than once) and said I didn't want her to feel used and I didn't want to spoil anything. Nothing I said would prevent her though, she "had an itch that needed scratching" as she put it.  Well I won't go into details other than to say we "made love" and I use that term rather than "had sex" because it is exactly what it was, - two people forming a bond, coming together, (excuse the pun) being as one.  It made me late home though
