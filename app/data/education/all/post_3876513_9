So, a lot of people that I know hear music in their head most of the time.  A song will get stuck in your head and you'll hum it all day long.  Or you play music where ever you happen to be sitting.  But do you hear music when you know that there isn't any music playing, and it's not the song in your head?  I do.  I'll be sitting in my living room and think that I left the radio playing in the other room, but then realize that I didn't turn it on.  Or I'll sit down at my computer and think that I can hear the CD playing really low (usually classical music), but when I turn it up, there's nothing there and when I check, it's not playing.  It's not always even music that I know.  It's just a snatch of a melody.  It's sort of like when I'm dreaming and I dream that I'm writing something or reading something.  If I wake up while doing that, the words will actually sort of make sense.  I'll competely forget what they were within the minute of actually being awake, but for that short time, I'm aware that I've been dreaming and that the words that I'm making up really do make some sort of sense.  The music that I hear, I really do think that I'm hearing, it's not just inside my head.  Of course, that's not possible, but I have no idea where it's coming from.  I'm sure it's nothing to worry about though.  Maybe someday I'll find out that my whole life, God's been playing music just out of hearing and sometimes I've been blessed enough to hear it.  That would be much more preferable than being crazy.
