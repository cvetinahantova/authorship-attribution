It's nearing four o'clock central time, which means that it's almost time for me to go to my class.  The class was the most interesting choice that I had, given that fact that it's summer and I'm studying graduate-level philosophy.  Still, I have to admit that I a bit bored with what I knew would be a boring class.  It's on Descrates'  Meditations  which are,  sans question , an extrordinarily important to the philosophical canon.  But that does not, however, make them any more interesting.  The first two times I read Descartes, I was intrigued and excited.  The second two times, I was merely forcibly intrigued.  These last eight or so times have just been overkill.  His philosophy was very innovative for its time.  In retrospect, however, it seems to rely too heavily on the purported existence of a God and on our ability to ascertain valid information through the senses (what he descrbies as "clear and distinct perception").  I would have been tons happier to have taken a class on, say, Hegel or Sartre, Nietzsche or Derrida.  But no, I was stuck learning all over again about seventeenth-century thinking.  Oh well.  It is odd, though, that so far into the present, some disciplines, I would argue most of the letters and many arts and social sciences, still look back to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with awe.  It's true that it was at this time that these still-interesting fields had their second nascent period, but they've far outgrown and indeed  matured  beyond these beginnings.  Why so much emphasis is given to them, I will never know.
