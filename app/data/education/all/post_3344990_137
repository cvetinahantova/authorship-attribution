urlLink AIDA32 - Worldwide Sysinfo Tool   I have not had much time this weekend to read the 14 blogs I am subscribed to.  During some down time this afternoon I managed to catch up on my Blog reading and ran into a VERY cool System Information Tool called Aida. Whether you are an I.T. professional such as myself or a curious end user you will find this FREE utility something to be amazed about.  I just downloaded and installed the PERSONAL EDITION on my XP Professional computer here at home and it is absolutely astounding.  I have looked at more software packages than most humans and I can tell you that this is a Winner in my book.  So, with that in mind, click on the link above and enjoy.
