I have to put in an appearence, because I love to write.  As mentioned earlier, I had a lot to do with my finals.  Man am I tired.  LOL.  Here's what I wrote for my entry:  Finals are nowhere finished.  I'm about 95% done with my final web page project, and 65% done with my Photoshop final.  Progress is good.  I also had a creative burst, so I've been a writing fool.  I hope to do more writing before the night's out, but the library's busy, so I may not.  If I take a break, I may scribble down some ideas.  I'd like to wait 'till I'm off work, so I won't be so distracted.  Bye.
