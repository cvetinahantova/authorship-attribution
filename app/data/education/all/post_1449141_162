Thoughts on Women in Afghanistan: liberation or continued oppression.  Thanks to Terry for the well researched presentation.  The story of RAWA-Revolutionary Association of Women in Afghanistan is one of courage and strength in the face of oppression from without and within.  The story is one of seeking true freedom and equality from within.  Some would have us believe that only the US can give freedom to the world.  All other places, especially in the middle east are incapable of self government, because they lack basic understanding of what democracy and freedom really mean.  RAWA demonstrates the lie.  We need to take the lesson to heart:  there are people in every country who understands what self government means.   Lets demand that our foreign policy reflect that fact.
