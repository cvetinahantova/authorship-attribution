Today was very uneventful.  I did a bunch of laundry (more than usual, thanks to my apartment issues earlier in the week), and cleaned my apartment.  The only thing I didn't get around to was running a vacuum through.  Eh.  I can take care of that tomorrow.  While I cleaned, I listened to the CD of the concert that I sang in while I was down in New Jersey.  It finally came in the mail yesterday.  The quality on the CD was better than I expected, which was nice, and it's one of the few recordings of me singing a solo that I've actually liked.    I was planning on actually cooking something good for dinner, since it has finally cooled off enough to allow for me to use the stove in my apartment.  However, when I started pulling things out for the recipe I wanted to make, I discovered that the milk in my fridge had gone bad.  That pisses me off, primarily because it was almost a full gallon of milk, and the only reason that it went bad was because my fridge stopped working on Tuesday.  Needless to say, I ended up changing my menu for the evening.  I guess I'm buying some more milk tomorrow.  :-(  The good news is, the weather today was absolutely beautiful.  It cooled off a lot from earlier in the week, and after dinner, I went out for a bike ride.  I love summer, but if the summer temperatures stayed about where they are today all summer, I would be a very happy camper.  :-)
