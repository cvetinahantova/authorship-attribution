i'm so tired...  physically,i mean. i spent half the day in school working on the annual. then daryl won't speak to me. plus, i received another threat from yang saying she'll torture me if i become a staffer again next year. i had a bad day but i didn't even think of suicide once. actually, i'm pretty okay with it. i guess i've gotten used to bad things happening to me. sure, i don't have the happiest life, what's new?  anyway, i've decided i won't talk to lyle anymore. i just get in trouble. so it bye-bye cutie. bye..i didn't even get the chance to be loved by you. whatever! i probably never get the chance anyway.  i just wanted to blog this out because this is the first i'm not complaining much.  bahala na...
