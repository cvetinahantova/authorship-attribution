I am having a lot of pressure in my abdomen today. I'm sure there's a lot of stretching going on. Last night we went to the Oliver Garden for dinner with my friend Pat and is finance' Leslie. It was fun. I could hardly eat a thing though. There seems to be no more room for my stomach. I eat like four bites and just don't want anymore. But then with out fail in a matter of an hour or so I am monsterously hungry again.  :)   It has been so hot here over the last few days. I was so happy to see it break last night. I thought I was going to just die. I was heat sensitive to being with before being pg, but it is so much hotter when you are. If there is one thing I have learned in the last few days, it is to not be really pg during the summer. I can't imagine how those ladies do it. They are stronger than me.
