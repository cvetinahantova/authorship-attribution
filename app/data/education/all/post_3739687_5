well i missed the bus to cambodia this morning.  which means i got up at 5:45 for no reason.  now i have to do it again tomorrow, but the good news is it gets back at 4:00 OR 5:00 in the afternoon so i will have plenty of time to rest for my next week of schooling.  i hope everything goes well. oh and i didn't miss the bus because i was late. i missed it because i had the wrong soi.  btw soi means street.  for example i was supposed to be at sukhumvit soi 21 but instead i was at sukhumvit soi 14.  it really pissed me off because i'm sure the woman told me 14.  anyway....  i'll be at the right spot tomorrow for sure.  i'll even be atleast 1/2 an hour early to make sure and i'm going to call the lady if anything looks suspicious.  i'd hate to  have to miss my first day of a real week of school if i have to do it on monday.  plus those nuns might go nuts on me.  well nothing else to say.  i have my camera but not my usb connector so no pics today either.  i promise to send them soon. gotta run since i have the day off i'm going to do laundry.  love ya.  jane  ps.  for some reason i can't send emails to more than 50 people so shelly will you please forward my messages on to donna, melissa, maryann, etc.  also to whoever would like them.  especially anyone thinking about coming to teach in thailand.  they might find some of what i've said useful.
