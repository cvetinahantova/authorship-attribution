urlLink Action Research in Science Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Feldman, Allan and Capobianco, Brenda.  From the ERIC Digest:  This introduction to action research in science education includes examples of how action research has been used to improve teaching and learning, as well as suggested resources for those seeking to incorporate action research into their own practice of teaching or research. Many have attempted to define action research or categorize its many variants. For example, Noffke (1997) has studied personal, professional and political purposes of action research, while McKernan (1988) has focused on the ways that ideology shapes its design. Rearick and Feldman (1999) have studied other dimensions of action research, including purpose, theoretical orientation, and type of reflection used. Here we draw upon these and other reviews to define action research as "systematic inquiry by practitioners to improve teaching and learning." Our definition assumes that the products of the inquiry are made public, adding to the knowledge bases of teaching and learning, and open to critique by peers.    ACTION RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION   Action research has been utilized in three domains of science education: teacher education and professional development; research on science learning; and curriculum development and implementation. In all cases teachers are in the role of researcher, either studying their own methods of instruction and assessment; examining the cognitive processes of learning; or participating in the process of curriculum research and development.
