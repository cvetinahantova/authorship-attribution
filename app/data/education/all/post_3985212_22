I have been asked by some (and know that most of the rest of you are wondering) "what is a Deedle Bug?".  Let me tell you a nice little story. I grew up on a little dead end road in a quaint little town in Indiana. Down the street from me were my Aunt, Uncle and Cousin. I was an only child and so was my cousin, so we were like brother and sister. But that's beside the point. :)  My whole family always called me Dee Dee (my real name is Deanna, for those of you that don't know me). So, my Uncle gave me a nickname. That nickname was none other than "Deedle Bug".  So now you know that a Deedle Bug is really a nice person named Deanna who grew up down the street from her aunt and uncle. *big grin*  Signing off......  Current Mood......silly.
