the final post from the road --  tonight i was introduced to the ohio wonder that is BW3-s, aka buffalo wild wings... quality food but talk about sensory overload... besides regular dinner time, there's a bar, a karaoke deal going on, tvs tuned to like 42 different channels around the room, and trivia (you can request a keypad or whatever to compete against other patrons... it's on still more tv screens around the room... multiple choice random factoids... it was lots of fun.  after that, alliswan, me, and her friend teresa went back to grounds for thought and played trivial pursuit for forever... only it was the 1981 release of the game so it was waaaay before our time... later teresa's husband guy met up with us all and we came back to alliswan's place and had ice cream/mudslides with her roommate lindsay, until now... 1am and time for sleep!  so yeah, it's been yet another quality visit. =)  now, two more days on the road and i'm home in jersey for a bit -- woohah =P
