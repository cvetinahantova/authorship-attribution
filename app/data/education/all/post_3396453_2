In  Masbate , in the holidays of 2001, i was afflicted by a  crush , which is a terrible thing to happen to a woman (cos it only and shud only happen to girls.. i feel that im too old for it.. oh well) Anyway, I met Mark, the object of my rampant imaginings. It kept going, going on and on. It was great at least for me. There were  rare moments  of us together. One time we were together inside a  tricycle  (how posh i know) i spent the entire time in a state of almost unbearable arousal. I  fancied  I could feel his breath on my neck and shoulder. At one point, his hand brushed my skin as if by accident. I almost came. hahahaha... just blogging!
