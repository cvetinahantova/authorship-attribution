Ah, there's good news tonight. The semesters over! Finally.  Strangely, I am relieved and disappointed at the same time.  Disappointed because I have lost two of my favorite classes. Relieved because this means no more photo assignments, no more working late after school for Desktop Publishing. So, its got its pros and cons, its ups and downs, but hey, Its all good. somehow I'll get along without my daily dose(s) of digital arts, which I really think is my forte.  My new classes are Mystery and Detective Literature, gym and Advanced computer applications.  I hate gym...and Advanced Computer Applications is well...probably gonna be too easy, but it was either that or sit around doing nothing for 45 minutes, but I decided I didn't need a study hall.    Some kid in school had a Hells Kitchen shirt.  I wonder where he got a shirt like that...I had no idea that the school cafeteria had a souvenir shop.  Hells Kitchen does sound like the perfect name for our cafeteria.  Lol  well, i g2g, so seeya.
