Yes, I'm still alive. I did nothing but research and type and type and reasearch all through spring break. Yeah, I did get to sleep in, which was freaking GREAT, but, still, that's a heckuva lot of homework.  And so, I returned to classes this week, only to be greeted with the prospect of more homework. Woo. Thankfully, I'm ahead of things again, so I should be able to get things done in a reasonable amount of time, somewhere between rehearsals and production meetings (see my other blog).  So, last night, we went to see  The Passion of the Christ , and, amazingly enough, it was Andy's idea! Wonders never cease. As far as the movie goes, its message was very powerful. For the first time ever in my entire life, the violence was so intense that it made me cry. I mean, yeah, I cry at movies, but never at violence, and this one did me in. So, if you haven't seen it yet, prepare yourself. Also, the actress playing Mary is AMAZING!  Well, off to revise rehearsal schedules.
