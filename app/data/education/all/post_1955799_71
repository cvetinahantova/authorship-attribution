People are paying me compliments on my shirt and hat today.  Makes me feel good.   I have a Superman logo on my shirt.  Guess that makes me the man.  LOL.   Somebody didn't like the fact that I got comments, and started hating, and quite frankly it turned me off.  I'm getting over that.  I should get some more cool shirts, and let them hate harder.   If I think about it what should I do anything different from today.  I need to treat myself better than before.
