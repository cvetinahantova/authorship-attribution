hey, i was having a diffcult type figuring out this blog thing.  i final figured it out thanks carol dean.  anyway, when i first read the word blog, i had no clue what it meant. i figured out what it is now  and i think it is something you could use with your class.  They can use to contact another student about some homework or just blow off some steam about a test or something.  the students could use it to ask questions about a topic, so the student wouldn't feel ashamed of the quesion, and no one would know who it was.
