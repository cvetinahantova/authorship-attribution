Went school today for the Project sanghkim meeting and got to know more about the plans for the dec project. We are going to set up a youth centre and restuarant in cambodia and tat requires alot of work and commitment. Most prob i wont be going in December but will help out whenever necessary.  My wrist hurts. Old injury from sec 3 when i broke my wrist. Guessed i have aggravated it in the last few months from my sudden involvement in outdoor activities. It hurts !!! Nevertheless, i will not give up. Will continue kayaking while i take up climbing. Me intending to buy a personal climbing harness since i am able to get it at staff price from F.I.T. Can use it for climbing and belaying during camps. Trust me , u do not want to wear the One Size Fits All harness the whole day if you do not want groin injury and abrasion.   Tomolo going kayaking again....yippee Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
