I feel it in the water; the crystal vibrations of my mother's beating heart. "Chihiro-chan" she says to me.  "Why have you forgotten us?  Why do you block us out from your mind?" In each cherry blossom I see the ghost of her sad, dark eyes coming alive with a moment of recognition.  'My daughter, my daughter," she sighs with the wind, and I turn away.  I am not hers.  I haven't been hers for so long now. I am the daughter of the Tameha-okiya now; the beloved first daughter of Gion. Kyoto holds me at night now; closely, but not too familiarly.
