It was a classic "after the storm" morning in Sheffield today. Clear still sky, droplets of water on the grass and plants and lots and lots of sun.  The air had that beautiful mixture of wet grass and flowers.  It reminded me of being at my Gran's house.  Dylan was enjoying the sunshine and rolling around making an exhibition of himself.  I've since discovered he has quite a human fanbase along our road.  The week has been pretty good.  I've found that way to deal with that anxiety thing is to stop, relax and just enjoy the scenery.  Maybe things can happen without me, maybe I'm not quite as important as I thought.  Last weekend we went to my cousin Dora and Mark's wedding in Tunbridge Wells.  A lot of may (fairly large) family were there.  It was a lot of fun to hang out with cousin's and family.  I appreciate coming from a large clan.  The wedding itself took place at  urlLink High Rocks  in an awesome old Barn.  Just over the Road were the  urlLink high rocks .  An woodland area with large sandstone cliffs - pretty impressive surroundings.  While at home my brother Francis introduced me to  urlLink Look Around You .  It's a very silly, affectionate, spoof on old school science shows - mad me laugh a lot.  Check it out.  Try the  urlLink Brain Quiz  to get you started.  Helen and I are off on a bit of an adventure this week.  We're going to New Wine first to work at the Emerging Church venue, looking forward to getting to know a few peeps there.  Then off to Snowdonia for a week of hills, rest and family.  We haven't been out of Sheffield for this long since we got married 3 years ago.    Posting will be sporadic at best.
