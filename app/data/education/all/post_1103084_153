******************* favorite word/concepts *******************  i have lots of them, but don't keep a formal list anywhere (i guess til now), but upon prompting, the following tumble of word/concepts comes jumbling out of me as a favorite discursive corner in the world...  hazy, indeterminate, indistinct, translucent.  You get it?  There, but not quite there.  Available but not assured.  so when i bumped into  urlLink this place  this morning, I decided that such a place was built for me to visit...  ...anyone up for a trek to the great mythic North?
