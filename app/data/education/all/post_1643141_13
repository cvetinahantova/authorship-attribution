Yup, that's the name of my new blog, which I hope to figure out how to integrate to this one; or vice-versa.  

 You can find it at  urlLink http://qlcrisis.blogspot.com/ .  In any case, the latest crisis, of which I don't talk about there, is got everything to do with my wireless network in my new apartment.  I just keep coming and going like a bad tide.  And talking about Tide, they have really gotten themselves (and their customers, of course) a nice fragrance, as it smells like baby blankets (clean ones, that is). 

 Okay, no more rambling.
