happy july and i'm in placencia, belize.  booyah.  i love it here.  carribean lifestyle, my friends.  the belikin beer is very good, mon. shoot, i've been doing so much traveling that i just need some time to chill on the beach and this is the place.  the vibe here is relax central. since last report, i'v traversed the longest bridge in central america twice.  in a heavy down pour.  some of my stuff is still a bit wet and smells like a combo of damp dog and sour ass, but beside that i'm in good condition.  my passport suffered a major casualty though and is feeling and looking a bit like a wet noodle. i met up with frank in rio dulce and we stayed in the weird disneyland-esque jungle cruise place that hovered on stilts over a swampy marsh. i don't know how or why i keep hooking up with american travelers, but the two frank and i are traveling with hit even closer to home, california.  damn.  i just left that place.  no, it's good times, good travel buddies.
