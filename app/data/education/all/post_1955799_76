I didn't write yesterday.  I'm such a slacker.  I know I'm writing today.  LOL.  Nonethelss the day was filled with some pretty blah moments and I had cabbage and rice on my break as food.  I'm outta cash this week, so whatever's home will have to do for me.  These weeks can be limiting, when the funds are low.  A friend gave me an apple.  I'll snack on that later.  I've also been munching on some crackers.  I can't say I'm starving, or hungry lol.  I got what I needed.  :-)   Song of the Day:   Golden Boys by Res.  Why, 'cause The lyrics are deeper than I thought, and the beat brings it on home.
