I thought you might find this application handy in the future.  I use this on a daily basis in my job as a PC Technician at Goodwill.  Check it out!  Freeware!!   urlLink Everest Home Edition Software   The product is Everest Home Edition which is free.  Download it, install it and check out all of the system information that it gives you.   :)  In the past I used an application such as Aida32 which is from the same programmer that is now writing Everest products.
