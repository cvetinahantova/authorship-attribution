CELEBRATE independance.  yeah, baby.  it's the fourth.  i'm on the island of caye caulker out in the caribean off the shore of belize.  it's pretty rockin here.  their big lobsterfest is going on this weekend.  big bob marley vibe here.  i dig it.  favorites?  banana milkshakes, the bar on the beach 'the lazy lizard' where everyone swims around with belikin beers in their hands, the snorkeling trip i'm going on tomorrow morning with frank, luuk from holland (who looks like ringo starr), and ash beavers from england.  i met the last two guys in san pedro on the the lago.  good times.  i'm running out of money.  i might end up unshaven, wearing bright-colored clothing, and selling homemade trinkets on the street.  hey, that doesn't sound half bad. i just finished reading 'mere christianity' by cs lewis. i've got to say that it was one of the most challenging and introspective books i've read in quite a while.  i wish everybody would read it RIGHT NOW so that i could talk to them about it.  peace.
