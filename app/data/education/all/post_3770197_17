After two days of not leaving the house, I finally caught Nathan at the best time to go to the movies with him yesterday and I finally got to use my VIP Patron ticket at Camera 12. We watched King Arthur which by the way was quite the clever movie. Well, honestly it was like another Troy movie. On the plus side, Keira Knightley; sexy and hot as ever. All I could think about during the movie was how she was able to keep her boobs under those 2-3 inch straps... crazy, dude. After the movie, we headed over to the booze fest at the park on First St. Reggae music filled the air (even though it was mainly the smell of weed), lots of over-legal people savouring the taste of cold Miller beer that was until we saw some people from school, then I thought, "well..um..okay."        As we were walking and talking, Nathan started laughing. I asked him what was so funny, and he told me that he just saw a guy check me out; didn't really know what to make of it except a shrug. About 10-15 minutes later, we decided to leave and take the longer exit to get to the garage because it was less crowded. Again, on the way out, he spotted another guy that was less suttle about checking out my ass: "I passed by him, and I totally saw him at the corner of my eye that he tilted his head and checked out your ass." Again, another shrug and just immediately came to the conclusion that all men that were present were just a bunch drunken hornbags and that haven't had any due to their petty egos that remain isolated and insulated in their pants. Shit, take a fucking picture, dude. It lasts longer. Better yet, go get yourself some porn, vaseline, and a tubesock. That's all you'll ever need anyways.  ...I'll apologize about that later, because right now I'm on my rag and today's my heavy flow day.
