Just finished reading N.O. Body's memoir of growing up as a girl only to discover that she was actually a boy. Her doctor misdiagnosed her sex. Apparently this happens more often than you would think. "Nora" spent her youth suffering under the limitations of growing up as a girl: she couldn't do the same things the guys could do, wasn't able to study as much, etc. She got very involved in the woman's movement. She wrote essays and lectured on women's rights throughout central Europe. Personally, her youth was troubled, though, by her discomfort with her body. She never developed breasts and didn't menstruate. She had feelings for other women, but not for men. Finally, she fell madly in love with a woman and confided her feelings in her doctor. This was of course not the same doctor who had misdiagnosed her as a child. He took a look and realized she was actually a man.   All of this is fascinating in its own right, but in the afterword by Hermann Simon, we discover that N.O. Body was a pseudonym for Karl M. Baer, who had been Martha Baer (hence the "M" in her name). She was very involved in Jewish organizations, and had actually done her work for women's rights under the auspices of Bne Briss, which is known in the States as B'nai B'rith. Most of her work was actually in combatting the trade in women. The fact that when she comes out as a man, she goes into the closet as a Jew is fascinating.  N.O. Body's book is currently available only in German: "Aus eines Mannes Maedchenjahren."
