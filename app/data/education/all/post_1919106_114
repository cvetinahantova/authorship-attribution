urlLink When things go bad    I shamelessly stole that link from  urlLink Richard's blog . So, this week has been quite weird for me. I've been awfully tired. Pretty much all the time. If I had my way I'd be sleeping all day and night. But I don't, so I can't. The closest reason I can think why I'm this tired is the large number of caffeinated drinks I consumed last weekend, and that I relapsed into caffeine dependency. Oh, well, it's not the end of the world. And I just happen to  like  sleeping, so no harm done.  Now to the good news: I did my Ontario driver's license last Thursday, so now I don't have to rely on the Texas one anymore.  Even better news is what got here in the mail yesterday. It's shiny, lovely, and I'm wearing it right now (no, it's  not  a pair of golden pants.) It's a little bit too tight, but close enough to fit most of the time (not, it's not  that  either... Pervert.) So once I get off my lazy tired ass and get to work I'll be showing it off all over the place. But first, lunch. Which is not until 2 hours from now, so I'm going to bed again.
