the easter toys r us commercial with the singing bunnies is back... i laughed uncontrolably every time i saw it last spring  one rabbit starts singing "here comes peter cotton tail..." then there's like half a dozen singing "hoppin down the bunny trail..." then the camera pans out to a whole store full of like a hundred of them "hippety hop hop hippety hop hop, easter's on its way"  i still think it's great.  yay.  half an hour til apprentice =)
