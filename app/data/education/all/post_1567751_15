"Most people I knew used God as an excuse for their failure. 'He shoud have done this', or 'Why has God done this to me?', but ... difficulties and adversities were merely occasions for doing something.   Ugliness was the chance to make beautiful. Sadness was the chance to make glad."  ~ 'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn
