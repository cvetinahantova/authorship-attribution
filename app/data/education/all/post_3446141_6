Well I have something wrong with my throat.  It started feeling funny on Sunday and Monday, it felt like I had a hair or something stuck in my throat.  Which is a very, very irritating feeling.  Anyway, I finally looked in my throat on Monday night, and it was gross.  I had little white spots on my tonsils.  I figured gargling Listerine would make them go away, because it usually does.  So I did that, then on Tuesday, I woke up and my throat still felt weird. I gargled more, and then looked at it that night before I went to bed and lo and behold I now not only had white spots on my tonsils but a gross whitish film had formed right around my uvula.  So this started to freak me out and on Wednesday morning I began looking at a lot of medical sites searching for something that looked like what I had, and it got narrowed down to Tonsillitis or Strep Throat.  So yay.  Either way I need to see a doctor.  Because if it's strep then I need to get some medication and if it's Tonsillitis then I need the same, because it's affecting my breathing and speaking abilities, which will make my next training week HELL (22 people by the way).  So anyway you may be thinking so what's the problem, just make an appointment.  Well I don't have any health insurance!  I just can't afford to pay someone else an extra $100 a month when I don't get sick that often.  So I am probably going to end up spending about twice that when I pay for the appointment and antibiotics.  Oh well.  I made the appointment for tomorrow morning at 8:15.  I actually hope that it's strep just so it will make the appointment worthwhile.....lol.  That would REALLY suck if the Dr. just told me it was an everyday sore throat and to go home and gargle salt water.  Oh well we will see.
