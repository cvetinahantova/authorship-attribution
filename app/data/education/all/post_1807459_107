Well I have a little time.  Looks like free beer might not be enough to get us to go out tonight.  I think this is good.  I'm really tired.  I'm just unmotivated to do a lot of things.  I'm not messaging people back and I'm just generally feeling a little flat.  I've partied way too much lately and I need to save my self for the upcoming vacation.  Speaking of which Tim and I went downtown today and got everything squared away.  There really has been just too much happening lately.  I can't keep the nights straight anymore.  On Friday I was out with Fenton, Tim and Min-ah.  We started at Miller Time and then went to Bellagio.  There was plenty of finger game action and titanic.  In this night I made the single best and the single worst pours of my life in the game we call titanic.  There was movie talk going on and some bets were made between Tim and I.  Turns out he was right on one and I was right on one so we split.  We had to run to PC room to go settle it.  At some point I ended up at Titanic and I might or might not have made it to BB.  I'm really too tired to know.  But I made it home safely and that's all that matters.   Saturday I really should have gone home earlier but I gave into temptation and stayed out.  It started at Outback for Andrea's B-day.  Lately the food there seems to be really good.  We then went to AU.  This is now the coolest place to drink in Daegu.  I have to say one thing that annoys me are people who are  boring and have little to no personality.  This is even more annoying if they are hot.  Anyway we moved to TC which really wasn't that bad.  Here we found Fenton who said he was going to stay in  but really lied.  I made it home late and resolved to not go to work.  There are more details to be told but I think I'll do that another time.  No spell check.
