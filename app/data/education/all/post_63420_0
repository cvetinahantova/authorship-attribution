Finally got around to doing a blog.  (Yippee !) Got motivated to doing it after seeing a policy-related blog this morning before a job interview and visiting a lot of network sites this evening:  urlLink Ryze ,  urlLink Tribe ,  urlLink Craig's List , and the other usual suspects.  I'm still too busy to research all of them out there.  One of these days I'll get to visit every site listed at  urlLink Social Software .  But by then something new will take over.....
