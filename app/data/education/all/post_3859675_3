“I like to drink out of the toilet.” This is what my nephew told me as he was joking.        Hello. I have been busy with a lot of things. Last night I spent 5 hours writing letters to folks. I didn’t notice the time go by. I just got home from a great Bible Study Fellowship at Jay’s house. God is really re-teaching me the meaning of fellowship. The importance of it is needed for our Christian lives. I learned tonight that fellowship was highly needed in the early church.     Not much is going on instead of going to Fellowship, Summer Movie Matinees, and ya, forgot to tell you, last week I saw Spiderman 2. I loved that movie. I just don’t like that they don’t go by the comics and all. It makes us, who know all about the comic storylines sad a little. But it was a nicely done movie. The best I have seen in years.
