I heard something that I feel is fucking profound. Truly inspired.  It was a study that was reported last month in the Journal of Neuroscience (very prestigious journal in the field, for those of you who don't know) about brain activity during the male sexual orgasm.  I am still looking for the article, but basically, the study used neuroimaging to show that during and following orgasm, men's amygdalas show hypoactivity, or depression of activity.  What is the amygdala, you ask?  Well, basically it is the center of emotionality in the brain.  It is where feelings are processed, and connections made between things we experience and things we feel.  Fucking profound.  When I heard this bit of news, I actually paused for about 30 secs, and in that time, all of my past (sexual) relationships came flooding back to me, and it all made sense.  It all makes so much fucking sense right now, I can't even explain it.  You need to crawl into my brain and see how everything has just lined itself up...  BTW - similar study done in the 80s showed the opposite for women: increased activity during and following orgasm.  Of course.
