Hello, Working on my creativity.  I seem to be lacking the proper focus.  I'm all energy, and I'm feeling a need to direct my energies into something positive.  I suppose I can call this a mature move on my part, because I really am desiring to have a purpose in writing I want to see a positive output of talent.  Creativity is a gift, and I want to pool my resources, because I know I can be a success with my gift.  That is someting I have always neglected.  My success depends on how I conduct myself, and if I shy away from my ideas, then I have nothing.  I'm still in the process of developing ideas proper.  I don't want to play it "safe" and try to second guess myself.  I want to take some risks, and work at my crafts.
