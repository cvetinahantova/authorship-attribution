I got home just before 21:00 and was very wound up. I couldn't settle or relax at all, but didn't want to go out running or cycling. In the end I had a bacon sandwich and watched some TV. By about 22:30 I was feeling shattered and eventually we went to bed at about 23:00.  I read for a bit and tried to get some sleep. Unfortunately, our youngest daughter came in after having had a nightmare at about 01:30. She stayed with us all night, which meant I felt uncomfortable and couldn't sleep at all. By about 4 or 5 I was considering going into her bed, but last time I did that I couldn't settle either, so I gave it a miss.  Today I am exhausted, but I am trying to keep myself busy so that I don't sit and think about this appointment later. Just typing about it, I can feel myself becoming uneasy.
