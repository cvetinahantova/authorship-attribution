G'day. This will be the place where I post my thoughts, comments, critiques on life, the universe, everything - and a banana. I'd love to hear back from ya on what's going on in my brain from time to time... that is, if anything  is  going on in there! lol

 
For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, my name is Maljam or Malster (that's my webname-nickname anyway), tho a very close friend calls me the  'Mallard'  - a wild flying duck! Whoo hoo! I'm living in the Central West of NSW Australia, divorced, 40, with three wonderful sons. I'm trying to be a full-time University student...!
