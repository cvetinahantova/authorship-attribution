Inevitably breathing space on holiday has given me a fresher perspective so my posts from the week before half term seem a little cynical.  Sorry  Agree with Andy's comments on  urlLink Moogaloo  about my  urlLink earlier post .  But once we start questioning then where do we stop?  My big question is what becomes the barometer to help us measure what we should or shouldn't accept, isn't there a danger that we only believe what we see as familiar, understandable or acceptable.    Then again Jesus promised that the Spirit would lead us into all truth so maybe I need to be a bit more trusting and allow God to lead and work.   Perhaps too though there are some safety checks.  For example community, family.  If the spirit is leading us (Christian worldwide community) then there should we shouldn't feel to uncomfortable about accepting common held opinions and beliefs.  I guess we need to be accountable in our thinking as well as the other stuff.
