urlLink Supporting Paraeducators: A Summary of Current Practices. ERIC/OSEP Digest.   This ERIC Digest examines ways that support staff in schools can be helped.  It is written by Cynthia Warger.  From the ERIC Digest:  Increasingly, paraeducators, also known as paraprofessionals, are providing instructional and learner support to students with disabilities under the supervision of licensed teachers, a major shift from 40 years ago when paraeducators had primarily clerical responsibilities. Today's paraeducators still perform routine clerical and housekeeping tasks, but now there is a greater emphasis on their instructional and learner support roles.   This digest outlines some actions that teachers and administrators serving in supervisory roles can take to ensure that paraeducators have adequate knowledge and skills for these new instructional support roles. The following practices result in improved paraeducator effectiveness:   * Assign appropriate responsibilities and tasks   * Provide ongoing, personalized support   * Offer training opportunities and resources   * Encourage high standards.
