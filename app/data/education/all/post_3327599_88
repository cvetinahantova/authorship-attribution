so today was cool. around 1 i went over to sheila's and then we went shopping. i bought some cute tops and a new skirt for my senior pics that i FINALLY made an appointment for! it's on sat. morning. anyway sheila and i finally finished around 6 and we went to see Mean Girls. it was soo funny. sad to say it was mostly true. girls are horrible creatures and overly emotional and just awful lol. i love being me tho! i'm allowed to be a bitch... but then you have to take a look at the other half of our population.. the boy.. guys are so simple. if they are mad they just confront the other person.. after a couple of grunts and a punch or 2 everyone is friends again. so how is it that we are so different when it comes to this kinda stuff? guys dont really start rumors in order to ruin each others lives. they tell the truth lol. like that rumor about Eddie hanging a kitten. i asked him about it one day and he said "yeah that.. it was my neighbors cat and it was an accident.."  Â   moving on. after the movie sheila and i sat in the drive thru line at mcdonalds for like 10 mins.. and then we went over to Phil's.. and woke him up.. lol. but it's ok he likes it. just like how he likes it when i snap his rubber bands on his wrist.. he just doesn't know he likes it..
