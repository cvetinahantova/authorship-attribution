People who see movies or the more sophisticated term, moviegoers, have a tough decision this week.  Dodgeball is definitely going to be a top comedy of the summer.  But, then there's The Terminal with Tom Hanks.  Once again, another awesome solo performance by an awesome actor.  Add this one into your collection of hits like Forrest Gump or Castaway.  So what do you do if you can't afford to see both right now?  Well... Combine the two.  I am doing what no other company is doing.  I plan to release "Dodgeball: The Terminal Story".  It begins with a dodgeball game going full throttle.  Then you meet all your favorite Dodgeball characters.  Halfway through this 2 and a half hour extravaganza, you find out they have to play the finals in the airport where Tom Hanks is.  The rest, well...you'll have to imagine that.
