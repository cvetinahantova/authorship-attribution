Jim Morris                                       2001 A fantastic movie I had ever seen before, it's really moved my mind and haunted me somewhere in my dream. Here's the website i wanna tell you: http://www.click2flicks.com/the_rookie/the_rookie_ch1.htm It's a nice website, which offers the story of Jim Morris.
