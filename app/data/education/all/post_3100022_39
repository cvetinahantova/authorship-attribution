First up, I'm impressed with the size of Rachelle's last post, not only that but I quite enjoyed reading it! I'm now not surprised as to why I got a call in the middle of the day, by a panic stricken Rachelle saying "it won't go throught!!! it won't go throught!!!" meaning that the post mechanism of my blog wasn't working, and that Rachelle though she was going to lose all her work =)   I am still working at the Walkabout   searching for "the perfect job" is long and arduous, there is so much work out there to choose from. I have found one very likely job, that I like quite a lot - but the pay is crap and I'm having to negotiate that today.  Lastnight was a depressing one for England, For after the most epic game of football I have ever seen, England lost by the smalest of chances. And forever dashed their lonely hearts against the rocks of dispair, for they will never have the opportunity to win the Euro 2004 football.
