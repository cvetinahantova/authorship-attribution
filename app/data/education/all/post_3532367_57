Well it's Saturday and I'm off to work - I've taken a part time job to help on the income front. The good news is, it pays 100 UKP, the bad news is, it's only summer work for a few months. Still its helping us get out of a "tight spot". Should be finished by lunch, then I've got to get my bike over to Worcester.  I got an apology this morning from Sandra for her comments to me last night, it helped a little, but I can't help feeling that she meant what she said. Still I am usually good at forgiving people, so it should all be in the past by the end of today.
