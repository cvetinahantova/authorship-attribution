Today I was reminded of what God's love is like. No matter what you are going through he will take time to listen, love, and care for you because that is just how he is. I was kind of grumpy today for some reason and what I needed to do was pray before I went to take care of Brynn, I did a quick prayer but that was about it. Well Brynn decided it was going to be disagree with Cela day, I should have known. But even though in the beginning it was a little hard I just had to lay myself aside for a bit and think of Brynn, she needs me to be a role model not a drill sergeant or the evil nanny, she needs to be loved and cared for. My night ended up being good, I just had to refocus on what my heart was saying. Some verses that I am reminded of tonight are: Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on a tablet of your heart. Proverbs 3:3 The Lord delights in those who fear him, who put their hope in his unfailing love. Psalm 146:11 How happy are those who know their need for God. Matthew 5:3 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourself. Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patience in affliction, faithful in prayer. Romans 12:9-12
