urlLink    Fox Hill Campgrounds, Austerlitz, NY  Got up early in the morning and hunted around for a shot and was blown away by this beauty of an accident. I thought it was going to be to dark for a shot, but the sunbeam in the center really lit up the picture.  The rich greens, yellows and reds feed off each other... does anyone see the one major distraction? (No not the tree on the right hand side)
