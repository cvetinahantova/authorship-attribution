urlLink      Well, I may as well admit it-- I'm nervous about going back to college. First of all, I'll be older than most people there, so what if that naturally keeps people away? I mean, I'll already have the stigma of being a "drama geek" attached to me, which alienates me from a lot of people, but what if the fact that I'm older and married has the same effect? Will I have to wander around alone with no friends? Will I be that girl that has to eat lunch by herself while studying because nobody wants to go near her?  Plus, what if my financial aid keeps screwing up? Will I even be able to start classes with everyone? Will it be awkward, starting halfway through the year, seeing as how most people have been together since the fall? What if I've forgotten how to study?  I'm freaked. :(
