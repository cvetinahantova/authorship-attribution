Surrounded by the great expanse of cold and empty night     The ever-moving flow still reaches in, With frigid fingers clutching at some nonexistant light-     A fruitless search for deity in sin. The breathing sky moves ocean tide and stirs the waters on,     'Til land and sea meet violent in foam; And yet I watch them flow again to darker night beyond,     Alive only to live and be alone. If only day would come at last and kiss the dying sea,     The fearful chop made calm by heaven's breath; If only sun would melt the night and make these captive free,     Then life would be victorious over death.
