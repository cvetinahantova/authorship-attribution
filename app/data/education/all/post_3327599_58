if you haven't seen the "Girls Lie Too" music video you HAVE to watch it or at least listen to the song.. it's sooo funny. (it's by Terri Clark.. she's my hero). i love that song because y'all know we lie to those silly boys all the time.. hehe.   there isn't too much to talk about right now.. i'm just really bored. i'm going to the Warren Place Tenant Party tonight.. at Discoveryland. i'm sure it'll be your typical tenant party.. i read a little about it earlier and it didn't sound too interesting.. line dancing and 2 step, with a live western band.  native american dancing, and the audience is encouraged to join in on the Friendship Dance.. and y'all know me.. i'll probably get up there lol. anyway! that part sounded crappy but the tickets were covering up the top half of the sheet and i didn't bother to move them and read it... theres gonna be a big BBQ. "Wild West Fun"? what's that exactly? calf-head ropin' rodeo roper, and a mechanical bull ride, i think i have to do that.. just to see how long i'll last. but that's the thing about dating cowboys.. 8seconds is a good ride to them.. the lesser fun stuff.. haystack treasure hunt, volleyball, jupiter jump.. lol oh and pony rides! yes! i made the list too! for some reason i'm under dessert.. "cowboy's dream".. i taste good with whip cream! haha. ok well i'll let y'all know how it was later tonight.  as an after thought.. i got my cell phone bill today.. i'm sorry to say it was only 11 pages this time.. i'm trying soo hard to break my record of 12 pages.. so close.. my month started over tuesday tho so call me!!
