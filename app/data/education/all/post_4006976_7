We are now packing frantically.  They have evacuated another street closer to us. The fire is still far from us though. I will post just before we leave if we have to go.  However, the power might go out. We have a generator but I don't know if ernie will think the computer is a priority... ;)  Ernie and I just got back from dropping off the binders and thought we'd pick up a BBQ chicken for supper - nobody's been eating much and making dinner seemed almost like an after thought. In the parking lot of the grocery store, we could feel the heat from the fire and the smoke cloud above the Mission was horrifying.  It looked like a giant storm.  A really hot wind was blowing and chunks of burning houses were landing everywhere.  We both sensed something serious.  We raced thru the grocery store grabbing the stuff we needed and raced home.  When we got there, Angie had her entire room packed into her jeep, Mom and Rod were almost packed (from our place) and ready to go, and we were in the midst of packing up our stuff into the motorhome, pickup, and minivan.  It's been such a freaky day. All you can hear are sirens and airplanes and helicopters. It feels like war.
