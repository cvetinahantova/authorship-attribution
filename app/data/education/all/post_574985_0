Ray Majoran of  urlLink electricurrent  and  urlLink ChristSites.com  wants church webmasters to think more deeply about their online communications strategy. In a  urlLink call to action "field manual"  for online churches, Majoran lists seven questions to "challenge your thinking about how your church media can be effective in today's world." A more thorough version of this call to action is available  urlLink in PDF format . It's also a bit of a sales pitch for  urlLink electricurrent , but it serves as a good public service announcement to the online Christian community as well.  Having said that, however, I still think Majoran falls short in his assessment of developing excellence in church media. He doesn't go beyond the traditional thinking of many online Christian ministries. Majoran talks about developing excellence in web design and web communication, but this all still assumes that people will be  looking for  church websites. From an outreach perspective, this is the traditional, "build it and they will come" passive approach. I wish Majoran would read my two-year-old piece on  urlLink The Church-Internet (Dis)connection  for a different perspective -- the idea of going out into the world of cyberspace instead of expecting the world of cyberspace to come to us.
