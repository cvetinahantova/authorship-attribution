What??????  urlLink LOCUSTS Aren't they just adorable.  Between the song they sing,a nd the crunching under the feet, what a joyous summer this will be.  No barfoot walks in the evening this summer.  Nope, go barefoot and all you will do is feel their shells crunching under your feet.    I saw the first one of the season today, it was on my tulips.  MY TULIPS.   Now if you know me well, then you know that you don't mess with me and tulips, they are my absolute favorite flower.  I have had a hard time with my tulips, this is the second year in a row they have grown up but now bloomed.  And now, they have cicadas.
