I hate when technology overcomes me! It's the fucking third time I'm writing this blog. I need to be tech smart! Well, the blog's topic was the continuation of my last one. I wrote about the positive influences I had that help me endure tough times. This 2 forces were Mirta and Marta. Mirta was my nanny in my early childhood until I was 11. She was my friend Mirta's grandma. She was there for me, and took my side when she thought I was right. My mom never heard her, and punished me for things my brother did. My buddy Mirta told when I saw her recently in Argentina, that I was always grounded... I was grounded for stuff Ro had done, but my mom always preferred him over me. My mother and brother went out to have fun while I stayed home punished with Mirta. I kind of liked the peace at the house, but   as time went by I grew apart from my mother. It's hard to have feelings today, even if my mother is trying to do the right thing, because she did not plant the necessary seeds or water the plant correctly when it was necessary. It is hard to show affection, when we never did...    Marta was another positive force in my adolescence. She was my nanny from 12 on. She has always been like a big sister. She took my side a lot, since mymom went crazy during my teenage years. We fought at times, but minutes later we were having "Mate" and laughing. I learned to cook by watching her, although I took a couple classes with famous chefs from 1992 to 1994. Marta was there when I needed guidance, and gave me advice when I was loosing it. She adopted Carlitos when he was 2. I used to take him to places, and when I saw him recently I could not believe how big he's got! He's 16! My mom always thought that Marta was partial to me, so she never listened when there was any issue w/ Rodrigo. At least someone that favored me! My mom slapped me in the face when "I went out of control." With time, I started to laugh, no matter how much I was hurting. She stopped.
