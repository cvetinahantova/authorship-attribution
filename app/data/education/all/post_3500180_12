Wow... the science exam has left me speechless... I spent a long time studying things that turned out NOT to be on the exam. My precious time was wasted on studying useless stuff....>_  On to the next subject! Geography... Good thing about geography is that most of the stuff is still fresh in my mind, 'cuz I have semestered geo. I should be studying now, but I'm not. Why you ask? Because I am a lazy lazy bum, that's why.. >_> Procrastination is my downfall.  Maybe I should go review geo... and then it will turn out that I memorized all the useless stuff again, and then I will shoot myself because life is not fair... okay, enough rants for now....
