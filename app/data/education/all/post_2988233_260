I jsut talked to Renee, nad Savannah is doing really good. So far all of her tests are good, and she has handled them really well.    One problem, she is homesick.  this is the first time she has gotten homesick on a trip to Chapel Hill.  She told her mom she wants to go to bed with Daddy and go to mamaw's house.  How precious.    She also told her mamaw on the phone to go say hey to the cows for her.  Every day, she gets somebody to take her down the road to see the cows in the neighbor's pasture.  So, she told mamaw to tell the cows hey.    They are doing good though, a couple more tests tomorrow, they will be home late tomorrow night.  Pray for safe travel for them.
