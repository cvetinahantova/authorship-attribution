hahaha...mid year exam..my results went down..a very GOOD challenge for me to boost up my performance after this especially in the trials..   last night.. there was a session between the form 5 students and my sch's ex students.. wow..dunno i got some cool ex-students.. one of them was an engineer.. just three years came back to malaysia.. he's noow 35.. just imagine how long he's overseas.. he circled the world three times and there's only two countries he haven't been to yet..that is new zealand and nepal.. he's really cool and really enjoys his life to the max! though has a degree in engineering, now he works as a restaurant manager.. been chosen as the best restaurant manager for pizza hut in malaysia last year.. yeah.. he's really cool..  life has been always fine.. a little bit more happier.. yalah..must be happy what got another gf.. what the heck?! huh..dunno.. but the truth is i can't deny my feelings anymore.. 5 years suffering.. thank god i still survive.. after everything has been spoken.. i couldn't take it anymore.. this love must go on.. though i have someone.. but i'm only a human.. human always change.. maybe it is hard for me to do it and this is not bullshit.. hurting someone is the most cruel thing to do.. but what can i do? my heart has change.. i've had a crush with this new girl yers before i met my present gf and now as both have already known that the both of us have the same feelings with each other what can we do? have to carry on and don't lie our feelings again.. a love is not a love unless it is spoken and now is has already been spoken what are we waiting for?? no way i'm gonna leave this chance of a lifetime to be with someone that i really wanted and it worth a try
