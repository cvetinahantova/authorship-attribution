Today went extremely well. I had the opportunity to see some people coming into my class with bad attitudes and walk out feeling like this might be an interesting semester and that they were capable of success. I only did one really stupid thing. I misplaced my syllabus for the 12 TP class. I knew that I had it, but when it came time to hand it out, it was gone. Turned out it was about 6" left of where I thought it should be and somehow just couldn't find it. I have no idea why stuff like that hppens to me.  I really want to make this semester as good of one as is possible, but of course they can only get out of what what they put in. Here's hoping they put forth an effort.  My kids all seemed to have good days at school today. Catherine complained that her social studies teacher is mean, but she apparently is hapy with the others.
