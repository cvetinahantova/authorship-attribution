Whatever Happened to Pong?   Let's face it: the 80s are not worthy of any sort of revival.  And with the recent mining of  urlLink pop culture's last unironic mineral , its futile to argue otherwise.  Punk died, movies started to suck again, and people  urlLink dressed like assholes . Ten years of cultural landfill.  (Will Generation X  go down the same path of self-nostalgia as their parents and burden us with the 80s for another fifty years?  I hope not.  These jerks won't be happy until everything's a joke and nothing but duct tape and heroin have any legitimate significance.)   On the other hand,  urlLink the video games rocked like they haven't quite rocked since  (Via  urlLink The Presurfer ).  Somewhere along the way, we lost sight of the fact that a video game is supposed to test the body's physical memory and ability to overcome sweaty thumbs under pressure.
