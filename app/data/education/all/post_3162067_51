I am, as ever, exhausted. This time, my neck is really aching as I've been at the compuper for many hours doing schoolwork type stuff in preparation for my last week. I'm gonna be doing so much marking for my holidays! Went home last night for Anna's hen-night. It was so much fun, dressing up and going out with the girls. We went for a chinese and a drink, then everyone else went out clubbing except me, as my back was killing me! It's still killing me, but at least I can lie down in a minute. It's horrible being in pain when you're at home. I've just written up a help-sheet with regards to my tutor group, to give to the teacher who's taking over from me. It makes me feel so sad to go over all the names. Or at least it did. Now I'm tired and achey and I want to go to sleep, which means I'm very glad not to be working as a teacher soon.
