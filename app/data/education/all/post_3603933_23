Another perk to my new job - free horse lessons!  Since the family I work for owns a  urlLink horse stable  and a lot of horses I can ride whenever I want to.  Not that I have ever really ridden before.  I think I have been on a horse twice before.  Once when I was really young, so young that I can't quite remember it.  The other time was when I was a junior in high school and my famiy took a vacation in southern Ohio.  All I remember about that was that my dad rode a horse named Flash and that was hilarious.  Flash: the slowest and most rebellious horse you can imagine.   Today after I finished working in the classroom I went out to the  urlLink stable  with Annaliese (one of the girls in the family) and we went to the pasture to pick out Star, a beautiful (though slightly fat) horse.  I have never been so close to so many large animals without a fence.  We just walked right into the pasture and about five large horses came right up to us - I got to pet them!    Annaliese then took me to the indoor arena and she taught me how to sit on the horse correctly first.  Then I learned how to trot and how to move with the horse so that while trotting it didn't feel bouncy.  I never really saw myself liking something like this but it was very cool.    I am going to keep taking lessons I think.
