This week is flying by me so quickly. I don't know where time goes.  Today was rather good although yesterday burnt me out and made me realize what a cat and mouse game that high school is. I shall not frown on that though, just do my own thing and straight kick it like I always do. I finally realized that I am growing up and am slowly but surely leaving my teenage years and kind of look forward to it a lot more than it scares me. I finally have my Eagle Scout (although it isn't 100 percent complete) and I have relearned that there are other things to life besides girls and school (which are both very nice things. teehee!), and am trying to focus my energy on things better and more helpful to myself and to the world as a whole. I got to play this game where you shoot people at school today! Our schools lil block thing didn't block it! Kinda sad but it was fun until I kept dying. I am now officially addicted to Tron now, so I might be a Tron nerd, but ah well! Love ya guys!  (Yes I know I'm probably a boring person!) Love you all! Take care.
