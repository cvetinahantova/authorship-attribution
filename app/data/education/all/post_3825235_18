So, today was the first day of my new schedule at work, and it was great!  Even though I did have to hit my snooze button this morning, I was glad to have gotten up early and not slept the morning away.  (I have been sleeping until 8:30 or so, and by the time I would eat breakfast, and get myself and Abbie ready for the day, it would be practically lunchtime.  Now I will be AT work at 7, so that will be nice.)  My morning was so nice...and if you've been reading  urlLink my sister's blog  (or even know me iRL), you know I am a person who dances in my car.  Hardcore.  This morning I was jamming out, and I realized I hadn't done it in a LONG time.  You know the kind where you don't care who is staring open mouthed...not even enough to tell them to take a picture because it lasts longer.  I couldn't remember when I had last gotten lost in my music like that, so it had to be before last semester got hectic and stressful.  FOREVER AGO!  (Oh, and just in case you're wondering (and I know you are!!!), it was to Lifehouse, Hanging by a Moment.)  So, I am now home from work.  I got out early and went to lunch with my Uncle and his new wife, but I'm so ready to wake Abbie up so we can get outside and wash the car.  Sadly, I think I will just let her sleep and wait to wash the car.  (It's kinda like, "Can Abbie come out and play??"  :))  *Well, I actually write this post at 2:30 or so, but it published twice, so, to make a long story short, I had to delete both entries and could not delete just one.
