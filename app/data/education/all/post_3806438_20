If the purpose of a marriage is create a family, then old people shouldn't be allowed to get married, and people who can't have babies shouldn't be allowed to get married.  Since these people are allowed to get married, then clearly the purpose of marriage is something other than creating families.  That being said, gay couples should be allowed to get married because, as best I can tell, marriage is simply an expression that you love that person enough to commit to him or her forever.  Or at least until the divorce is final.  Also something that doesn't fly is the argument that gay couples would ruin the institution of marriage.  If J-Lo, Elzabeth Taylor, Larry King, and the other 52% of married people who've gotten divorced haven't alreay ruined said institution, then it simply cannot be ruined.
