I dont like...to regret in life. It seems to be one of the worser emotions in life. While it's acceptable to understand and to act on times when things have gone wrong.

I tend to not regret, while I can look back at 8 months of fancing, and dare I say loving Tom, I do not regret.

I tend to not regret loving carelessly, while it hurts, I feel as if it is a duty or perhaps an uncontrollable habit that I suck myself into.
