Recently I have been biking with either my former roomies or my father.  When I started back using my own bike I noticed two things.  One, the permit on the bike expired Dec. 31, 1994 and two - my Schwinn Sidewinder bike has a little symbol that looks like a sperm.  No it really looks like a sperm!  Anyone who wants to see I'll show you, its funky!
