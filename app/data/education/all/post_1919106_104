And the week ends   Crazy stuff, school here. I am settled in one class -  Social Implications of Computing  is a keeper. But the other one... I dropped  Intro to AI  because it had  Algorithms  as a prerequisite. Now I'm taking  Software Architecture . The one good thing about it is that it's only one day a week. Oh, and I'm submitting a paper to the Graduate Research Conference. First prize is a PDA, worth $500. Sweet deal, for just a 10 minute presentation.  I went back to visit my parents for the weekend. Mom wants me to set up one of the laptops in the kitchen, so that she can e-mail from there, because she doesn't like the basement, which is where her computer currently is. Probably the best thing is to get her a WAP and a WiFi card, that way she can use it wherever she wants to - even in the garden, during the summer.  The weather has been really cold here this year - even Waterloo residents are having problems. I'd be fine with it, if only the wind wasn't blowing. Even a 5 mph wind can seriously hurt you at these temperatures.  Finally, last night I had a pretty long discussion with certain people about... Umm... Some things. Which are getting complicated. I really don't know what to do at this point. I just hope that I don't mess this one up.
