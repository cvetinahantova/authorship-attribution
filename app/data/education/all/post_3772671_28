This might seem like a dull entry, but this story in the  New York Times  about the ways in which the railroad companies try to wriggle out of responsibility for deaths at railroad crossings is a brilliant piece of muckraking. It begins with an account about a death here in Eastern Washington. After the death, someone from the railroad company snuck in and secretly replaced a defective piece of equipment. Only when an attentive trial lawyer noticed that the serial numbers on the equipment didn't match up with the reports was the fraud uncovered. It makes your blood boil. Go trail lawyers!   urlLink The New York Times > National > A Crossing Crash Unreported and a Family Broken by Grief
