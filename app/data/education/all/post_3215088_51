It is not the quantity of a blog that counts, it is the quality....  so i shall present a good piece of blog today after so many boring days.  Went Big Splash today with kaixiang and celin....they sun tan and call me go....as if i not dark enough siah....in the end i kayak there while they absord the vitamin D. Not bad work out today cos i managed to do my first ever hands-roll on a kayak. Went for dinner at east coast hawker center and we order a hell lot of food. Too full that i had to take an antacid pill for indigestion. Celin's van could not be started after the meal. I tried trouble shooting it ....i actually guessed the correct "general problem" that the circuits or connection is loose. Just that i am not familiar with cars ( me tank mechanic mah) , cannot pinpoint exactly where the problem is... in the end got to trouble her dad and mum down. Celin's dad just tighthen something near the engine and viola!! The vehicle just started.   Went to coffee bean and have a drink next. As usual a talk cock session with all sorts of rubbish.   Got a call from the camp coordinator that he need me to take over as group instructor for tomolo's camp. So now i upgraded from 1/2 x 2 day camp activity instructor to 3D2N group instructor. More work = More PAY = hopefully MORE FUN.   Going MIA for the next 2 days liao ...cheerios  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
