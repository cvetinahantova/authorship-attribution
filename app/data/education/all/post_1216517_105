Trev, Jayna, and Me on my trip to Washington.  I hope that guy moves down to California soon. I miss him. He is a good friend. We've had many good times together. Friends are good.

This is my wife  urlLink Katie . Our 1 year aniversary is coming up in October. We're going to the Cinque Terre in Italy.      This is me after I fell in a hole
