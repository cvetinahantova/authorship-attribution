Always interesting to see what has and hasn't been nominated for the  urlLink Mercury Music Prize 2003  and also fun checking out some of the more obscure nominations.  Not too bad a list this year.  Good to see that Lemon Jelly are there, thats one of my favourites from the last year and its nice that Athlete are doing well.  Blur's absence is not surprising considering the Gorrilaz thing in 2001 but where are Massive Attack!?!  Its surely as good as the Radiohead Album.  In my opinion Manitoba should be there too, but not sure many people would agree with me there.
