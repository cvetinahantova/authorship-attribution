What colour is Prince?  Is he:   a)Black b)White, but tanned c)Asian d)Mixed race e)Purple  It's not a trick question. I'm just curious.  For the last few days my life has been a particularly miserable, murky shade of browny-grey. The sort of thing that Turner might have used  in one of his more unpleasant-looking storms, but nothing that you'd really want to paint on the living room wall, if you know what I mean.   Today a whole gaggle of family and friends and generally lovely people injected some much needed sunshine. I thank you. Now everything will probably be okay.  I love you all.  x.
