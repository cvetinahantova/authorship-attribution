I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IT'S OVER!!!!!!!!!!!! My piano exam, anyway! Yes, that is, grade 6 piano and i'm sure that i at least passed! In fact, i even did better than i normally do in exams; i was hardly shaking at all!  I'm listening to Boxcar Racer it's so cool!  The day is so beautiful, i'm so happy, wish me luck tomorrow for the public speaking competition but i'm sure i'll enjoy it when i'm there (even though now i'm with Jonathan Temple ... no grace that's not funny!)  dee dee da la la la dum doo la la dum da dum dee dee dum doo daa (BCR song, obviously; Letters to God)  luv u 4 reading this whoever u r, i'm so happy and there is absolutely no reason for it! Ha ha! xxxxxxxxxx Greenie
