Fahrenheit 9/11,  urlLink Michael Moore's  new film surpassed the $100 million mark over the weekend, the first 'documentary' ever to do so.  I guess that's a good thing, since people are going to see it and maybe he's making some people think.   I would bet, though, that  a lot of people who've seen the movie already agree with him, and are just looking for more reasons to dislike Bush.  Maybe some open-minded folks are going to see it without having preconceived hatred for Bush, and that's an interesting notion.   The thing is, Michael Moore stretches the truth way farther than it should be stretched.  Here's  urlLink one example  of some misrepresentations in the movie. Here's  urlLink another one .   Moore makes it look like the only way you can make these arguments is by lying, which isn't true.  One can easily make arguments against George Bush and his administration without stretching the truth, yet Moore chooses not to.  He's got a history of this, too.  There are many examples of Moore taking liberties with the facts in  urlLink Bowling for Columbine , as well.  When he does shit like this, it makes the people who agree with him look stupid.  I don't like looking stupid, and that's why Moore makes me nervous.  Moore is a talented enough film-maker to make these movies, represent his point of view, and NOT stretch the truth, and I don't know why he chooses not to.   This movie was commendable because, for the most part, he doesn't resort to the silly gimmicks, like trying to interview the CEO of GM, or ambushing Charlton Heston.  There is the small section where he tries to enlist congressmen's children, but it's small, and we can put it to the side.
