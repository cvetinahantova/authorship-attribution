The Australian journalist who reported that witnesses saw Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi shoot six prisoners  urlLink backs up  his story.   He said:   "In these two cases, these two men sat before me. They spoke reluctantly, they spoke carefully and considerately.  "When I tested parts of their story they didn't suddenly provide information where none was available.  "They seem to me to be telling what they had seen, they were believable too.  "I had an independent set of Iraqi eyes and ears (of an interpreter) listening and watching on these interviews and that person, whom I have worked with for some time and who I trust, he found the stories believable."   Also, former British foreign secretary Robin Cook has  urlLink urged  the International Committee of the Red Cross to investigate.
