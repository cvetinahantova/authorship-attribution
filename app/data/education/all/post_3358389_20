hmm.. set off at bout 3+.. reach Genting just.. slept the whole way here.. haha... no choice.. cause i get car sick easily.. :s  sian.. reach here liao, was very happy.. but all spoilt by an argument about a rude waitress..  In my dad's view, the waitress was damn rude and the manager got involved..  In my view, she was just doing her job.. just a little.. rude.. but not that bad that the manager has to be involved..   Anyway, i just find it very selfish/stingy/self-centred to actually make things hard for others just becoz you dun feel good about sth and want to make youself feel good, by making others feel bad, EG: get the waitress into trouble?  i just find it selfish.. i hate it..
