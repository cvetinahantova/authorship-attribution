im Going through a troublesome point in my life. gone are the days when i can get away with anything. at this point im expected to be responsible for my actions. this isnt always a problem as new responsibility brings its perks. in this case some well needed respect from my elders. where the problem lies is that we are seen as adults by our adult peers. the problem is we are clearly not and we are still with held by the rules of childhood. why is it that we are expected to be like adults yet we are treated like children. life is strange
