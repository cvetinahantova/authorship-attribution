Hello all. I’ve been digging around in my mind for memories of my Dad, and to me he is still very much alive and present. I’ve always felt like a chunk off the old block, so I guess I’ll always feel his presence. When I think about him, I think of him laughing, making jokes, playing jokes on people, teaching me things, and reassuring me. I think about how he would take on a challenge and own it, like learning to speak Japanese or building furniture. I think about what a comfort it was to have two parents who got along so well, and always made me feel I had a safe environment to prosper in. I think about the encouragement he gave me all of my life, which blew my head way out of proportion probably. He would always tell me I had “the world by the tail on a downhill run.” Dad was never one to sit back and relax for too long. He was always busy, busy, busy living. He would instant message me and be gone before I often had a chance to say hello and goodbye. There is so much I admire about my dad that I could write, but I am sure this website publisher would inform me I was out of space before I finished. I guess I am one of the luckiest people in the world, because I had him for a father. I guess the thing I miss the most is being able to go to him with questions. I guess I have to find the answers myself now, so I can answer the questions for Abby. I hope I can do as good a job. Thanks to everyone who is posting. I love the stories.
