I didn't write yesterday.  I was real lazy.  So lazy that I didn't do much of anything constructive.  I am fustrated still that the hours for Fall semseter's classes are late in the evening.  I'm at the mercy of somebody playing with the admin system.  LOL.  I'm very pissed.    This is a skimpy post, and I don't feel muck like writing anything, but I musn't miss two days, 'cause that's when it becomes three, four and five days.  Such a sad cycle of nothiness.  I did want to work on a writing project, and may do so later in the evening.     Song of the Day:   I did have  something  to write about today.   "The Beautiful Ones" by Prince.  Why, cause it's on heavy rotation on my iTunes, and old school Prince is great Prince.
