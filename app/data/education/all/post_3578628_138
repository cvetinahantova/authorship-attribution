i am really glad that people are veggie-tarians i mean i would never be able to do it but i give them props... i love OUTKAST! like i dont know what it is but they bring an edge to music... most of the times the music out at the same time always sounds the same and they dont care and put something out completely different... its so0o0o refreshing.
