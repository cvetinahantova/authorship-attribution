I'm washing laundry.  It's a necessity.  I should not have put it off so much so much.  So it's everything from light clothes to the darks.  I didn't realize I had so much socks.  They nearly took up a whole full load.  LOL.     Classes start tomorrow.  I said I'm getting an "A" in both of them.  What can I say, I know I can keep things together enough to pass my c;lasses.  I want back on that Dean's list also.  The classes are Computer Imagery (Adobe Illustrator), and Multimedia Presentations (Powerpoint).  I'm going to enjoy both of them.  :-)  I'm not cooking today.  I'm going ton relax as much as possible.
