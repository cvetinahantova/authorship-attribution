Well it has come down from upon high that I will be spending my summer student teaching at Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills!! I'm going to be working with 7th graders who failed history the first time around! Oh joy what fun!  And from what I understand the course will focus on the Explorers, and Native American cultures (Aztec, Myan, ect).  So now that that is taken care of.  I have to meet my master teacher on Monday to go over the logistics of the course and get a copy of the text book. I'm a bit nervous.  It's been for ever since I was in Junior High, or Middle School as it's called now.  And I don't remember the seventh grade all that much.  Nor, unfortunatly, have I had much experiance with Middle School aged kids, just brief encounters while working summer camp and that was a hundered years ago.  Other than that there is not much to report. My father came home last night for a few minutes and I really wish he wouldn't.  My life is just so much easier when he's not here and when he's not in my life all that much. I know I shouldn't say such things, but it's true. I just don't get him and I don't get why he has to make things so much more difficult.
