Home again, home again. I still wish they would have told me we were leaving, because now I've got homework to do...  Anyway, my cousin graduated, and so did my uncle... that was interesting, of course. Then, we basically lazed around the rest of the time, doing whatever during the day, and watching kung fu movies by night. I've got two awesome movies added to my list, now... I managed to get my parents to let me go to Hastings, so I got the Beatles One album, and my dad got a Buffalo Sprinfield cd... that made the trip home more enjoyable.  Anyway, off to that homework I spoke of. I'll update later.  Current Music: The Beatles - She Loves You
