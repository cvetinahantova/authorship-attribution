Well, today was a much more productive day than yesterday.  And actually, my apartment looks pretty damn good!  It's finally in order.  Everything is where I want it, and all of my organizational systems, as strange as they may seem to others, are set to my perfection.  The only thing I'm not sure about is that I still have some chairs that go with my table that I don't know where to put.  Right now, they're just kind of stacked against a wall in my living room.  I don't really need them right now, but I don't really have much space in the way of storage, so I'm not sure what to do with them.  Eh.  I'll figure it out eventually.  Now I'm looking forward to a good week of relaxing, visiting, and doing a little sight-seeing.  :-D
