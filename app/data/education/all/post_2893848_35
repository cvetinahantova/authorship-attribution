When the news of Reagan's passing came, I was reminded of his re-election bid in 1984 when my parents took me and my brother to see him speak at a rally at our town hall in (mostly Republican) Fairfield, Connecticut. I was nine or ten, and boy, was I excited.   My brother and I waved our flags and cheered "Four more Years!" We jeered the Mondale supporters and liked the Republicans with the "Fritz Busters" signs (Mondale's face fashioned into the Ghostbusters logo). We made our parents rush us down the street afterward so we could wave to his limo as it passed.   Why this outpouring of GOP enthusiasm from two tykes such as ourselves, raised on PBS and whole wheat bread? Well, he was the PRESIDENT!! What did we care if he was funding the slaughter of villagers in Guatemala? Nuclear proliferation? What's that? Iran-Contra huh? He liked Jellybeans and we wished our grandpa was more like him. We didn't care what our parents thought about him -- we didn't even know! (I have since learned that my father voted for him both times, something I like to give him shit about when he spews venom over George W. and sends checks to Kerry.)  What is my point? Oh, I don't know. I guess just this: if you see cute little kids on TV in the next few months' campaign coverage, cheering for Shrub, don't judge them too harshly or take them too seriously. They may turn out to be card-carrying, bleeding heart, pinko liberals like me. As for the kids cheering for Kerry -- well, let's hope they turn out that way too.
