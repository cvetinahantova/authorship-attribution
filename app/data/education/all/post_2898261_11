Words written down for all to see, Emotion love and fantasy, Intense deep open to all, A life lines to some for others a fall.  All aspects of life good and the bad, We write down our words happy or sad, Unspoken truths easy to write, To share with others who live far from sight.  Pen to paper or tips to the keys, Words keep on flowing some times with ease, Expression to rhythm the heart over flows, As feelings for writing just grows and grows.  Then comes the moment the words they dry up, Frustrating debating the brains empty cup, Advice for the writer to give it a rest, It will all come back I promise its best.
