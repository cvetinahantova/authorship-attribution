Wednesday of this week, my wife Elizabeth and I found out that we will soon become parents! Soon, if March is soon for you.   Funny because my wife has always been the one saying "I want to have babies", while making cutesy hands, but since the news has come, really doesn't act all that excited, but nausea can do that to you. Really, the depth of the revelation has not fully hit us yet, but we are very happy.   One of the main purposes of this Blog will be to document the belly growth visually as the next 6 1/2 months pass. Oh, and I guess I will put up some photos when the little one appears.     Also in other news...           I am leaving work soon  (don't worry, I've earned this break)  to head down to Noblesville near Indy to see Sting! This will be my 3rd time seeing him live, and a delayed birthday present to myself. I'll be meeting Jenn Swift and a friend of hers. I'll give an update on this event next posting.
