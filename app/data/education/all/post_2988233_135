The whole AI thing and the thing with Eric,and just life in general has me in one huge ball of walking, talking emotions.    I could scream, cry, and fight all at one time.    I stayed with mom tonight while Tommy took Daddy to the hospital to see Eric and pray for him.  I went out on their front deck,a nd just looked at the sky, the trees gently blowing in the wind, and  started talking to God.  I don't jsut talk to him very often.  Most of the time these days, I pray my nightly prayers and that is it.    But there on that deck, darkness all around me, I jsut felt so much closer to him, like I had his ear, his undivided attention,that no one else on earth was talking to him right then, it was just me and God.  I like that feeling.   THen, Will came creeping around the corner trying to scare me, Casey came from the other corner, and Noah came running out the door towards me all of them screaming AAAAHHHHHH like monsters.    so much for peace.    I did tell my mom that if I had a porch or deck like that, I would get up every morning, go sit on my porch and read my bible, talk to God and just enjoy being there.
