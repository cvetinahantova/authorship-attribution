Oh yeah I was right, I got the boot.  But it's cool.  Things ended up really well.  I saw her last night to get the downlow and say good-bye.  Apparently she figured out I wasn't in for the long hall, not that I ever pretended to be, and decided it best to call it.  I think there are no casual fun relationships with Korean girls.  You're either gonna get married or not.  Anyway what should have been just coffee turned out to be coffee, more roasted pork, lots of soju and then a singing room.  How the hell did that happen.  I think I got home at a little before 6.  I'm a little beat.  I was going to head downtown and shop today but forget that.  I think I'll go after work if I have the energy.   While I was downtown yesterday I went to X-Milano to have a look around.  Seriously I found nothing that looked even remotely appealing.  Not only do Koreans wear this shit but they pay for it first.  I just can't explain how ugly these clothes were.  I've started paying close attention to what people are wearing to, is it just me or can they not dress?  Now I know there are cultural differences so I'm curious as to what they think of the way we(foreigners) dress.  Do they think we're a bunch of goobers.  This I think particularly the sweaters have bothered me this season.  There are some really hideous ones out there.   Becky I'd like to wish you a fond farewell.  I'll always remember you sprawled out all of the taxi the first time we met.  So I'll explain now that the reason we met on Tuesday night was to say good-bye to her.  Let me know how your trip goes. Time to teach those little Korean kids some English, or something like that at least.
