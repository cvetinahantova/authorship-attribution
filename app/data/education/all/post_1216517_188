WELCOME TO HIPPIELAND! hola amigos!  i am now in san pedro, a small town on lago atitlan.  freaking a!  this place is so beautiful.  ive found the big chill, that vibe i got in europe and in baja.  this town is on a beautiful lake surrounded by green hills and 3 volcanos.  san pedro is filled with hippies too.  it like a time machine back to the sixties or maybe just a bizarre disneyland-esque hippieland/mayan villageland.  i love it. as you know traveling is about the people you meet, i hooked up with a crew of 3 americans.  yeah, crazy.  that wasn�t a typo.  americans.  the lot of us hardly travel.  i always met brits, irish, aussies, germans, but never too many americans.  i decided i would hang out with them despite their handicap.  oh yeah, im american too.  damn it.  anyways, it�s good times here in guate.   ive discovered thier wonderful selection of beers.  gallo, which has a big picture of a rooster on the front.  some people might be akin to calling this beverage "cock beer" but of course that kind of crass language is far beneath me.  the other beers are victoria and brahava.  both are good, especially when consuming them repeatedly in the one liter quanity. san pedro is jesustown usa.  errr...strike that.  jesustown guatemala.  on ever building is painted some little catch phrase.  dios te ama.  jesus es el senor. etc.  its like TBN stormed the town with a battallon of spirit-filled graffitti artists. despite all the hippieness, mayan saleswomen, born-again vandalism...no wait, because i all that i love it here.  it�s like no other place ive ever been.  its like ive slipped through somekind of dimentional loop, wormhole or someother equally spooky sounding sci-fi thing i would see on an episode of the x-files.  all this to say, i could stay here for a while.  amigos, forward my cell phone payments, biola loans, insurance bills to:  dmh, big chill place on the lake near where all the mayan womwn wash their clothes, san pedro GUATEMALA.
