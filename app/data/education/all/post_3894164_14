I got an email today from the Washington Center detailing a bunch of the different things that I will be doing in Boston. It seems this thing actually has some academic merit to it after all. It was a laundry list rundown of the different tasks that I have to complete while I am there.  Turns out that I have to interview five random people at the convention, read a book and write a report on it, keep a daily journal, and write two different papers while I am there. All of this in a matter of about 12 days or so. And here I thought it was going to be a cake walk and nothing more than a vacation for me. Who knew that politics was going to involve actual work.   Oh well, at least this will actually help me when I have to turn things in to Dr. Helm for three hours worth of internship credit. I just hope that I will gain some ideas on how to get more people involved in the whole process when I get back to Western this fall.  I guess I am just complaining for the sake of complaining. I know that this is going to be alot of fun while I am in Boston, and the experience is one that I will look back on fondly. In a few days it will all begin and then in a blink of an eye it will all be over.
