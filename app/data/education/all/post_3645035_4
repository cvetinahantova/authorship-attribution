Who knows about the rest of you, but manly advances are both welcome and valid. Or in-invalid, if it suits you(you of course could be Vincent).  In fact all of you could be Vincent.  In fact we all are Vincent.                             Item A; All passed gas is subservient to the gas that is its lord and                            master(that of Vincent Chung), and all gas passed is but echoes and                           offspring of its master.  All gas therefore is directly related to Vinny.                           Item B; All bastardizations of the English language are endearing and                           therefore are emblazoned on our psyche.  Who will forget the aforementioned                          accidental witticisms, and fun sayings(I was saying them for months.                           Item C; Vinny is thin and fit, but could be diseased(a bit to thin).  Being                          Vincent would make me personally much lighter.           Whatever you choose to beleive  I'm  beleiving me.  You could be Vincent.  Vincent..All Vincent.  Thank you very much, and please stop insulting yourself, you could embarass yourself heavily by failing to beat yourself up.
