so last night liz and i wandered around searching for something cheesy.  a classy pasta joint wasn:t serving yet so we set out to find torishin, which we:d heard about from some locals.  it:s a good sign when you ask a random group of japanese men on the street where an eatery is and they all happily lead you right to it.  so, no cheese, but incredible yakitori, which literally means grilled chicken.  it:s a closet of a place decorated with tons of pages of japanese writing everywhere, maybe menus.  there:s a long bar made of light-colored, well-sanded wood- it:s beautiful.  we have a seat and the master hands us a broken-english menu, ahhh...  [he spoke decent english which he said he:d learned from customers over the years]  we opted for chicken breast meat with wasabi and plum glaze, chicken meatballs, shemeji mushrooms and chicken, onion and green pepper sticks with a soy glaze [all skewered and seasoned with `secret spice` then cooked on a long narrow grill behind the bar].  we also had a plate of chilled radish, cucumber, eggplant, garlic, carrot and some unidentifiable vegetable pickles.  yeah, just whole pickled garlic cloves, yum.  throw in a bowl of rice and a couple of draught beers...near perfect meal. whoever musters a visit, i:m dragging you there.
