today was quality indeed.  after church, i worked on packing for my trip to memphis, and then helped scott start his move from the dorms on campus to the house where he, john, eric, mike, sam, and jared will be in the fall... in return he promised me a drink on him later. -- party indeed :-)  after a little more work at my place, jessica came up from philly, helped me bring a load of stuff down to my car, and then we watched the 2nd half of "ferris bueller's day off" before scott got back home from playing basketball..   he, ben, jessica and i went to applebees for munchies and drinks -- i got a mucho mudslide, on scott because he's a party :-)  then, we picked up colleen and headed for highland park... (where i'll live in a month) :-) -- they had a local band called "deSol" what was pretty fun... scott and ben juggled and played with my hackeysack and made some small children friends while jessica and i worked on making clover flower jewelry; jessica made herself a crown, and i made a necklace that scott volunteered to wear before i even finished... with him wearing it and continuing to play with his small children friends, i ended up being a flower necklace factory and making them for all scott's new 4 foot tall friends :-)  ben and me also got glow-sticks and had fun waving them around until fireworks started :-)  and they were fun... actually, highland park didn't set any off -- they just set everyone up facing the fireworks from the town across the river (new brunswick) which is a little over... trees blocked the lower ones, but the high up ones, which were 80% of the show, were fantastic! :-) it was a party :-)  now, i'm back home, and should ponder getting some sleep before the roadtrip tomorrow :-)  jersey to pittsburgh tomorrow, pittsburgh to memphis on tuesday, via columbus for lunch with travis -- catch y'all on the flip side :-)
