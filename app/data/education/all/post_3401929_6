This morning seemed to drag on forever.  First, in English there was a vocab. quiz, but then Logan and I left for Enrichment.  Second period, I missed Algebra to go to band.  Then, I had to finish up the CBA (Curriculum Based Assessment tests) during third period; after the tests I went to FCS for the remainder of the period.  We watched Mrs. Eberhart demonstrate cinnamon rolls.  Fourth period, we had music.  It was the only morning period I had without any interruptions.  We worked on our CD projects most of the time, and we didn't stay in our chairs often.  Lunch was, well, lunch.  Social Studies...we had three quizzes on South and Southeast Asia.  I think I did pretty well on them.  Then, we discussed the Cosmic Voyage movie in Science that we had watched on Friday...thank God I took notes!  Finally, we gave our little presentations on the chapter of Tom Sawyer that we read in Communications. Tonight there is a banquet at the Middle School at 1830 hours for everyone in eighth grade who has been on the honor roll all four years and who has achieved an 88% or higher on the PSSAs (Pennsylvania State Assessment Tests).  I am still getting ready for it, which I have been doing for over an hour now.
