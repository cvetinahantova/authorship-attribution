I am happy that most people tried to post a survey on themselves.  I want to say again that those are really cool.  Spencer, your story brings an extra stench to the blog that somehow makes people keep coming back for more.  Feel free to find more stories like that.  Josh, how's the dogsitting?  Paige, hang in there.  Life gets better.  At least that's what I was told to believe.  Ambur, Spencer and I are okay now and we didn't have to solve it through the blog.  Why?  Cause then other people could get involved and it's just not needed.  And I have to say stuff like IM me so that he knows I possibly feel this isn't the place to argue.  That atmosphere is better except for the methane emissions coming from Ryan's Steakhouse.  (note to self:  don't say methane emissions on this website ever again)  Okay, still waiting for that chance for us to all get together.  It's a sort of taboo.  We need to work it out.
