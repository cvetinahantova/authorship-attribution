I have so many wonderful memories of Uncle George I don't know where to begin. I'm Catherine, George's niece by marriage to Jackie, Freddie's little girl most would say. What I loved most about Uncle George was how he seemed comfortable no matter where he was or what he was doing. Whether he was ordering us a table at the finest restaurant in town, or picking beans in grandma's garden. And he always shared with me whatever he was doing, and if I couldn't help, well he always let me help. And his laugh, how I'll miss his stories and his laugh. He always made me feel important and that anything was possible if I put my mind to it. When you first met George he seemed like a hand shake kind of guy, but he gave me the best hugs. Hugs and Kisses to you all!
