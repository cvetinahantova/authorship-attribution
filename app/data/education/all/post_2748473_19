All this school and then work and homework is gonna beat me down eventually.  I'm gonna be gone most of the weekend at this youth event with Ardmore, which should be fun.  I'm kind of feeling like I'm floating along right now and I'm desperately hoping to feel like myself again.  I can't meet  Losing sleep over this  No I can't  And now I cannot stop pacing  Give me a few hours  I'll have this all sorted out  If my mind would just stop racing   Cause I cannot stand still  I can be this unsturdy  This cannot be happening   This is over my head  But underneath my feet  Cause by tomoroow morning I'll have this thing beat  And everything will be back to the way that it was  I wish that it was just that easy   Cause I'm waiting for tonight  Been waiting for tomoroow  I'm somewhere in between  What is real  Just a dream  What is real  Just a dream  What is real  Just a dream   Would you catch me if I fall out of what I fell in  Dont be surprised if I collapse down at your feet again  I don't want to run away from this  I know that I just don't need this   Cause I cannot stand still  I can be this unsturdy  This cannot be happening   Cause I'm waiting for tonight  Been waiting for tomorrow  And I'm somewhere in between  What is real  Just a dream  What is real  Just a dream  What is real  Just a dream  What is real just a dream   And you can't see when all your dreams are coming true.................
