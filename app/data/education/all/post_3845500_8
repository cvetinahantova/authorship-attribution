I've found a new bit of software that might encourage me to make use of all those GPS co-ordinates I took whilst travelling.  It is called  urlLink worldKit , but I'll need to have a closer look at the documentation to see how much use it will be.  I'll need to use it in conjunction with mapping or image data, perhaps NASA's  urlLink Earth Observatory ? Especially the  urlLink Blue Marble  images, if I can find the disc space to store them.  Also stumbled upon the  urlLink Visible Earth  page.  Some really nice TIFF images from parts of the world.   urlLink Michael Moore  has started a  urlLink weblog of his own .  Just one day before I started mine, although I wonder why someone as media-savvy as he is hasn't done it before, the nearest he has come is a mailing list with very sporadic posts.  I'm in two minds on the guy, I used to respect him, and I still want to like what he is saying, but he is getting ever more extreme and starting the use the same tactics as the party he is fighting against when it comes to diverting the media's attention.
