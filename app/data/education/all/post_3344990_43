Jesus Connect Ministries went offline on March 5, 2002.  Without any warning the doors were closed and locked and the network is down.  Now, I am having to rebuild our family website and redirect all of my stuff.  That stinks.  Our family website is now located at http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jcmoffitt1. This site is still under construction. Our MyFamily.com community is located at http://moffittfamily.myfamily.com
