It's the time of year when we can all dress up in red and white, wave our flags, forget the worries of the country, and with one strong voice, yell:  Happy Canada Day!!!!.  I'm a very proud Canadian, and have been lucky enough to have travelled the world over. I've been to many other countries, and I've always been glad to be back home in Canada. Every province and territory is unique. The people are caring, unselfish, passionate, diverse, friendly, and above all maintaining the ability to laugh and smile at ourselves and others. We welcome all to our country, we leave our doors unlocked and without fear, we wander, we wonder, and we explore. Our culture is a combination of all other cultures and diverse ethnic backgrounds. I am proud to be a Canadian and I am proud of the Country we all live in.  Even though the elections are over and their was a great amount of disappointment in the way our government is running, we are still largely considered the best country in the world to live. (I voted for the Green Party). I hope that our politicians have learned that we are watching them, and if they screw up again, we'll take action. We are a forgiving people, but hopefully we are not all that gullable that we believe what they are trying to feed us.  A minority government is a good start, and a strong statement.  I hope you all have a great year, and good lives.  RLB   Freedom is precious...just ask those that do not have it
