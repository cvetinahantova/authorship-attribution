Ah, there's nothing like a little Morrissey to remind you how great your life is.  My joy has faded; I have come down from my natural high. Even Morrissey can only barely help ease the immense sense of frustration, irritation and/or anger I feel every time Em speaks. Yes, she arrived, quietly, at lunchtime today and suddenly everything is back to "normal", right down to the return of my underlying reluctance to come to Worcester. It's not an optimistic visit to Dad's house anymore, it's regular punishment; imprisonment for a whole weekend with the remnants of his life, the dregs he scraped out the bottom of the barrel labelled "people I've fucked over". At least now I know it's not Dad that causes me stress though: it's Em, with all her talk of, well,  her , and whether she can find a place in her garden where she can sunbathe in the nude (seriously), or how is was her that created the monster that is Rich (grr), or how she really needs to be at home with Lee right now (melodramatic? Em? What a surprise). The most annoying thing I find about her self-centredness is that after a while, I end up competing with her- she's going to see a band live, I've seen two this week; she likes sunbathing, I've been out in the sun constantly recently; she doesn't like Rich, I hate him with the passion of a thousand suns. And it pisses me off that I end up like her when she's around, because what she is is everything I hate. Ooh, she'd love it if she knew I was writing about her...  Ceff x   It's OK to be angry and never let go
