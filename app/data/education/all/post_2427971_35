today i had no life... i woke up at 11, turned on the computer and didn't move. i was to tired to do anything else, didnt feel like going anywhere at all... wasnt in a good mood anyways. DAoC has taking my home life, i really prefer it haden't but I have no choice to this point... i finished some pictues in photoshop and started some. had fun with that, or something... i was gonna go downtown and play magic but that wouldve required going downtown, so i didnt. i dont know what to put down atm, so i wont put any more... cya
