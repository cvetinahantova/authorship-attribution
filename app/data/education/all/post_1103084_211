. virtues and vices .  the new blogger user interface asked me if, because i push snooze on my alarm clock, i was lazy. nope. i typed.  just tired.   and if i were to go into it -- i'd go so far as to say that its much more of a symbol of my ambition in tension with my finitude.    it is my ambition that drives me to set my alarm clock to 5 or 5:30 every morning -- mostly so i can have writing time.  it is my exhaustion that often motivates me to take a few minutes of rest before i attack the day.   so laziness isn't my vice -- nor is ambition my virtue.   i'm quite confident, though that *distraction* is my vice -- is well roundedness the accompanying virtue?   ambition + distraction is the equivalent of a driverless vehicle careening forward on a full tank of gas.   peace~
