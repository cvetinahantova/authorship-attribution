Charles Kuffner at  urlLink offthekuff.com  seems to be hosting a bit of a debate between me and Bill Bishop and Robert Cushing.  They are the authors of the Austin American Statesman  urlLink report  on political segregation that I criticize in my article  urlLink  "Red and Blue Scare"  .  The article now includes Bishop and Cushing's  urlLink response  and my  urlLink counter-response  to them.
