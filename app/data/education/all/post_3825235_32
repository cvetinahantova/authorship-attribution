So, today was my last day at work for a couple of weeks.  (I am planning to have to work for a couple of weeks next semester before I can quit...because I still haven't heard from the bank.)  I am so stoked that I have a couple of weeks off.  I have so many ideas of things I can do to spend time with Abbie.  She's watching TV right now, but after lunch, I am planning to take her out for a while.  She wanted to go to the zoo, but I think we need to do that on a day when I did not work for half a day already.  Soon enough.  So, I am in a quandary.  What do you buy a friend for a birthday when you have just begun talking to them for the first time in almost a year?  You know, more than seeing her in the hall and waving to each other...  It is a long story, but we just got too busy and life started happening all around us and ripped us apart.  I am thinking about girly stuff like from Bath & Body Works, but don't know if that would seem too last-resort-ish, you know?  But, hey, I like getting that kind of stuff...mostly because it's for me and not AbbieDabbie.  (Most of what I get goes to her, in a way...Amen if you hear me...:))  Off to another subject.  Next semester is quickly upon us and as much as I am looking forward to it, even waiting for it to come, I am not looking forward to the time away from Abbie-girl.  My heart is torn.  But, not working is going to be a good step to give me more time with her.  Random  OK, another soul-bearing moment.  Do you believe that God gives a glimpse of what He has in store for us sometimes?  It might be to keep us on track or to bring us back, but I think he does.  It's a long story, but I just would like to have some feedback.  You know, to see if anyone reads my blog.  :)  Well, off to the park.  Be back soon.
