Has anyone been to Newport?  Dee and I were thinking of going at some point in the middle of August.  We've never been, and I was just curious about things to do in the town, the museums, the restaurants.  Someone in my office just got back from there and she said that she had a lovely time.  I really really really want to go to check out the museums.  I've been desperate to go see some of them since I studied this stuff in architecture history with caitlin!
