It's a pity, I don't write frequent enough.  I am to fix that.  I will handwrite at least one paragraph per day, and type it out here.  At least my journal will have some infomation.  I suppose it looks pretty dead at some point, but it can be better.  I did get a vist from my angellic neice yesterday.  She's so sweet.  I love when she visits.  Also bought a digital camera, so I'm trying to get all the kinks out.
