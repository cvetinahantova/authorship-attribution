I did my laundry and stuff and made my bed... I love the smell of new sheets. I haven't slept on them yet, of course, but whatever.  Anyway, I also got bored and thought I'd try out the Prince of Persia demo to see how it is on PC. I must say I much prefer it on PlayStation 2, and I was sorely disappointed by the demo, just because I love that game so much and it was far too short of a demo... hehe... not really a good reason, but whatever.  Right. I also downloaded Sacrifice, a game I had played once before, and I must say it's a very cool game, although I don't think I'll ever overcome the confusions of the interface... it's a strategy game, where you control different units and such, but it's from the third-person, where you are a wizard controlling all of your units. Also, you can summon, cast spells and so on--the usual stuff. Anywho, it has great graphics and very interesting gameplay, but it's hard... hehe.    Whatever. I'm going to go make myself busy. Do enjoy yourselves.    Current Music:  The Smashing Pumpkins - Love
