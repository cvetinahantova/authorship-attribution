"Roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair."  - Bruce Springsteen   That's what this blog is all about, right there.  My hope, dear reader, is that anytime you want to have that refreshing, exhilirating experience of sticking your head out of a moving vehicle, without the risk of looking like a dog, or of being beheaded by a passing semi, you will set your browser compass to transcendentalfloss.  It is WAY too scary to boast that we will always be a breath of fresh air.  On the contrary, it may occasionally happen that you'll have to contend with periodic gaseous emissions.  I will promise you, however, that we will always do our best to leave the smallest possible footprint on our beloved spaceship earth, and we will never knowingly contribute to global warming.    Enjoy.
