hey everyone,  well i think i'm starting to enjoy teaching.  hard to believe considering all the teachers i tortured in my day.  anyway...  i have a few i'd like to apologize to if i could.  today i've taught cross-stitching, english, reading, and substituted for an art class.  i've learned that being flexible is very important.  there is no organization at st. joe so as long as you look busy it's easy to get away with doing whatever you want.  sister erlinda, the head crazy, caught me on the internet today in the computer room which is supposed to be for students only.  i played dumb and since i'm new it worked.  anyway...  i'd say the most important thing a person needs for teaching is an imagination.  i didn't even know i had one until i realized that if i didn't keep the kids busy they would be going wild.  anyway... another comment on the level of just how spoiled these kids are:  they are extremely well off by thai standards.  they all have maids and other workers doing everything for them.  in one exercise that they had to complete about the environment and preserving energy a question asked them what they would do if a worker left the refrigerator door open.  most of the answers involved the worker being fired. like i said before these girls are brats.  well other than that not much to tell basketball was loads of fun yesterday. i enjoyed playing with the teachers and and the kids.  my skills with the ole b-ball hadn't completely left me.  i even managed to teach a couple of the girls how to dribble behind their backs.  i think i might make it a regular activity for me to play with them every afternoon.  god knows i need the exercise.  love ya'll jane
