Quick Blurb on animal rights    I was just thinking this the other day. You hear of all those healthy people living and talking about animal rights, and OH I think it's so bad to hurt animals! Yet, I wonder, or maybe I should ask if they wonder or realize this. But were they ever immunized??? Gosh, I am sure probably 90% of the old ones were, and heck if they didn't know, the stupid vaccines they were inoculated with were made in EGGS! And heck studies were doing exposing those vaccines to mice to make sure the vaccines were good enough for those animal right busters! Mmm...seems to me like a hypocracy. I'm sure all those animal rights peeps out there now, probably won't get their kids immunized. Yah, they say maybe a teeny % get sick from vaccination, and these animal lovers wanna love their animals, just not their kids. Watch when those kids get sick..then what?     Mmm...There are ways to test things w/o hurting animals brutally as they claim (is the only way!). I did research, and I'll tell you, there is too much of ethics involved in it!! I mean I had to redo this or that, and delay this or that, because I forgot the paperwork. ANd I had to state explicitely about what I did to the animals! So heck, I know when I put those mice under, they were getting state of the art treatment that I would have got when I was put under for wisdom teeth extraction!
