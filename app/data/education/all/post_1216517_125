I really need to quit posting in here, but I can't. I don't have a lot to do.  Dude.  I wish I was a stay-at-home dad.  I could watch some dope TV and look up baseball stats on the computer all day.  They have the best shows on in the daytime.  First up,  urlLink Live Regis and Kelly . Awesome.  Kelly's a babe and Regis is the coolest tv personality since  urlLink William Shatner .  Then you've got the  urlLink Today Show  with Katie Couric and, dude, we all know that Katie is the hottest of them all.       Yeah, Katie's a babe.  But the best reason to stay home is  urlLink Passions . This soap opera is as good as it gets.  When I first flicked it on, there was a witch with a mask on chopping down a door. Inside, there was a monkey jumping up and down, a retarted woman screaming and some guy yelling "that's the woman that stole my baby!".  It rocks.   urlLink READ THIS!!!  It's funnier than crap.  It tells a little about the 'supernatural shenanigans' on the show.  Read it.  It is hilarious.  I got it from the Passions website.  Yep.
