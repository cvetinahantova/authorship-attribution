Mending misconceptions    Disclaimer: please don't take this personally . Some people seem to think that I am a really nice person. I just want them to know that I'm not. Sure, I  try  to be nice, and I haven't done many un-nice things lately, but I'd like for everyone to know that that's only one side of me. The other side (which I hope none of my friends will ever see) has done really bad things in the past, and this is just one of my ways for making up for it.  There are other reasons for me to make an effort to be nice, which I won't disclose right now, though they are more important than my need to make up for old wrongs. Maybe one day I'll tell y'all about it.  So what's my point, you ask... my point is, o faithful reader, that those who know me should be wary that there is a bad side to me, and I wouldn't want them to put too much trust in me and then get deceived by my other self. That would hurt their feelings, and I couldn't live with myself if I ended up hurting my friends for trying to be a better person.
