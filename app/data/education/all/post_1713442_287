Yes, you are at the  Information Literacy Land of Confusion .  It looks different now because I changed the blog design.  I think this looks better and more dignified than my old plain basic look.  I also have changed the settings so that each post creates a seperate web address for that post.  However, I have declined to turn posting of reader comments on.  I fear the spam bots...
