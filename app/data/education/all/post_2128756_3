Damn it. I'm not supposed to feel this. Not ever again. I'm not supposed to feel this stomach churning spiral into emotion. I feel as though I'm on top of some mountain and he's swinging off the edge by some invisible soul rope attached to my goddamn stomach. It's painful saying goodbye to him. It's painful thinking about how easy it would be to fall into him. And I like it. I love it. And I never ever want it to stop. Ever. Because it means something very important. It means I'm alive. It means I've been dead and it's time to wake up and roll back the stone and say, Damn it, I  am  the son of God! My life is one huge steaming heap of fertile moist potentiality. And I'm so scared of using it. But I think I might. I think I might.  Still, it really tears my heart out to say goodbye. But I've had to do it before. I say goodbye to my old life a thousand times a day.  Everytime I walk away from my sons' house and go somewhere without them, I say goodbye. Everytime I see Lora and know that I hurt her, I say goodbye. Everytime I see a map of England and think about where on it my Dad is I say goodbye. I say goodbye everyday.  Which of course means I haven't said goodbye at all.
