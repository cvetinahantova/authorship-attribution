First week at my new School now done and it went pretty well.  My first day with pupils was pretty bewildering but I wasn't the only one in that situation.  Teaching Geography and RE as well as History which is fun but challenging and have some good classes and some other ones.  But I think I'm getting the hang of it.  One of the best bits was doing break duty on Friday.  I was out in the School Yard and a lot of the kids (who apparently I teach, but most them I could not recognise) would come and talk to me- was fun.    So yeah,  I'm glad I'm a teacher.   Finally saw Donnie Darko the other day.  Wanted to watch it for ages but never seemed to get there.  Wow... what a film.
