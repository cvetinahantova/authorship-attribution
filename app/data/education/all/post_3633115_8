I hate housework.  I don't have a dishwasher, so when the dishes get behind, they seem to take over the entire kitchen.  If you don't do the dishes after every meal, the next thing you know there is a mutiny in the works.  I have tried going on "strike."  Unfortunately that doesn't work.  S does try to help, but somehow I always end up having to finish what he has started.  This is usually silverware, and the pots and pans.  Sure, plates and bowls are easy, why do the hard stuff, when the easy stuff can be done? Ugh.
