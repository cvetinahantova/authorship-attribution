First there was the  urlLink Raspberry Filled Krispy Kreme .  Then there was the  urlLink Second Level of Hell  (Helen and Cleopatra, oh yeah!).  There followed a pause in time to explore my  urlLink ancient inner child , and of course, one mustn't neglect my frequent  urlLink adventures in insanity .  Oh, yes, I almost forgot, I am always the  urlLink eternal dreamer and gameplayer .  But wait!  The best is yet to come!    Magic!    You just gotta love magic. As it turns out, I am indeed, magical!    urlLink        urlLink find your element  at  urlLink mutedfaith.com .    Can't beat that with a stick!  But when you put them all together, where does it really leave me?  Somewhere buried in all these symbols and oddities is hidden the real me, the one who loves playing Lineage II all day long, fishing in quiet country streams, watching NASCAR on ESPN, and reading Harry Potter after the kids have gone to bed.  I am all these things and more, but the one thing I am not, never have been, and never will be, is "normal".   Whatever that means!
