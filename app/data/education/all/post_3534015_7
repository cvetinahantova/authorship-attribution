Everyone needs a pedicure once in their lifetime.  It's truly an awesome experience.  I got my fingernails and toes done today.  They are very pretty.  It's hard not to be vain.  My hands look so nice and my toes just feel great!! :D  In other news, I've been asked (again!) to join the Campus Crusade staff as an Affiliate member.  They have started a message board and would like me to basically take the reins of it.  They want me to be a moderator and really get it going.  To do this, I must be Staff.   I am going to think and pray about it.  I am uncertain.  I have been asked SOO many times in so many ways.  I don't want to take on a commitment I cannot fulfill.
