hello,  well things are going o.k. here.  moving to new facilities has caused the  chaos that i imagined, but i means that sister erlinda is to busy to bother  the farangs.  thank god.  also, she has it in her mind that i am an  exceptionally good teacher which means i am flying under the radar right  now.  i can pretty much do as i please in the classroom which is good and  bad.  since i don't have any books to go by i really have to be creative and  sometimes it works perfectly and other times i have to abandon the lesson  plan and wing it.  some things i've started to notice about thailand recently:  1.  there are some very large thai people.  at first i thought everyone was  a size one but now i'm noticing that there are quite a few obese people  walking around.  i would be willing to bet that this is due from the  american influence here.  2.  people aren't as strict about their cultural rules as i thought they  would be.  i often see people wearing sleeveless shirts, pointing at people,  and changing in front of one another at the gym.  (when i first joined i was  told that only farangs change in front of others and that i should go to the  changing room)  3.  while the thai are buddist this does not mean that a fight won't break  out.  two days ago i saw a brawl in the middle of the street.  men and women  were fighting and throwing things at one another.  i'm not sure what was  going on but i think it has to do with a new food vendor moving into  another's territory.  well i've gotta go teach some little monsters.  hope eveyone is enjoying  themselves.  also anyone headed to the neshoba county fair think of me.  i  hate that i'm missing it.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ MSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page Â FREE  download! http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/
