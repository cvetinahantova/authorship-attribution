[part one]  The teacher encodes his lesson plan in his personal terminal in the faculty room and submits it to the head teacher's terminal.  The lesson plan is sent to the server after the head teacher approves the lesson plan.  The server then searches the database for the tools and background needed for the classroom or uses its GPS (global positioning system) to pinpoint the location of a certain place in the world and sets its satellite image as the background.  The server may use both the database and the GPS to make the background look like the events of the past, from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the age of dinosaurs.  It also makes the equipment blend in with the atmosphere, and the temperature can be automatically set according to the background or customized for comfort.  The backgroud can be set according to the schedule of the faculty's class and the room where it will take place.
