It's early.  it's a class day.  Learned about creating business cards today.  I need to get up and walk.  My legs are stiff.  I have to go to work today, to make up for the library being closed on Sunday.  Boy is that fun.  My only consolation is that the library is going to close at 6:00 PM tonight.  I'll more than likely write another entry at work, 'cause nobody wants to be seen at the library on Fridays.  LOL  Misplaced my ring today.  I'll stop by the house before I run to work, and reclaim it.
