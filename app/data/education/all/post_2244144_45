Eric Neel, an excellent sports writer, is right on the money about  urlLink The Streak . It is just plain overrated. Actually all baseball stats that include something that involve the word "consecutive" are just plain pointless. Like this year when ESPN touted Ken Griffey Jr. as having 7 straight games with a HR. They played this more than when Barry Bonds hit 73 in a season. Which is more important?  Of course the 7 straight games with a HR is not even that bad of a stat. There are even worse oddities that you will see. Some of these stats include "Dallas has defeated San Antonio seven straight times when the game starts at 6:07 PM on a Tuesday" or "Mike Mussina has an ERA of 2.5 while starting day games at Yankee Stadium against the Brewers". And if you think I am making this up, you must not watch and/or listen to enough sports broadcasts.
