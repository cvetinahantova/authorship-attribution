Well, we stayed up really late last night playing an insanely boring game of Starcraft. It was a special map, as opposed to original... you start with a single marine, as does everyone else. There are zerg and protoss computers all around the outside of the map, and five invincible bunkers in the middle. So, each player gets their own bunker to hide in. Also, if you stand in the center of the map, it's a healing zone, so you can just stand there and hit the stim pack button if there isn't too much stuff attacking, and you'll be able to hold it off. Finally, there's an array of buildings around the outside of the center (so not as far out as the enemies) and they all have corresponding beacons. So, if your unit stands on a beacon, you control the building and you can build more units or upgrade. The only way you get money to do that is by killing things. Finally, to finish the game, someone has to make it to one of the 4 crystals in the corners of the map, which are insanely well guarded.  Long game.  Ok, I'm going to my brother's house today, and won't be back until late tomorrow, so everyone have fun doing whatever you're doing.  Current Music: The Mars Volta - Drunkship of Lanterns
