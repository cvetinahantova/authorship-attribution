I absolutely love dancesports.. Went for my first dance lesson on tues evening and learnt some basic Cha Cha steps.. Haha.. Too bad there were very few guys so i was partnered with a girl.. So guys if you're reading this, please give dancesports your fullest support by joining ok lolx.. If you need any more information on dancesports, can go look for Deny or Daryl.. They'll happily dispense what you need to know keke.. Well, we had some laughs and occasional steps on each others' feet and bumping into one another.. But i never regretted the decision to join dancesports.. I can't wait for my next lesson.. Hmm.. Tests round the corner.. Getting the jitters and to make matters worse, i'm down with flu.. The weather has been pretty hot lately.. Sickening..    --*-- Miss me?--*--
