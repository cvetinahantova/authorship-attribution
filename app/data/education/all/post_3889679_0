Ding dong, the kids have gone, and after the drama of our gas leak yesterday, Cat and I are now safely back in our rooms.  And the campus is quiet - Kathryn, Louise and I will just have to work for three or four hours and then our weekend kicks off.  Should be an OK one, but really I am all about getting my room started on being sorted and reading to pack up before heading home.  Yes.  Tonight was pretty nice - Daphne, Cat and I went to see   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  , finally.  It was really good, I thoroughly enjoyed iy  , but I am kind of nervous to estimate what they may do to my favourite of the books,   Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  !!  Then we all went for pizza, and I had nice phone chats with Natalie and Val.  Val is almost recovered from the trauma of last term, and Natalie and I are meeting for dinner and drinks on Saturday.  Am glad I've had a few ops to see her whilst I've been down in Londonshire.  Right, am going to go watch an ep of   Sex and the City   now!  Current music:  the   Sex and the City    theme tune Current mood: fine Last person spoke to: the ever lovely Cat, whilst she waxed her legs (oh, the joys of living together!! :-)) Next:   Sex and the City  , closely followed by no sex in bed.  Seriously, how long has it been?  About two years you say?  Dayum....
