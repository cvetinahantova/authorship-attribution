it might be hot if... the popsicles you took out of the freezer melt to liquid within 10 minutes of when you took them out... and you're inside!  current temp 91, heat index 97, lows in the 70s... and does my roommate believe in air conditioning?  um nope..  after 4 hours of working with the windows open and a fan and still having a headache despite drinking like 2 liters of water already today, i gave up, shut the windows, and turned on the AC... too bad it's not in my room!  now, back to work... goal of 850 today, currently at 769... wish me luck =P  later dudes
