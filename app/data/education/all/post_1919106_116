urlLink Let the show begin    Well, I finally got to a point where I can rest. Believe it or not, today is the first day here that I'm not lagging behind with some kind of assignment. Shame that it won't last long - tomorrow I got to do the presentation I've been working on during most of the weekend. It's supposed to be just 20 minutes, so I've had to do a lot of work cutting back on material. I've pretty much dumped all of the math part.  Then of course there's the project for Software Architecture. After lots of struggling (and giving up) with software that depended on GTK but wouldn't build I decided to go with non-GUI software. First choice was lam-mpi, but that didn't work out because the tools used to build the architectural landscape have trouble parsing cxx objects. So I tried ssh, and finally got something working all the way. Now the only decision is whether we'll write the concrete architecture of it (it's rather small for that) or if we'll trace the evolution of the system. Eh, we'll see.  Now, if you haven't clicked the above link, do so. There's a really neat video there. I keep getting amazed at the neat stuff Hubble finds. Now if only the folks at NASA were to stop being such asshats and worry more about the scientific value of Hubble than about politics and money, then we could look forward to many more pretty things from the space telescope. But as it stand, they won't do a damned thing to maintain it, so it is expected that the chance of its orbit decaying and Hubble burning up in our atmosphere by 2006 is about 50%. And going up. The worst thing is that the next space telescope is not scheduled to be launched until 2014. That's 8 years of stalled astronomy. But NOO, instead they work on space weaponry. Idiots.
