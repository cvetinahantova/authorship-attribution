We rolled into the house (a wonderfully clean house, thank you Ris) about midnight last night.  Just got up watched a little world series action (mom are you watching this year?).  Going to Costco and then will post tonight or tomorrow (I have taken the rest of the week off of work to recover from this weekend) with a try at posting pictures.
