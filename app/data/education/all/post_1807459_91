I think my life my be stuck in high gear permenatly.  This isn't bad in and of itself but I can feel it taking a toll on my body.  I wish I just had a few days to sit at home and just hang out.  Last night was Tim's B-day.  We ate at Outback.  It was a good meal.  We were joined by several of his female friends, whose names I've all forgotten as well as Asma, Andrea and Caleb.  Gabe showed up later at Bellagio later for some drinks.  There was a drink special last night at Bellagio and we ended up getting 5 drinks for free.  Not too bad.  I owe Asma b/c she spotted me for my drinks.  Thank you.  I hadn't planned to eat at Outback and thus didn't have enough money for both booze and food.  Conan also gave us some chocolate for free.  I think I forgot to mention we got him a cake on Saturday night and then sang to him.  He is a cool guy.  We even lured him into playing a round of Titanic.  It was obvious the shot glass was close to sinking to I told him to be careful.  He just responded with "don't worry, I'm a bartender."  Then as he was about to break out some real pouring skill Asma thwarted his technique by smacking the bottle and thus causing him to sink the cup and drink.  Anyway back to yesterday.  There was a serious discussion of politics that happened.  I wish I wasn't so tired but since I was, I was just happy to sit on the side lines and listen.   Tonight is movie night with Gyeh-son so we'll see how that goes.  I'm not at all sure what's going on there.   I'm loving the weather as of late.  Just keep getting warmer please.  I need to clean my room and do laundry.  No spell check, fuck it.
