How Do You Like Your Blue-Eyed Boy, Mr. Death?    urlLink Maud Newton  links to a  urlLink Harry Crews page  with a number of great quotations.  My personal favorites:   "Contrary to popular belief, I’m not a violent person. But if you wrong me, I’ll kill your fucking ass, and I’ll spend the rest of my life in jail. I’ll kill your fucking ass and you can count on it; depend on it."    "Faulkner’s rhetoric is the sea around us whose depth more than one of us has drowned. He is such an overwhelming talent that he has damaged a whole generation of writers, because they all come along and try to be Faulkner and to write about the stuff that to him was a blood-and-bone issue and to them only a kind of romantic nonsense. You see, you can’t fake any of this in art."   I really really want to love this guy's fiction; that the same guy could earnestly make both of the above statements makes him some sort of a genius.  Alas, I have never been able to get into him.   But if you don't believe me, and if the above is your only exposure to Crews than you really have no reason to,  try  A Feast of Snakes .
