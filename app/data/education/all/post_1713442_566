urlLink National Standards for Athletic Coaches. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Jody Brylinsky.  It reviews national standards for coaches.  From the ERIC Digest:  Over a decade has passed since Conn and Razor (1989) proclaimed "a legal and moral responsibility to provide qualified individuals to coach young people" (p. 161) yet there has been little interest in examining how best to develop that level of expertise in professional training (Abraham & Collins, 1998). The question of coach preparation and training has become a priority issue for many schools and communities. However, there is limited research on the inexact science of coaching and the complex dynamic social activity in which the coach is engaged (Jones, Armour, & Potrac, 2002).   Public complaints, including increasing litigation, often claim a failure of coaches to properly instruct skills or techniques, warn of inherent danger/risks, or gain appropriate training prior to assuming leadership responsibility in a sport program (Johnson, 1992). The appointment of unprepared individuals to coaching positions could lead to serious medical problems for the athletes and serious legal problems for sport organizations (Conn & Razor, 1989). Further, investigation of the multifaceted social relationships between coach and athlete is necessary to more fully understand how coach training can be linked to more effectively meeting the psychological and physical development of athletes (Potrac, Brewer, Jones, Armour, & Hoff, 2000).
