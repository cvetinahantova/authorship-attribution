Then I could make a radical life changing commitment to God and be sincere about it. Alas my history has screwed me. I was never ANTI god, and then I became a proper Christian, because it was the right thing to do. As a result I'm now not really FOR god either. My brain has been stuffed with a lot of rhetoric that I'm battling to escape now.  I wish I could start again. Starting again isn't easy.    It's hard to live without the comfort of believing in God, that I can say. I'm trying to be honest and straightforward and only think and talk about what I know for sure. As such I'm trying to put God on hold in my life. I'm sure he doesn't mind, because he knows my ultimate objective is the truth.
