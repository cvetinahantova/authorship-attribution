I could not be more disgusted.  It's obscene.  There should be laws against it.  It's ghastly.  And I couldn't be more amazed by it.  In watching the British Open on TNT this morning, I heard the news.  Tiger's using a new driver.  How I missed this story, I'll never know.  But I learned he is using a blue graphite shafted, Nike Ignite Driver.  And, with that driver, he hit a golf ball 410 yards in a practice round.    410 Yards.    Are you kidding me?  I can't do that on concrete.  I can't do that on XBox.  I can't hit driver/5 iron 410 yards.  It is a ridiculous stat.  And, I may be the only Tiger fan left on the planet (People seem to root against him more than for him), but in my mind it only adds to his lore.  Like I said, it's obscene.  Nobody can do that.  Not even a sober John Daly.    Sure I believe the greatest golfer of our era (besides Rocco Mediate) needs to start hitting it straight or it won't matter.  But I still love to watch Tiger play.  I love the intensity.  I love the swing.  I love the emotion.  Maybe the driver can help him get on track and reclaim the golf world's love too.
