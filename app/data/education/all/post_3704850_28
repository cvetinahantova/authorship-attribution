Will not allow two words (i.e. Physical Plant, Motor Pool) in breadcrumb.  Appears as Physical_plant & Motor_pool.   Cannot use acronyms (i.e. UPS) in breadcrumb.  Appears as Ups.   Use of anchors is not available with relative URLs.  Works occasionally with absolute URLs.  When using anchors, the specfic text which is used as an anchor appears as a link with nothing attached to it.  (Style sheet problem.)
