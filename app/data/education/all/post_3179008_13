One of the students in my classroom has terretes(?) syndrome. About three years ago, when I first met this student, he used to drool on himself and shout out all sorts of words and phrases; as if his mind was not filtering some of the immediate thoughts, and just let them roll out of his mouth. When he was angry he would say stuff like, " fuck you bitch," and " whooooooOOO." He wasn't really aware most of the time, but would apologize or become frustrated when he did notice that he was doing this. Most of the kids were, and are, tolerant. They are very good at ignoring the ticks now. He is on lots of medications, and sometimes the levels are not quite right. He will either be catatonic-like, or ticking like a clock.    Currently he is ticking like a clock. I have been tracking the behavior for three days now, and have come to realize that I was very good at not hearing the ticks. He was vocalizing about three to five times per minute. I noticed that there was a marked increase during his focus on math, and when he is reading. We will have to let the psychiatrist know what is happening. Here comes another med change; probably his tenth in five years.    This particular student also suffers from fetal alcohol and extreme social delay. He is eighteen, but when he becomes angry, or is held accountable for his behavior, he reverts to about four years old. He knows what to do, but when he reaches a certain point reason and impulse control are out the door. The best thing to do is isolate him and keep peers clear of him; cool of period. This is necessary since he is about six foot four inches tall, 300 pounds!   Considering his propensity to intimidate, posture, and threaten physical violence, it's very challenging to maintain peace; recognize the antecedents, prevent other students from "setting up" this student for the fun of it, or the retaliate for events from the past.   Peace, Dave
