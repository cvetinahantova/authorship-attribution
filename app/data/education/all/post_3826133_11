The weekend was nice.  Except for dealing with my (s)Mother, which is quickly becoming a reoccuring theme.  But, whatev.  She's my mum, and I'm going to have to deal with her for the rest of my life, so today, I'm offically filing Mother under the "Does not kill me" category.  I'm putting everything in two categories:  "Does Not Kill Me" or "Will Kill Me."  So far I have "smoking" in the "Will Kill Me" category.  Everything else falls into the other.  I debated for a while on where to put Mum, but I realized that I'm more likely to kill her than she is to kill me.  So into the "Does Not Kill Me." file.    Seester Sekatsim told me the other day that I underestimate myself.  While I don't find this to be true, I was very flattered by it.  I actually printed out the correspondence and I've been carrying it around with me.  I pull it out when I get frustrated or upset and I reread it.  It comforts me.  It makes me happy.    I've decided to look for a different job, as I hate this one and I won't be able to go to school in January anyhow.  I told Sam "Monkeypants, dahling" that if he didn't have an intership within thirty days that I was going to box my house up and move.  So far I'm looking into New Orleans, Austin, and Denver.  Tucson is always a possibility, too, but seeing as how I can't reach Kinsey, I'm crossing it off for now.  He has 28 days left.  Finished painting and rearranging my room this weekend.  Looks nice.  Clean.  Sharp.  On to Lia's room, next.  Pink and green, I think, with frogs and butterflies and whatever else she wants.  The Monkey Princess.  (Or dictator.  Either one works.)  I went to bed at 1830 last night and didn't wake until 0645 this morning.  I feel good!  Poetry day.  I'll be published by Christmas.  Watch.
