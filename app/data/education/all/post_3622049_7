I want a family.  My daughter has been talking a lot about her baby brother.  He hasn't been born yet, and he will be born in August to her step-mom.  The whole thing makes me wistful.  I wanted to be the one who was giving her siblings.  I wanted to have a real family, like the one I grew up in.  Only without the constant fear of divorce, the lying, and the confusion.  I wanted to go on summer vacations, have Christmas mornings at home with the kids, curl up with the man I love at night.  I have these dreams about a little boy with brown hair.  I wanted that. People try to convince me I still have a chance at that and I hope I might.  I just don't know if I can risk it again.  If I'm brave enough.
