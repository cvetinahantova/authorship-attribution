dancing the mysteries into life naked in a world of hobbyists if this were not my fate I would be channel surfing from amateur drama and strife  pop there goes another cell you never know how fragile your best selling fiction is until you come face to face with something that can unveil your hell  I am susceptible to times like this I cannot innocently walk by  a long row of shiny dominoes without giving the closest one  a rough and tumbled kiss  drown in your passions get drunk on your favorite poisons I am an island paradise in your turbulent ocean of self gluttony and rations  my pulse rate never changes my interest level never wanes but if you blink or think too long I will move onto someone who can handle these exchanges  bye bye say I precious little one what you think you may know of our passing experiences will leave you holding smoke when this long day is done  Â©2003 DC Vision
