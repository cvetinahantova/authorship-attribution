Frank and I at Tikal.  I love this picture.  Sorry, i haven't given too much of an update of my houseboat trip.  it was awesome.  I'll post some pictures once they're developed.  Me, shannon, and twelve 7th graders.  It was odd being in the situation of telling kids to quiet down at night when I want to cause trouble too.  "Stop talking about Preparation H." "No more comments about Michael Jackson, Richard Simmons, or Janet Jackson's body parts."   During the week I had a freestyle rap battle (ala Eminem in '8 mile') with Paul, an 8th grader, and lost.  I think of myself as a solid freestyle, but he cut me up.  pulled out stuff like: "you eat Ramen rice noodles" "your shirt from China" "your curly hair." I said I'd "feed him Gerber through a tube in his nose."  but the death blow was when he called me out for spitting the same trick twice in a row.  It was on 'poop' and 'underware' at that.  It was totally 'moted.  Then he killed me off my saying "you use a training razor/and you don't drive a truck, you drive a barbie blazer."  I was dead.  and we had to stop because there were so many people crowding on the houseboat to watch the duel that it was starting to sink.  dope times.
