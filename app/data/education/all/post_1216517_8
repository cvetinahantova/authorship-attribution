THE LAST 10 MONTHS AND ALL IS WELL...  well, what do you know.  it's 10 months, to the day, since I graduated.  how did that that much time pass?  let's recap.  >JUNE, JULY, 1st 1/2 of AUGUST-- worked at  urlLink Mcmaster-Hell  with billy >2nd 1/2 of AUGUST--Trevor's wedding.  Michigan visit. >SEPT & OCT-- Europa con william >1st 1/2 of NOV--Mich visit >2nd half of NOV--Fun california >DEC--unemployed california >JAN--temp job at  urlLink Grainger  (a mcmaster-hell rip-off) >FEB & 1st 1/2 of MARCH--unemployed cali part duex >2nd 1/2 of MARCH--sportswriter darren  and that's the past 10 months.  i guess that's how i got here.  i think i have this fear that time is gonna pass me by.  that someday i'll looke back and say, "today it's been exactly 10 years since i graduated from college.  Now how did i get here?  hmm... let's see...2007?  huh?  what the hell did i do that year?"  see that's my fear.  i think my dream job right now is to be a freelance reporter.  too much war coverage i guess, but i'll give a nod to the email i just recieved from billy.  i need some travel, man.  it's killing me staying in one place.  the funny think is that i just went to  urlLink baja  less than a month ago.  but i've got this bug that's driving me to keep moving.  i love it.  i see these journalists.  and i think, "yeah!  i wanna do THAT."  'course i've gotta take it all with a grain of preverbial salt because i've wanted to be many a thing in my day.  speaking of... i just found out that my job is an  urlLink oxymoron .  funny.  this furthers my desire to get out to the battlefield among the whizzing bullets.
