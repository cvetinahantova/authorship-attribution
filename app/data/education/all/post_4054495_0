I'm not really sure  why  I started this blog. Maybe,  just  maybe, I'm putting this out there because I want people to be able to know me. . . People may listen. But of course that is just a hopeless dream and no one will ever find this. Which could be a saving grace. In some ways, I think this may become more safe and private than a traditional journal. There are infinite places I could hide this on the web, but there are only so many places to hide a book in your bedroom.   Thirty-one days until I'm back in a school desk, back to friends, and back to my life as I know it. It's so strange. . . I want to go back and I don't, but I have to go anyway. But school is school and you just can't change that.   Well, now this window is open, and hopefully the breeze will start fluttering in, and I'll get some fresh air.      P.S. This game is completely out of game, ARG people.
