Today has been a very sweet, settled day. Relaxing. Carol (my boss) said some very nice things and we laughed together. She is a very friendly boss to have, and very approachable. She said that she would have to put up a barrier to stop me leaving and that the school would hold me hostage. I was glad to reassure her that I was devestated to go which, despite some decidely shaking moments, I will be in my heart. I've enjoyed a lot of my time with the school and severel times a day I'm told by a student that they will miss me. Today I have had a pretty day: one of those days where you glide through life on a cloud of beauty and rose water, receiving compliments left and right with the graceful air of a fairytale princess. These days don't happen often enough but, when they do, it's quite nice. Did make one of my students go flustered though: I'm too beautiful. Tonight I will do no homework and no housework. Instead, I will write out a few job-applications and I will write some of my book. It is so much what I want to do in life.
