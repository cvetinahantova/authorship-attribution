The drama continues... J-called me twice yesterday!  He left one of the messages in French.  You see, he gets me!  But K!  K is just K!  Not a call, nor a word!  I have to address our mutual piece of work this afternoon.  I'm leaning towards evasion.    Why am I not attracted to J? & What is wrong with me? And K, who does he think he is?  Right--like he has it all going for him! He's temperamental...  Difficult, very difficult!  And arrogant as hell! Not to mention the fact that he's nine years older than me. H--said last week, "You know, You had a very good relationship with your father; I don't know why you are so attracted to older men."  We had a nice strong laugh about that. K is nothing like my father!  It's crazy.  I feel crazy; nutty!  He's making me absolutely crazy!  I should be grounded in my thoughts and feelings, but this guy is undoing me!  I should just say, "You know, perhaps we should talk about the correct form of past participles--in bed!"  Or "You know, maybe we can debate the problematics of Melville, and Moby Dick in bed."  or better yet, "I think we can put the practicality of appositional phrases better, beneath the sheets, in bed!"    Ah! I don't want to hear or to feel his twisted grammar theories anymore! I am on fire! I am not calling him!  Jumbled Chaos...
