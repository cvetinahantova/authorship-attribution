Aren't we just the talkative group.         Schedule has been flip flopped.. changed around.. I finally have to start worrying about college.      It's funny how things catch you off gaurd. The things you've expected the most. I wish this were as easy for me.      And of course.. Senior Pictures...       I wish this were easier.    But then again, I wish for a lot of things.      If only I weren't just being shrugged off...
