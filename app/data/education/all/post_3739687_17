hello,  well it's official i'm the designated sub.  i'm actually becoming o.k. with it.  the girls hate me because it means one more english class a day but i've learned how to make them behave a little better.  i did have one serious run in today with a girl who i was told later has emotional problems.  anyway... other than that it was a good day.  i've been meaning to mention a few things about thailand that stand out in my mind.  1. the escalators move faster here than they do in the states. 2. they use corn in lots of their desserts.  for example corn shakes at kfc and the dessert today at school was some sort of corn jello mush.  i thought it was disgusting. 3. almost everyone speaks some english.  even poor looking vendors on the street know numbers. 4.  people seem to eat all the time here.  i've never been out and not seen atleast a few vendors selling all types of thai dishes.  anyway... i got an email asking more details about the school i'm working at so here are a few things that might interest you.  first of all there are 5,600 girls (btw it's an all girls school) most of them are very wealthy by thai standards and many of them would be considered  middle class by American standards.  i found out today st. joseph is one of the most respected thai schools (this does not include international schools which are considered in a different class) in bangkok.  the girls wear uniforms  determined by what grade they are in.  starting with jumpers and ending with skirts and button up shirts with ties which are all in blue and white.  well that's all for today. i've got lots of internet research to do so i've got to go.  love ya'll  jane
