Today turned out to be a not-so-good day for a field hockey picnic...especially when you have to walk from the middle school to the park in the rain.  But oh well it was fun. My church has raised at least $100 to help me pay for the cost of the National American Miss Pageant, which will take place July 24-25.  I'm very excited, as soon as school is finished, I'm going to look for a dress. I think I'm going to stick with French...maybe I'll take Spanish in college or maybe my Junior and Senior year of high school.  Parlez vous Francais?  Non. Anyway, I still have algebra to finish.
