Someone please explain to me why some people are so mind-numbingly whiny and lack all sense of reason.  One of my sister's friends went to Japan in late April/early May to teach for  urlLink Nova  with the intention of taking it as an "opportunity to travel for the summer" and then proceed to break her contract in mid-August. Fine. She emails me in late June asking me if I can bring a "small package" for her to which I respond O.K.   provided it is small and light  . She says yes, it is the size of a small shoebox. Fine. Here I am thinking it is insulin or something, as my sister hands me the package today.   It's two litres of maple syrup, one package of KY-type Jelly, two packages of cookies, and EAR WAX 'PICKER' (yes, I'm serious) and a bunch of photographs.  Bear in mind the girl is  leaving to go back to Toronto next month   I said to my sister, you have got to be kidding me. I'm not taking all this crap. She's like why don't you empty out some of your other things to make room. To which I said IT'S CLOTHING THAT I NEED. To which she responded "Well can't you buy clothing there??"  Unreal.  Now I look like the bad guy. I'm taking the crap begrudgingly. Why the hell do I always say I'll do these things, thinking I'll be the  urlLink 5 O'Clock Hero ? I should know better by now.
