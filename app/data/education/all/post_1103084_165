i will lay me down... in a bunker underground.... i won't let this happen to my children... meet the real world comin' out of your shell... with white elephants -- sittin' ducks i will -- -- rise up.    I have the quiet morning buzz of a cup of coffee and a bleak sky and i'm playing radiohead and feeling like the world is coming together, falling apart and i'm falling into the crevice no matter which direction its going.
