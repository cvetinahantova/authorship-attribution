So, what is me? Me seems to be made up of a few things: 'physical me' - I can sense the presence of 'phsical me' by distinguishing it from 'not me' and by my ability to directly manipulate 'me'. 'physical me' is controlled by me - another me. 'non physical me' - this other me can control the movement of 'physical me'. Whether these two are seperate at all is a matter of debate, and not one that I think I'll be able to solve [In this whole rethinking process, I'm not going to be able to escape many of my past presuppositions about reality.]. Regardless, there are at least distinct parts of me, two of which I've mentioned above. In my experience, physical me is an extremely advanced vehicle that allows the non physical me to move, and manipulate the 'not me'. The physical me is however, much more closely linked with the non physical me than a driver is linked with his vehicle. Every tiny movement that the non physical (np) me desires is carried out instantaneously by the physical (p) me. Converesely, every sensation recieved by the np me is instantly given to the p me. The condition of the one directly affects the condition of the other. I believe (irrationally) that the link between the two is very complex.
