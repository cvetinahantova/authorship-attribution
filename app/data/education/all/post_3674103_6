i have recently published a website onto the internet. it's mostly just my stories and poems and the like. nothing to fancy. i've been teaching myself html, css, and javascript lately just for fun. you can visit my site  urlLink here .   i'm also currently working on an online zine. i'm kind of short a few people though (considering it's only me and one other person as of right now). i figured i'd write the code for the site and get the shell finished, then work on the articles and recruiting later. hopefully some of my friends will help me. it won't be anything huge, though. i'm looking for about ten articles and publishing it every two months. i'm aiming to have the first edition by the beginning of september, but nothing is certain yet. i should have the actual site finished in a couple weeks or so, hopefully.
