Ok, so I have to say that I am totally excited today. I have been out of pocket, so I am sorry for not updating my blog. I have been with my youth group in Arlington going to Rangers game and Six Flags. By the way, the Rangers are now tied for first place with the Anahiem Angels. Yes, they did win the game that I went to, Kell, but they lost the second game with them and now are tied for first. Anahiem was in second before the two game series. Exciting stuff. My team hasn't been this good in quite a while. Well, since 1999. Anyway, I have not had computer access. Sorry. By the way...Michelle, this is Lorna Langford. You know, that cool chick that used to come to OBU all the time. Yeah, I am the hottie from H-town. LOL!!!!!!   So, here is the reason that I am in such a good mood...I passed the high school english certification exam. I am now a high school english teacher, too. Who would have ever thought that I would be an english teacher? I don't know. I just got the news about 5 minutes ago and I am totally pumped. God is doing great things for me. My life just keeps getting better. I love this!!!! I am becoming me. Wow!!!! Anyway, I have some celebrating to do. Will post again soon.
