This is the first Monday of the rest of my life. And it is the first of two before I leave on vacaction.   Todays goings on:  * One student is not here ( window breaker ). She may not return, even just a week since we were told to dig in with her. Which was a couple of months after they told us she would be leaving anyday. And so it goes  * Another student is not here ( sleeper ). He wasn't here on Friday either, rarely is. His mother lets him stay home. He has her rapped around his finger. She is to passive with him and his brother.  * We got a new student a couple days ago. She is very much like another student that we have had for three years. That is not good, er, ... it is challenging, the behaviors she presents. A sixteen year old girl with a five year old mentality. She is very vocal, and has poor boundaries with peers...gets into others business frequently.  Gotta go... taking thursday off,...helping to prevent burn out moment by moment.
