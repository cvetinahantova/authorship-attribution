Well I finally watched Fahrenheit 9/11 last night. I think it was over-hyped but it was an excellent documentary. I think the part that caught my attention more than anything was the contracts that  urlLink  Halliburton  were awarded for oil production, pipelines and such. It's unbelieveable the amount of money they will make off of this.  I'm not going to go on too much about the movie other than I highly recommend it to people, so that they can start to ask the questions that need to be asked. I am not a big fan of the U.S. but Mr. Moore is someone I respect, even though he's extremely biased in his opinions he backs them up and starts the debate.   I have also recently read the  urlLink  Al Franken  Al Frankin book,  urlLink  Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them . This is one of the funnier books I have read in a long time and I highly recommend it. If you liked that one you'll really like,  urlLink  Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot  another very funny book.  Well I have been procrastinating in my work out schedule for the last few weeks, and I really need to get back into it. Oh, do I need some will power. I've stopped drinking coffee, ordering out for food, and I now make lunches for work. Let's hope I can get off my bum to start working out more, hehe.  The girls are having a great summer, they've had freinds over almost every day, or have been out at friends houses. They are in the pool whether it rains or pours and have loved it. So it makes me happy.  WHERE IS THE SUN!!!! The rain and overcast skies are just depressing.  RLB
