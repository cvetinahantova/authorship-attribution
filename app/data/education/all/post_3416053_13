Why should we expect that giving automatic weapons to 19 and 20 year old kids and sending them 3000 miles from home would result in good decision-making?  Kids don't have the sense to moderate their own behavior anymore and require a grown-up to do it for them.  Since there seems to be a lack of grown-ups involved with the Iraq expedition it doesn't seem very surprising.  It's amazing what kids can get up to in a school when they escape direct supervision, it's no surprise what they do as part of an occupation force half a world away in the same circumstances.  Half the problems with the world seems to be that there aren't enough grown-ups or people who want to be grown-ups.  Too many people want to be kids forever.  The result is absentee fathers, skipped child support, runaway debt, SUV's, the election of politicians who refuse to tell the truth or face unpleasant truths, silly law suits, runaway malpractice insurance, oldsters dressing like youngsters, etc., etc., blah, blah, blah, ad infinitum.
