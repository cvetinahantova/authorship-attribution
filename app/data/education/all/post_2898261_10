Sitting here alone in my corner of the world Watching each day, this life I lead be told My mind wanders all these different paths Childhood memories, trauma, happiness, and death  As an adoloscent, you were my hero  Always there to rescue me from all my sorrows The years past by and I matured As always, there you were, leaving me feeling secure I ventured out on my own thinking I was mature, Knowing you would still be there to reassure Now here I am, all alone, Wishing that I could have you home I replay every minute of that day in my mind Hoping and wishing for answers I may find My corner gets smaller every day The walls keep closing in, making me afraid Those I ran to have all gone to hide, You are gone, my hero has died Leaving me here with all this pain and sorrow inside
