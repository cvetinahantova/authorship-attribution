Today is the last day of class.  All I have to do is turn in my project folder, and I'm done.  Yes!!!!!!!!!!!  I've spent some time burning copies of my work to cd's so I can use them at home.  I'm in the computer lab waiting for my instructor to arrive.  Life, is good. Mom had a flat tire and didn't even realize.  She drove home on a flat.  I worked late last night (didn't get off until 2:00 AM).  I didn't go to sleep until like 3:30 AM.  I got up around 11:00 this morning, so I could put gas in my car, and take care of biz, before I stopped by my class.  Now all I have to do is go to work.  LOL.  That's later today.  I hope to write more, now that I have some free time.  LOL
