If you can't imagine filling up all that iPod disc space with 10,000 mp3 music files, try cramming some scripture in the little gadget, too. Here are a couple of free Bibles (King James Version) in mp3 format for your iPod:      urlLink ActiveVR's iPod Bible     urlLink BiblePod 1.0    I'm so tragically unhip that I don't own an iPod -- just a tiny Rio Nitrus, which holds some 350 tunes and more than meets my portable audio needs -- so I can't take advantage of either product. But I know many of my readers are much cooler than I.
