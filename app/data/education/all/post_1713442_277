urlLink Open Directory - Society: History: By Time Period: Ancient: Rome: People: Roman Emperors  I have created a new category for Roman Emperors at the Open Directory Project.  I have made subcats for about 18 emperors with the intent of adding categories for another 30.  It is amazing how many sites are out there for even minor rulers like  urlLink Galba  or  urlLink Otho . Anyway, I hope this librarian has made it easier to find good sites on Roman Emperors on the Web.
