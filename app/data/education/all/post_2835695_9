I've learned a lot from the article by Amy Klein. Here's the digest of it. You can prevent sicknesses by reducing your exposure to germs. Follow these tips for healthier, happier you: 1.Wash those hands! Studies show the best way to avoid sickness is frequent and proper hand washing. Always wash your hands before and after thouching "high-risk" items like doorknob and ATMs. Using lots of soap and water, scrub all surfaces of your hands for at leat 15-20 seconds. And be sure to dry your hand thoroughly after washing! Carry a packet of tissues with you to make sure this is possible. 2.Carry instant sanitizer for times when soap and water arem't available. 3.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your bare hands. Most germs enter the body through these places. 4.Don't shake hands with anyone who's sick. 5.Don't share cups, untensils or even towels. 6.Cover your nose and mouth every time you cough or sneeze-with a tissue, if possible! Also use a tissue to wipe your eyes. Pinkeye is surprisingly common and contagious! Trow tissues away in a closed container. Ask those around you to do the same. 7.Make sure your home germ-free. Dishcloths and kitchen sponges are germist surfaces in the home. But simply microwaving these items for two minutes kills the germs. Sinkdrains, faucet handle and doorknob are also notorious for spreading germs. Disinfect these surfaces often. 8.When possible, use public restrooms with no-touch facilities. When these aren't available, try this trick: After washing your hands, turn off the faucet with a paper towel or tissue. Then use it to open the door before throwing it away.
