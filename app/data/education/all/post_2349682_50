I know I went blog wild today but I can't help it, I found so many poems that I really liked about moms. Mom is the person that I hope I can be like when I get older. She is an amazing woman of God and she has such a heart to minister to people. Her kids in her class love her so much, I hope I can be that kind of teacher. I hope that someday I will be blessed like my mother was in finding the perfect man. Mom shows me what a woman of God and nobility acts and speaks like, through good times and bad. Thanks Mom for showing me how to be a better woman, I love you.
