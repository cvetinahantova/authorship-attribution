So last night I read the Moore article from Dad's copy of Time this week.   One question: what was with the endless comparisons between Moore and  urlLink faux-Aussie Mel Gibson ?  Fahrenheit 9/11 is *not* the Passion of the Christ. Repeat, Fahrenheit 9/11 is not the Passion of the Christ.  Jeez, apparently you can't make a controversial movie anymore without endless comparisons to  urlLink Gibson .
