I so hate smoking, I dont know why, but even if nobody told me not to smoke, I still would never smoke. I guess Im starting to get more conscious about myself, like food and about smoking, experts say that even if you dont smoke, you would still get cancer and other smoking diseases if you inhale smoke from other smokers constantly. Oh well, just a little knowledge to share to you guys. Bye : )
