The first week-long vacation I've had in years was wonderful.  Gabriel & I had a great time at Lake Cumberland.  Leaving the dating scene for a week was useful in gaining perspective that might have eluded me, had I been home to pursue things with David during this time.  He forwarded three funny emails, sent nothing personal, and had about a dozen women on each list of recipients.   Alarm bells!   While I may be jumping to conclusions (which may or may not be better than jumping into bed),  no way  am I going to be part of another harem.  This time, I'm on the lookout.  That said, I'm in the midst of a long, dry spell, and wish like hell I could engage in meaningless sex.  Juan is back on the scene--he phoned for the first time in weeks.  God only knows where this might lead, but the man needs  training  in bed if he's going to be any kind of a long-term prospect.  So, back to the vacation:  I don't want to vacation with strangers anymore.  I don't know what I can say to people I've just met, or their poorly-behaved children.  I'm obviously spoiled by only having spent time with kids I've known for years, because this tribe (4 plus a baby) got on my  last nerve .  It's not that I gave birth to the perfect child, but I know how to cope with Gabriel and Sara's girl Rowan at the lake.  The clogged boat toilet was the  last straw  for me -- at that point, I was over it.  Next year, friends only.  I have spoken.
