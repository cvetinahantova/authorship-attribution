Hotmail  urlLink has upgraded its e-mail account capacity to 250 MBs . That is still 1/4 the amount that  urlLink gmail  offers (also  urlLink Spymac ,  urlLink Walla , and various other outlets offer 1 GB of storage. But lets face it, gmail is from google and google provides the best user experience known to man today).  Along with the more storage, they promise a more better spam filter. Of course you can take that worth as much as anyone has donated to me using the paypal donate thing to the right (and yes I will continue making references to this every day until someone actually ponies up some dinero). Hotmail has, and in my opinion, always will be the leader in spam profits. How else can you explain that so much spam gets past its "filter" and yet it blocks off known newsletters? Take for example that every time I check my e-mail there is a message from "Cindy" with no subject. You would think after reporting this to Hotmail at least a dozen times, they would figure out this is spam. Nope, still get it at least three times a week.   So I must ask you, can anyone explain why this occurs without saying Microsoft (the owner of Hotmail) makes money from the spam? Yeah, I did not think so.
