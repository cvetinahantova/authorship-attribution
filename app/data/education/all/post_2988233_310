Well, Will has joined the ranks of sick and pukey.   He hasn't actually thrown up, which is a blessing.  But he is running a high temp and has one of those "make you cry" headaches.   Noah is doing much better.  His temp is actually staying below 102, and he hasn't had any more hallucinations.  I am waiting for his regular peditrician to call.  I am thinking he may have had a seizure, instead of a hallucination.  He doesn't remember a thing about it.  In fact, he looked at me like I was a totally idiot when I mentioned it to him.  Now I am just waiting for all the others to come down with it.  Tommy  thinks he is getting it.  That just leaves me, TJ and Casey.  The biggest babies of the bunch.  TJ and Casey that is, not me.   It is well know that the older babies are, the more baby like they get.  Will is by far, the whiny-est of the sick so far.  He is the one that wants mommy to pet him and make it all better with hugs and kisses.  Jamie just lay there all day long, watching cartoons, only calling me every once in awhile.   I guess they are just preparing to turn into good, old fashioned men that think they are dying when they catch a cold.
