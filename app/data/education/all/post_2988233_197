I just heard from Renee's mom, and evidently, Savannah is in a coma.  She has been admitted to the hospital, but is still in the ER because they don't have a room for her yet.    Renee tried to call me about an hour ago, but I was at the VA with my dad, getting his CAT scan done.  I'm trying to get ahold of her now.  I will post more when I know it.
