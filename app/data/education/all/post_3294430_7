i felt very foreign with my shinai. must be the fact that i've not picked it up since sunday. read about a blog by a guy whose main goal is to do 1000 suburi every two days for a week. maybe i should try that. training was ok tiring but manageble. we practised men cuts with partners "motodachi" no "shidachi" as we are all beginners. will need to practise my kihon to perfect my shomenuchi jogeburi.
