It's been a hectic week!  We've just finished VBS at our congregation (which I was in charge of) -- we had almost 60 kids the last two evenings.  Anyway, back to blogging.  The  Tennessean  (Nashville's daily newpaper) contains an  urlLink article  on this weekend's festivities at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, celebrating the 200th anniversary of the signing of the "Last Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery" in 1804.  Also mentioned is the long-awaited debut of the   urlLink Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement  .
