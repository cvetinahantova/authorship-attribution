I was waiting for Elena outside the locker rooms today at the end of school, and I realised how bored I was. Everything is still the same as it was when I came to school; people have the same arguments, the same problems, they hate the same teachers; and no matter how many new buildings they build, that place will always, always be the same. And it's boring! I can see cycles being repeated over and over again in all the years, and I can see people in my year who've never changed. And don't even get me started on this town! Full of fucking nutters, teenage mothers and townies- nothing original and certainly nothing new. This school, this place will always hold happy memories and I will, of course, treasure the friends I've made, but right now I can't wait to get to university.  Ceff x   We gotta get out of this place...
