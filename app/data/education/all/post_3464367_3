One of my mentors (Fred Williams) who graduated from my alma mater, Morris Brown College in Atlanta, GA, also one the first blacks to receive his MBA from Harvard told me these words "Don't let ANYONE break your spirits".  I always remembered these words, but I always thought my mentor was referring to the ANYONES on the job.  You know that boss that is always harassing you or that jealous co-worker who makes several attempts to stab you in the back.    It wasn't until the last few years of my life did I realize the word "ANYONE" did in fact mean anyone.  It could mean a relative or a close friend.  It could mean your child or parent who may have done something to hurt you. It could even mean those church folks/minister who claim to be holier than thou.  Or it can be that special someone you thought was a soul mate and you so unselfishly gave your heart to in the past.   I was guilty of letting that anyone break my spirits, ceasing my hope, and taking away my joy for today.  I am the one that determines my fate which also includes my happiness.  If I don't like what is going on in my life today, I can change it.  It may not be easy or it may not happen over night, but I can change my own life and my current situations.  It just takes a little faith, a little initiative on my part, and of course a little hope.  He has not forsaken you and he surely has not forsaken me. Keep smiling even if the world thinks it is checkmate.  They are a liar! The  urlLink King has another move !  :)
