Had a very good time at Spring Harvest over Easter.  H and I were working in Evolution (17+).  And had a lot of fun pretending to be artists again.  On Good Friday we did a series of installations on the Stations of the Cross that worked very well.  Unfortunately I forgot to take any photos but will recycle the ideas again I'm sure.  We were with some great guys from a lot of different Churches and Organisations and it was really cool to see how everything pulled together and gelled.   H. even mamaged to launch her celebrity career by a (brief) appearence on songs of praise.  While we were there we saw a bit of Andy Hunter's gig.  He has an excellent album called Exodus out which covers a wide range of dance styles.  His set was part club, part gig and part alt worship event but has got me thinking about the DJ led worship a bit.  Previously I've seen it as an ambient background to do something over (like prayer stations, liturgy or little rituals) but he really led worship by combining the roles of DJ and MC.  Werenï¿½t many there, but it was excellent and I had a lot of fun dancing.
