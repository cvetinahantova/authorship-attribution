June 18th is my last day at ASD.  Tomorrow is Lauren's last day.  Because I will soon lose my car buddy, I decided to go buy gift certificates to the Outback last night as a thank you for the staff I am working with rather than wait and take the drive alone.  Don't worry, MapQuest screwed me again.  We got so lost.  I mean, lost to the point where I called Shane and said, where are we and how the hell do we get where we need to go??  I told him we were going to the Outback, which was weird, because the reason we were going was to buy him a gift certificate!  Good thing he doesn't know Lauren, he would know something was up when a vegetarian wanted to go to the Outback!  Yea, so the Outback is really like 15 minutes away, but we got lost going both to and fro.  Damn Meridon!  We ended up there before we called Shane, he said "you are almost at my house!"  So, we went to buy the certificates and ate dinner at Ruby Tuesdays.  Don't worry, because on the way back, we got lost again.  ALl of a sudden we see CVS, the same one that we had seen 20 minutes ago!  We arrived back at ASD around 6:30.  We were suppossed to meet Michael at 6:00 to help interpret phone calls for him.  (Micheal signs, I interpret to English, Lauren interprets to French)  But, since we were lost, and late, there was not enough time to call, so we will call tonight.  After arriving home from Meridon (damn Meridon!!) we decided to go to the mall and buy cards.  After that we went back to the A-Wing and secided for every minute we spend there days are taken off our lives.  So we went to Friendly's.  I am going to miss Lauren when she goes.  I am really enjoying my time here at ASD.  Even if I am overtired, overworked, and will I ever see a paycheck??!!  :)
