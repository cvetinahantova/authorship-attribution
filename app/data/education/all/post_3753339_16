Ugh, what a disaster.  The wheels came off this week--Margot's return visit was a convenient excuse for me to do nothing.  I only exercised one day this week, and that was Sunday.  I ate poorly multiple times during the week, particularly the last two days where I sat and ate and drank Coke.  I need to turn to water instead of Coke, and I need to go get myself something to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings (all I have here are salty foods, and that's just not cutting it at all--I just eat and eat and eat, feeling unsatisfied all the while).  I'm turning to food and its preparation out of boredom and a desire to avoid work, I believe, as the bad eating and continual stuffing of my face did not begin until Margot left and I really sat down to make myself work on my dissertation.  In order to prevent such a disastrous repeat, I need to a)drink water, or even juice, instead of Cokes, b)make myself go out--either morning or evening, it is my choice, but I must do it, c)next time I go shopping come up with some sort of snack or "entertainment" for myself when I'm working (gum, mints, etc).  I need to just pick up again this coming week, and not let myself fall into old bad habits. 36/45
