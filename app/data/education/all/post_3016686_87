Bjork is not using musicians on her CD, but she IS using a human beatbox.  Justine Timberod must be crushed that he was not asked to assume that role. Anyhoo, here is the artsy fartsy sounding tracklisting:  1. Pleasure Is All Mine  2. Show Me Forgiveness  3. Where Is the Line?  4. Vokuro  5. Oll Birtan  6. Who Is It (Carry My Joy on the Left, Carry My Pain on the Right)  7. Submarine  8. Desired Constellation  9. Oceania  10. Sonnets/Unrealities XI  11. Piano II  12. Mouths Cradle  13. Wednesday (Midvikudags)  14. Triumph of a Heart
