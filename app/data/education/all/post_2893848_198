Alienated from my Fandom    urlLink Bambino's Curse  links to an  urlLink interesting discussion  by Glenn Stout on the uniqueness of Red Sox failure.  BC's own choice of quotation is telling, and being as I'm totally copping his post as it is:   I really think fans of most teams, in most sports, can probably recite their own unique litany of failure and pain -- Red Sox fans aren’t that special. What is unique is that since 1986 that precise emotional vibe has been exploited and marketed to make money. And too many Sox fans (and way, way too many casual fans here and elsewhere, and an absolutely obscene number of no-nothing broadcasters) have gobbled it up because it goes down quick and easy and seems to explain everything. It’s instant Red Sox history, antiseptic, without having to deal with the real nasty stuff, like racism and incompetence.   But at this point it’s too late, almost -- a kind of historic expectation of loss has permeated both the fans and the organization, a willing desire to believe in the worst just so you can feel part of something larger. Even new ownership is affected. When they bought the club they were essentially ignorant of club history, apart from the "curse" nonsense. And any psychologist will tell you that negative thoughts can lead to negative consequences, so in a sense it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy -- it flows back and forth between fans and media and by osmosis even reaches the players, who are usually so narcissistic they aren’t affected by anything.
