I just have to wonder what possesed me to come see my parents for the entire month of July.  I am at the point that I don't know if I want to come back here next summer at all.  I'm thinking of working next summer just so I don't have to.  My mom's kids are a mess.  Well, not the youngest, Nick's a good kid.  Chris I just want to disown.  She's been a total bitch, worse now that she 18, but acts twelve.  I'm just tired of all the drama.  What's the point anyway?  In Sept. she's planning on moving to the same apartment complex as me.  I'll bet five bucks she's knocked up before Christmas.  I'm just sick of all the bullshit.  Well, one more week here and then we're headed to Wy to see my older sister.  The I have to take the little one back to her dad's and a couple of more weeks until work starts up again.   One last comment:  My dad has got to learn that his brats aren't going to straighten up if he doesn't follow thru with mom's threats.
