The final two bodies from the helicopter that crashed near Bario have now been found.  With such a community air is the predominant form of transport, and whilst it is taken as routine, events like this are never far away.  As well as the crash of a helicopter just after it left Bario mid-July last year, there is a memorial to a plane crash next to Bario's old runway, and several people now alive only just survived a crash in a fixed-wing aircraft that was fatal for many others a few years back.  As an outsider it is easy to bemoan the logging tracks that get ever closer to Bario, but the majority of the villagers would like road access.  Seven hour trips on muddy roads that can only be made by 4WDs may not be safer than a flight, but it is an alternative.  The  urlLink Department of Transport  is preparing a new website which should allow you to  urlLink plan a route between any two places in the UK  (also in  urlLink Welsh ).  It isn't fully operational yet, but will hopefully be useful when it is finished.
