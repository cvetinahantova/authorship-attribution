Alright... I spent more time than I wanted on this site update, but at least it's done.  I removed the educational links that didn't work (adding some jazzy buttons I might add), updated the quote (which is quite brilliant) and put a link to this blog on the main page.  I did a few other things, but you probably wouldn't notice.  I also put all of my old Jars on my blog so you can browse through the archives without as much hassle as you were getting before.  Hopefully you enjoy it, because it's so much easier to update.  This Christmas break, I'd like to get things up and running with a new look and feel to the website.  I mean really, how many times can you look at pictures I designed when I was 16?
