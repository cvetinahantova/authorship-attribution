urlLink Spanish for Spanish Speakers: Developing Dual Language Proficiency. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Peyton, Joy Kreeft, Lewelling, Vickie W., and Winke, Paula.  It looks at how educators can help native Spanish speakers to be good at both Spanish and English.  From the ERIC Digest:  The increasing number of students who enter U.S. schools from homes where languages other than English are spoken, and the recognition that proficiency in non-English languages is a valuable national resource, have generated interest in the field of heritage language instruction. A heritage language student is "a language student who is raised in a home where a non-English language is spoken, who speaks or at least understands the language, and who is to some degree bilingual in that language and in English" (Valdes, 2001, p. 38).   The fastest growing heritage language population in the United States is Spanish-speaking immigrants and Americans of Hispanic descent whose families came from Central America, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South America. The inclusion of Spanish-speaking students in foreign language classes places additional demands on teachers, who may be prepared to teach only speakers of English. As a result, a growing number of secondary schools, colleges, and universities in states with large Hispanic populations offer separate Spanish for Native Speakers (SNS) courses or programs tailored to the needs of these students.
