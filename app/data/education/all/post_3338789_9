I've been sorta busy. Sorry.  :)  My class's last meeting is tomorrow (hooray!) and I have been working on my paper among other things.  We painted the living room and I got some really nice frames for the pictures I had up there so look soon for some pictures of the livingroom!  We also got our tables in. Finally!    In other news... uhm...there is none! That I can think of... Hm. Our birthdays went well, got money toward our landscaping...and this afternoon...our NEIGHBOR..mowed our WEEDS. Swear to goodness. There he was, on his riding lawn mower, going to town in our back yard.  He was checking for low spots because he had extra fill dirt or something. I dunno. Either way, he did our whole yard...so now we have a weed lawn! yay! :)    end of story. :) I'm spent. :)
