Well, Luke made it through another tour! From the sounds of it, this one went much better than last year's. (Of course, that doesn't take much.) It's very nice having him back. He's mowed the lawn for me. He's even reformatted my computer, which is very exciting for me. I'm still planning on replacing it fairly soon (any recommendations on systems, people?), but it's needed some work for a while. He even opened and closed the car doors for me and Chanda when we went out over the weekend. He'd never done that before. It was kind of nice. It's nice just to have someone there, but when he's a gentleman and all that, it's even better! :o) So, the house is a little messy. That's one of the things that hit me first--things weren't where I left them and other things just showed up out of nowhere and stayed where I wouldn't have left them. But he mentioned cleaning this afternoon, and, really, it doesn't bother me that much . . . yet.  I'm just so happy he's home!!
