Wow...what a blast I had.  I only wish every kid could go through what I went through and just have nonstop fun for one whole week.  Anyways, I am not at all curious how Mishawaka was while I was gone but I am curious how u all were.  I am seeing Dodgeball today since that is one of the few things I constantly thought about at camp.  You're all invited...phone calls are coming.  I am a little tired but not too much.  The bus was nice but I still was crammed like a sardine and I am still recovering.  Anyways, later.
