My first evening in Prague was spent in the  urlLink Smetana Concert Hall  listening to Mozart's  Requiem . What a beautiful piece of music- quite otherworldly  and moving from start to finish. That first night kind of set the mood for the next two days of my trip as I wandered around Prague with the Requiem still in my head staring up at old gothic cathedrals. Unfortunately, the Czech Republic is now about 40% atheist...horrible what years of communism can do.    Dies irae, dies illa Solvet saeclum in favilla, Teste David cum Sibylla.  Quantus tremor est futurus Quando judex est venturus Cuncta stricte discussurus.     Day of wrath, that day Will dissolve the earth in ashes As David and the Sibyl bear witness.  What dread there will be When the Judge shall come To judge all things strictly.
