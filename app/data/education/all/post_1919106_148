urlLink What's been keeping me busy    Well, apart from the cold. Which is doing much better, thank you for asking. But that's normal - when I have a cold then I feel the worst of it in the morning when I wake up and my throat feels as if I had swallowed a cheese grater.  As for keeping me busy, there's always work. The presentation  urlLink on Tuesday . The presentation on  urlLink Tuesday after that . The  urlLink project  for the same class that those two presentations are for. The  urlLink paper  for the other class. The  urlLink other   urlLink two  papers for the other class.  Of course I always find  urlLink more   urlLink entertaining  things to look at.
