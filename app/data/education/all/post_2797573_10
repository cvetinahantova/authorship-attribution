So many ups and downs in my life.  I took the two older kids out job hunting on Monday.  Jacob filled out 4 applications.  Sarah only filled out 1, but it was for the pet store.  She would love to work there!  She may try vet offices, too.  Jacob hasn't been feeling real well this week, so that may affect his search.  We got bad news that we can't qualify for a parent loan for his education.  I knew our credit was bad, but I had hoped we could swing it for him.  We are reevaluating his education goals.  He may have to commute for the time being and work on the weekends.  I hope it works.  I asked my brother to cosign a student loan, but he declined.  I'm a little frustrated because I had done so much for him when he was growing up.  I don't ask for favors very often, so had hoped he might be willing to help out.  He wouldn't have had to pay anything because I have every intention of paying it myself.  I guess our best course of action is to get relief from our bankruptcy.  I mailed out the information the lawyer requested and hope she can make things happen.  If that works out, then we can afford to pay tuition and even get him a usable car.  He will still need to work to pay his personal expenses, but that would be ok.  Sean is also looking for a different job.  He is interviewing at a couple of places today.  I'm a little nervous about his leaving CB because it is a known quantity.  I like the company for the most part, but he's been under a lot of pressure lately.  I would only want him to change if it means a definite improvement in finances and/or work conditions.  The kids have been driving me crazy!  They just sit around the house.  It would help if they had jobs.  I almost feel like trying to get a job just to get out of the house myself.  I am looking forward to school starting.  I'm anxious to set up my classroom.  I have a lot of ideas and am looking forward to trying them out.  This is a hard summer, but I think things will get better.
