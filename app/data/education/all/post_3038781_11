My pre-coffee thoughts:  I think there is probably a metaphysical, logical, and odd argument that old nick/lucifer needs an anti-depressent or psychological care.     Here's the argument:      All things created by God are in a state of being during their lifetime.  Lucifer was created by God.   ----------------------------    Lucifer is in a state of being during his lifetime.     Lucifer is in a state of being during his lifetime.  All entities in a state of being are beings.  ----------------------------------   Lucifer is a being.      Lucifer is a being that has turned away from God [bible].  All beings that turn away from God are in despair. [ soren kirkegaard].  ------------------------------    Lucifer is in despair.      Lucifer's state of dispair is eternal [i.e. chronic] [soren kirkegaard].  Chronic despair/depression requires treatment. [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/                     publicat/depression.cfm]  -------------------------------    Lucifer requires treatment.       Lucifer's state of despair/depression is severe. [soren kirkegaard]  Severe cases of despair/depression should be prescribed mixed regimines of psychotherapy and drug treatment. http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ publicat                                                      /depression.cfm#ptdep5  ----------------------------------    Lucifer's state of despair/depression should be prescribed mixed regimines of psychotherapy and drug treatment.     So... any doc ready to take on that case?    Wonder what my post-coffee thoughts will be.
