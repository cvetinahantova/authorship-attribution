Subject: Quote of the month...   ?"Back in 2000 a Republican friend warned me that if I ?voted for Al Gore and he won, the stock market would ?tank, we'd lose millions of jobs, and our military ?would be totally overstretched. You know what? I did ?vote for Gore, he did win, and I'll be damned if all ?those things didn't come true!" ? -- James Carville
