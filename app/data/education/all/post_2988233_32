Oh I wanted to explain why I chose the baground and template I did.  I love the flower to the left.  It just really suits my mood most of the time.  Reminds me of life.  It is beautiful, fragile, and special.  We have to make the most of it with what God trusts us with.  It may not be what we think he should give us, but he knows us better than we ourselves do.  I have to remind my self of that a lot these days.
