joy -- 8 days left of class, and somehow all my work seems to have avalanched on me... the numbers on the countdown in the margin are going down, but slowly... accomplishments of the day?  1 analysis problem, 4.5 algebra problems, and 23 christmas cards written.  man... sad thing is i did the 23 christmas cards in just a small fraction of the time everything else took... patience... that's the word of the week... i don't think i'm gonna have much left in a few days, but i'll try =P  the quote of the week: "i'd rather die of exhaustion than boredom"... true indeed... but it would be nice if the exhaustion was a little more self directed than insanely long homework assignments... maaaan...  ok, no more complaining... sleep time.. stay tuned to watch and see me spontaneously explode and/or go crazy by friday! =P
