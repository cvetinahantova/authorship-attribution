This song has been going in and out of my head fo the last few days. I think it’s freash in my head because I am feeling this way.                          WHEN THE MUSIC FADES (THE HEART OF WORSHIP)   When the music fades, all is stripped away, And I simply come; Longing just to bring something that's of worth That will bless your heart,                                                   (bridge)  I'll bring you more than a song, For a song in itself Is not what you have required. You search much deeper within Though the way things appear, You're looking into my heart                                                     (chorus)  I'm coming back to the heart of worship, And it's all about you, All about you Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it, When it's all about you, All about you, Jesus.   King of endless worth, no one could express How much you deserve. Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is yours, Every single breath                                           (now go to the bridge)
