School Holiday coming up, so I thought it would be nice for my babies to see their grandmother (and nice for me to have the house to myself...).  Not the easiest thing to arrange, given that we only communicate by text message, but I asked her anyway - 'U wnt c kds 4 hols?'  And she says yes, she will for a few days, despite current illnesses, appointments, and general malaise, if it will help me out.  That is so not the point!  I just thought it would be nice, for her, as she often complains that she has missed so much of their growing up, and that she is not close to them.  But that would amount to her wanting something, which is unacceptable, as oppose to me needing something, which she can deal with.  Some are born grandmothers, it appears, and some have grandchildren thrust upon them.
