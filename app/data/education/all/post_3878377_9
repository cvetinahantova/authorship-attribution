I started my day doing my homework in Pastoral Psychology, well student life, I have to do what I am supposed to do. I did my laundry afterwards, for me its a ritual that gets rid of daily stress. Jorge visited me early this morning with his newspaper. Oh boy! he never realize how much he surprises me with his little and unpredictable ways! He went home and I think he is sleeping now...soon he will be suffering from over sleeping, over eating and over a well-rounded tummy! That's why he wanted to go and work now..that which will give sense to his daily living.  And I'll do my own stuff here...study and work while waiting for him. After all, life is about waiting! We wait for seasons to change, fruits to ripe, people to grow, sun to set and shine, tide to become high or low, moon to wax or wane, we wait..falling in line even in the ordinary routine of our life, we wait for loved ones to come home in our arms.  Our love story then becomes a mantra of waiting. For me, it shares a kind of wisdom par excellence! For what are the virtues that develop in the person when they learn to wait, to harvest fruits in the right time, to linger on time and learn patience...to make the heart grow ponder and live? Everyone who knows how to WAIT knows the virtue and wisdom behind it!Mahal ko ano na naman ba tong pinag-sasabi ko? Minsan naniniwala na talaga ako sayo na baka mag-end up akong baliw dito sa mga kabaliwan ng buhay ang mga pinag-gagawa at sinasabi ko. Anyway, yun this is my reflection, I think therefore I do.      Note: Sa mahal ko, araw-araw kong sasabihin sayo na mahal na mahal kita. Maraming salamat sa lahat ng ibinahagi mo sakin---panahon, pagmamahal, buhay at higit sa lahat yung kabuuan ng pagka-TAO mo. I love you mahal ko.         JO
