So after it's all over, will people remember me?  Will I be remembered for something other than being someone's daughter, cousin, teacher, neice?  One of the things that really sunk in when my uncle passed was how, despite everything, he was luckier than many other people because he had experienced true, undying love.  A lot of people have love in their lifetimes, but not everyone gets that "union-of-two-souls" kind of love.  And I know that sounds existential but that's how I see it.  Now I'm cooking some chicken alfredo...I hope.  It depends on what it comes out as--LOL---Okay, so the alfredo was great.  Now I'm starting to get sleepy.  One thing I have yet to figure out is why people say they're gonna call and don't?  I mean, if you think you might or might not call, then just don't say anything at all.  I think maybe I put too much faith in people. Then again, maybe I need to calm the heck down and stop assuming so doggone much:)   Well, gonna turn in now.
