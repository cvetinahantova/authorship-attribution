Whatever Carla Mindel has for breakfast, I want some. The woman has boundless energy. She's a teaching machine. Today she pulled her usual 'you should have done this, and written that, and read these, and be well on your way to completing that by now' routine, and as usual left me pissing in my pants and crying for mercy. I'm sure there's a possibility that I could do all of the above within the aforementioned timeframe if I was prepared to forego all earthly pleasures, including sleep. Short of that, I think I might need to employ staff. Anyone volunteering? Thought not.   Massive thunderstorm tonight in the London area. Was impressively flashy and bangy and arrived at the opportune moment to prevent me from going for a run. The rest of the night has slipped by in eel-like fashion without my having achieved half of what I was supposed to. Was feeling quite motivated this afternoon. I think that feeling got swept away on the cold front, along with the unseasonal April sunshine.  My blog is becoming quite a gloom-fest. Tomorrow am instituting Positivity Day. Will smile and laugh in non-bitter/cynical/post-ironic fashion and will spread joy and hope among PGCE cohort. Will come home and produce 3 generic schemes of work while simultaneously constructing portfolio for interview. Will go to bed tired but happy and fulfilled. No, really. Just you wait and see.
