Time, it moves onward tick-tocking like a heartbeat. Stop for this moment, Let me see your eyes, see the passion and the depth. Let me touch your face. Moments move forward like sand through the hourglass. Stop and let me breathe. Let me bask in warmth Let me taste the memory: then, now, and again. Each moment is dear for moments make a lifetime and lifetimes shall pass. Here we stand as one You are my friend, my love, and I, your love, your friend.
