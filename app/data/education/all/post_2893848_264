A heads up- A and I are in the process of moving and the process isn't exactly blog-friendly.  We'll be in Chicago on Saturday (help us move, please) but for the next week or so, I'll be posting much less.  Maybe Scott could tear himself from the poems now and then and pick up the slack.  If anyone needs my new contact info, email or call.
