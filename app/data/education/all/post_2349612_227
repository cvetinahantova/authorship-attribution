so i have a part time job for summer now... i guess it is partly who you know... my boss from last summer said i could work long distance for june for the same pay rate i made last summer for somewhere around 10-15 hours per week.  it's not full time, but it's something, ya know?  and for me only being in one place for 4 weeks of the summer, i don't know how much more i'd find anyhow.  so yay for that.  the end.
