The sky seems to be falling over the issue of gay marriages at  urlLink NRO's The Corner .  I particularly like this comment by John Derbyshire:   "Can't someone do a citizen's arrest of these law-breaking registrars in San Francisco?  Where on earth are the state authorities?  Where is the Governor?"   Quick Derb, let loose the police dogs and turn on the firehoses before another pair of lesbians in a 50-year relationship gets a civil marriage!  If we let this happen, what's next?  Blacks sitting in at lunch counters?  If the Derb and other NRO'ers would stop hyperventilating for a moment and listen to the stories of those couples getting married in SF, they would realize that these people aren't trying to destroy marriage.  In fact, they hold marriage in great regard, so great that they want what every heterosexual couple can have--legal recognition of their love and commitment to one another.  I was particularly struck by one recently married man intereviewed on NPR who said, "This is what my parents  did."  It didn't sound to me like he wanted to destroy what his parents did, but rather that he wanted to be just as equal and just as normal as his parents.  If people can't see this, then they are blinded by their own bigotry.
