hey,  well things are going good here.  i'm a little tired because i couldn't go  to sleep last night.  anyway... long day of classes today too.  also i  learned that no matter how prepared i think i am a class can still go to  shit.  i ended up just making grade 1 write words all day.  i think they  were bored.  actually i know they were bored because they asked to clean the  room. ha.  well gotta run i have people over.  emma, from england and aurora  from oregon are over to play cards.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.
