So I want to be happy, but I don't know how to be. There is no way of knowing with confidence except if God were to tell me. Time is short and this does seem to be the best option. I find myself hoping that God does exist... Hmmm. God is possible and I want him to exist so I can achieve my ultimate goal of being happy in life. Well, does a God exist? Even if so, God would need to be willing to listen to me and communicate with me. Can I know whether this is the case? No again. Uncertainty. Nevertheless, my quest is important enough to continue even if there is uncertainty.
