urlLink Finding Mathematics Teachers. ERIC Digest.  This EROC Digest is by Linda A. Milbourne.  From the ERIC Digest:  Student performance in mathematics has been a matter of national concern for many years, and formal efforts to reform mathematics education has led to the development of national content standards (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM),1989) and an update of those standards. (NCTM,2000). U.S. Governors identified mathematics achievement as a national priority by setting a goal that "By the year 2000, United States students will be first in the world in mathematics...achievement" (Report of the National Education Goals Panel, 1989). International comparisons of mathematics achievement, however, indicate that this has not occurred (National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, 2000).  The good news is that we know how to improve the mathematics performance of students. Research shows that there is a connection between student achievement in mathematics and both the structure of the curriculum and the content of textbooks (Schmidt, et al, 2001), so ongoing development and implementation of content standard should ultimately lead to a desired increase in achievement. Research also indicates a positive relationship between teacher preparation and student achievement (Fetler, 2001; Darling-Hammond, 2000). Indeed, the research on teacher preparation in mathematics and science has led to very specific and practical guidelines for improving teacher education programs (Committee on Science and Mathematics Teacher Preparation, 2001).  The bad news is the shortage of qualified teachers in mathematics classrooms. Though the number of high school mathematics teachers in U. S. public schools increased by 22,000 between 1990 and 2000 to a total of 134,000, the percentage of teachers who are assigned to teach high school mathematics classes who are certified to teach mathematics has decreased from 90% in 1990 to 86% in 2000. The situation is worse in middle schools. The number of middle school mathematics teachers has increased by 44,000 since 1994 to a total of 124,000 in 2000, but of teachers assigned to teach middle school mathematics in 2000, only 66% were certified to do so. Among the 50 states, only 11 have over 80% of their middle school mathematics teachers certified in mathematics (Blank & Langesen, 2001). The shortages for high-minority and low-income schools are particularly distressing. In schools with over 50% minority enrollment in grades 7-12, 24% of mathematics teachers teach out-of-field. For high-poverty schools where 60% or more of the students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch programs, 31% of mathematics teachers have neither an undergraduate or graduate major or minor in mathematics (Clewell & Forcier, 2001). Though state certification standards vary widely and some states do have higher percentages of their teachers certified to teach mathematics, the supply of qualified mathematics teachers remains inadequate nationwide. Indeed, 95% of urban school districts nationwide report an immediate need for high school mathematics teachers (Council of Great City Schools, 2000). The need to find qualified mathematics teachers for the nation's schools is critical.  Shortages in qualified mathematics teachers led the "Glenn Commission" (National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, 2000) to call for a significant increase in teachers as one of its three primary goals (p. 29). To achieve this goal, actions are needed both to identify exemplary teacher preparation models that can be widely replicated, and to attract larger numbers of qualified individuals into teaching mathematics.
