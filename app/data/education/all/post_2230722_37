The  urlLink Human Rights Campaign  has announced that a vote will take place in the Senate in  early July  on the Federal Marriage Amendment to the US Constitution.  The HRC is asking everyone to please contact their Senators today and ask them to oppose this hateful legislation. Visit the  urlLink HRC action center  to easily email your Senators or to find text for a letter.  A little input could make a huge difference in our lives as American citizens.  Personally, I don't think the FMA has much chance of passing, but we cannot be complacent on this issue. We need to send a clear message  NOW  that this politicially-motivated and Religious-Right pandering homphobic piece of legislation is unacceptable and unAmerican.
