The Good:     Martha sees jail time. While I feel sorry for the media circus this became, I was happy to see a reasonable penalty handed out. Lying to federal investigators needs to come with consequences. Regardless of the insider trading issue, this alone is reason to hand out time.     Ken Jennings keeps on rolling. I hope he goes for another month before he's beaten. Anybody that smart should be able to retire, and I hope he makes enough before it's done that he feels he can.      The Bad:     Rosie O'Donnell. Could she be any more annoying right now? It seems like I've seen her giant head more on TV this last week than I have in years. If she isn't spouting the same old nonsense about Bush and Iraq, she's shoving her latest gay diatribe in our faces. Shut up Rosie. You're obnoxious and irrelevant. Go live your life however you choose and stop telling everybody about it. When's the last time you heard somebody soapboxing over their heterosexual lifestyle? Talking about the fact that they're straight every chance they get? You haven't. Neither have I. If I did, I'd tell them to shut up too.      Jay London gets the boot. He was hilarious. Most people just didn't get him. Those of us who did hope to see him more from now on.      The Ugly:     Oprah Winfrey had a show this past week on baby rape, child prostitution, and other heinous sexual situations around the world. I decided to make sure I saw it when I found out it would be on. If you didn't watch it, you should. You should watch every minute and feel every bit of sick rage that these things should inspire. You should then think about Iraq and the fact that Saddam reportedly had state-funded rapists on staff to degrade women at his command. Read about his sick sons' actions while in power. Then try convincingly telling yourself it was a mistake. If you still can, go buy a soul.      That's it for this week.  Back on Monday with movie reviews.
