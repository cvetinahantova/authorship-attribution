I don't have much profound to say today.  I met up with Fenton after work and we ate and then grabbed some beers at the plaza.  It was cool.  Hopefully everything will be finalized tomorrow concerning our trip to Shanghai.  In a rather odd set of events last year Steve met a girl from Shanghai and still has her business card so I'm going to e-mail her and see if she wants to hang out.  She it roughly my age so maybe she'd want to head out for a night on the town with Fountain and I.  I guess we'll see.  I'm ready to get tomorrow over and done with and jump into vacation mode even it is for only 3 or 4 days.  I should be in bed but I'm not.  Yeah really I have nothing good to say.  I'm going to get some sleep, you should too.
