I hated it so much that I can't enter in my own blog. My password seemed so unacceptable.. In any case, I open another blog. I hope this time it won't make my life so difficult. I just came from house (jorge's place)no bath, feeling bad because of bad cough the whole night. I'll take a shower afterwards anyway. I love it to be with my love..to hug him all day and night..so I care less goin to school without takin a bath...hmmm foolish heart.Always tend to do crazy things...
