You could, if you wished, deny that Mister God existed, but then any denial didn't alter the fact taht Mister God was. No, Mister God was, he was the king-pin, the centre, the very heart of things, and this is where it got funny. You see, we had to recognise that He was all these things and that meant that we were at our own centre, not God. God is our centre and yet it is we who acknowledge that He is the centre. That makes us somehow internal to Mister God. This is the curious nature of Mister God, that even while He is at the centre of things He waits outside us and knocks to come in. It is we who open the door. Mister God doesn't break it down and come in, no, He knocks and waits.  Now, it takes a real super kind of God to work that one out, but that's just what He's done. As Anna says, 'That's very funny, that is. It makes me very important, don't it? Fancy Mister God taking second place!'   ~ 'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn
