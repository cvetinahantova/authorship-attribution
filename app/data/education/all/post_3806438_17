I'm stealing a post directly from  urlLink Joe , but you have to check out the  urlLink  Election Projection  for up to date predictions on who will win the presidency.  This site is maintained by a staunch Bush supporter, who manages to be intelligent in spite of that one character flaw.  That was unfair, I take it back.  Despite his leanings, however, the data is unbiased and provides an accurate picture.
