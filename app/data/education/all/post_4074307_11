Dear Sirs,               I sat watching last week's Democratic convention and had to laugh, because I thought I heard Republicans talking with just a few exceptions.    Where were the real Al Gore and Ted Kennedy?    Their speeches were far different than the rants and raves that they have been giving in speeches prior to the Convention.    John Edwards gave an excellent speech, but it was filled with class warfare rhetoric that is not helpful to the countries future.    Finally, John Kerry spoke, and he also gave an excellent speech full of great slogans.    And that's the problem; all I really know about John Kerry is that he hates President Bush and that he wants to raise taxes.    He says he has plans, but won't tell us what they are.    Whenever you question his voting record in the Senate, he says you are questioning his Patriotism.    I don't, I question his policies, because when you hear them I am sure that you will come to only one conclusion in this election, and that is to re-elect President Bush.               Thank you,       Marc Fleischner     (Thank you to John Lyden for his editing skills!)
