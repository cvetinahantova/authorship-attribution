here's the list of recommendations from my last two weeks of (catching up) movie viewing:    urlLink Girl With A Pearl Earring      I love how the director / cinematographer cultivate this sense that -- there are ways of seeing the world -- that are better and worse.  All the good ways of seeing include -- paying attention.   by the time Vermeer finds out / connects with / teaches Grete about cultivating a way-to-see-the-world -- we're right along with him.  And her.  Because of the beautiful filming.   And speaking of beautiful filming:    urlLink Elephant        thanks erik for reminding me to rent this film   By Gus Van Sant -- is a great film.  I'm relieved to be able to say so, because, though i Liked GoodWillHunting -- I didn't think it had the same courageous VISION that  urlLink Drugstore Cowboy  &  urlLink My Own Private Idaho  had.  It's like he has this beautiful way of seeing the broken parts of the world.  That definitely comes out in this Columbine-esque tale.    Both films are slow, but demand patient attention.   I had more, but have to go grade...  Thinking of you (that is, if you're reading, those of you who I'm thinking of...)  peace~
