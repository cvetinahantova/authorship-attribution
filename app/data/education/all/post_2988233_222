The honest to goodness, real life, with animals and everything  urlLink circus  is in town.    Not the big one, but the  urlLink hometown version .  But hey, a circus is a circus right?  My SIL called, and she had an extra ticket.  A mutual friend of ours gave them free tickets, and she had extra.    How do you decide which one of 5 children gets to go to the circus while the others stay home?  It was actually pretty easy.  Noah was the lucky recipient of the free ticket.    The older boys had all been, and could remember going.  Noah had been, but was only 1yr old, so he hadn't a clue of going.  My SIL picked him up, and off they went.  My baby, my little one, off by himself to the circus.  He was nervous, I was nervous.    When he got home, he was telling all about the elephants, the dog that stole the clowns hot dogs, the people who swung up high and fell onto the net, all the horse riders, yeah, we made the right  choice.   the friend is hoping to get more free tickets for later this week.  I hope he does.  My other boys would love it.
