urlLink Information Literacy in an Information Society. ERIC Digest.   This is a nice short essay on why information literacy is important and how educators can help students become more information literate.  From the site:  Information Literacy is the ability to access, evaluate, and use information from a variety of sources. As students prepare for the 21st century, traditional instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics needs to be coupled with practice in communication, critical thinking, and problem solving skills (Costa, 1985).  DEFINITION  An information literate person is one who:  * recognizes that accurate and complete information is the basis for intelligent decision making  * recognizes the need for information  * formulates questions based on information needs  * identifies potential sources of information  * develops successful search strategies  * accesses sources of information including computer-based and other technologies  * evaluates information  * organizes information for practical application  * integrates new information into an existing body of knowledge  * uses information in critical thinking and problem solving (Doyle, 1992)
