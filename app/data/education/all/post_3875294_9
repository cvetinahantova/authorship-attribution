So, yesterday was a nice relaxing short of day.  For lunch I went over to my freind Kristen's house.  She is also my Mary Kay consultant.  We had fun playing around with color.  I found a new lipstick color I liked, and alos ordered a couple needed items.  She said we would have to get together soon for pampering our feet.  Sounds awsome.  She has a very cute baby boy.  He is 4 months old, but my gosh you would think he was at least 6 months if not 7 or 8.  He is the chunkiest little baby ever, but oh so cute.  He has a very nice smile.  Kristen and her husband just started going to a church in town they really like.  John and I may try it sometime soon.  We like the church we have been attending recently, but we are still kinda looking.  Being at the ocean a few days ago was an awsome reminder of what an awsome artist our Lord is.  I mean, he is the artist we all try to imitate in our various artistic ways.  It's so abvious that the universe had to be created, its just so awsomely creative!  Today, I'm getting a second pricing on my needed car repairs, sounds like we might be able to save some money!  Woo hoo!  It's my dad's mechanic, so I better get going over to Tualatin soon.  Mom and Dad have the day off, so they are having me over for lunch and I'm bringing over left over wedding cake (the lady who made our cake, remakes your top for you on your first anniversary - way cool - Im sure it taste a lot more fresher than if we froze the real one from our wedding).
