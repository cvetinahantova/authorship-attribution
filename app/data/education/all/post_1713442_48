urlLink The Smoking Gun  Wow, a site that finds embarrassing quotes and actions done by politicians and celebrities.  For example, Conan the Republican who is running for Governor of California has an 1970s interview from a sex magazine highlighted.  (Don't take it personally Arnold, as a moderate Republican, and someone who likes sex, I would vote for you.)  It also has mug shots for actors and others who have been arrested at one point or another.  I guess I had better never run for public office.  The Smoking Gun would probably find this site and make my life difficult.  (And, The Smoking Gun is also a TV show now too.  Cool!)
