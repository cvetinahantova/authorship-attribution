Hmm..... blog blog blogging.  Here is something I worked on this weekend.  It's called...   Past Midnite  Staying up late With everything to say We laughed as we sipped our drinks Smiling I wanted it to last forever Of course it never can And then, happy turned to sad When you were no where to be found Now I am ... Staying up late With nothing to say The smile has gone  This.... poem.... is because I had an exceptional conversation with a chap, and he asked if I would be around... where in which I said I would, and he didn't ever show.  The problem is.. is that we had great conversations, and I actually feel like I miss talking to him... so.. yeah, that sucks.  Anyways, other than that, things are pretty much the same.  Yawn.
