I know alot of you who read my blog, also read renee's-Pieces of Me-, well her daughter Savannah is in the hospital today, and tonight.  Her ammonia when they checked it this morning was 605.  Normal is around 20-40 depending on which machine and which doctor you talk to.    Savannah has  urlLink Citrillinimia  It is extremely rare.  In fact Savannah was the first child in the state of NC to have it.  Now there are 3.  She is the oldest. Renee and Stan lost twin boys to this disease 6 years ago.  They were 14 and 15 days old.  If not for their deaths, Savannah wouldn't be here today.    As you know, she is very special little girl to me.  So I ask for you to all pray for her.
