............................................................ who ever said that optimism is a virtue? ............................................................  i say yes to too many obligations.  i make too many friends (i love them all, mind you).  i expect to finish work in less time than i do.  i see the spark of beauty in people who haven't muich more than a spark.  does it sound like i'm a good guy?  i'm not.  ask my wife.  living with an optimist is a special kind of hell.  that should be the name of a song, eh?
