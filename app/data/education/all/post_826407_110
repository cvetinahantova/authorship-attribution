Meant to put this up yesterday as part of the [grid blog :: advent] but blogger wouldn't let me log on all day.  Still here it is a day late.  Song of the Wilderness (Advent)  The wilderness and the dry land shall rejoice, The desert shall blossom and burst into song  They shall see the glory of the Lord, the Majesty of our God.  Strengthen the weary hands,  and make firm the feeble knees.  Say to the anxious, 'Be strong, fear not,        your God is coming with judgement, coming with judgement to save you.  Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;  For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;  The ransomed of the Lord shall return with singing, with everlasting joy upon their heads.    Joy and gladness shall be theirs, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.                                    Selected bits of Isaiah 35, from Common Worship.  This is what we seek, this is the ancient promise.  A world of balance, justice and peace.   An Eden restored where the desert and wasteland become oases of life.  A world where God is among us and we are with him.  Its a dangerous dream that's been in our makeup since day one.  How many have died, or killed for their version of a new Zion?  How many sacrifices, how many compromises? How much blood spilt how many tears shed over this dream.  Surely this dream has been bankrupt by toil?  Surely I am naive, deceived or dangerous to still hold on?  I don't believe so.    This was the promise that Christ the GodMan embodied.  It was also a dream that came for him.  It took him to the cross, the grave and then beyond.    And now it has half come, that is not quite there.  And so we go on, frustrated, wounded, tired, disillusioned.  But dreaming.  Will I let it come for me?  Is this truly what I seek?    Or shall I settle for a more mediocre vision.     For more info on [grid blog :: advent ] go  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  or  urlLink here .
