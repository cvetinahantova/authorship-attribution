urlLink When Worlds Collide: Libraries & Writing Centers  Here is a new article at  Academic Exchange Quarterly .  It is a good article which details how libraries can work well with writing centers.  Only the abstract is online but the full article can be found in the Spring 2004 issue which will be out soon.  Abstract:  "Most college campuses have writing centers, where students can get help from professional and peer tutors with their writing skills.  When students need research help, they can get help from librarians. But wouldn’t it be great if writing centers and libraries could  collaborate and combine the benefits of peer tutoring with research assistance? This article presents one collaborative approach to combining a writing center’s peer tutoring program with a library’s research assistance program."
