Saddam Hussein has been captured.  Really, I don't think I was really  for  the war in Iraq at all (I mean, what ever happened to finding Osama and hanging around in Afghanistan?), but I'm a military child through and through, and I think this is a good thing. I found it really strange though that for some man who was willing to stand his ground despite threats of war just willingly gave himself in. He had a gun, but NO shots were fired. I just found that strange.  I seriously seriously hope there is no school tomorrow. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I can't wait till holiday break. Five more days, five more days, five more days....*mutters feverishly*
