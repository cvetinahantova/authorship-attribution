The last few days on my trip to Japan has been raining.  Monday especially since there was the typhoon that was heading towards Hiroshima but missed it and went to Osaka which was where we were that day.  We've gone around so many places both historic and modern.  My favorite thus far had to be Miwajima, you know that torii and all the dears running around looking for people to feed them.  It was totally how I imagined Japan like how you see on the TV, movies and text books.  Despite the mix of rain and humidity, it hasn't stopped my friends and me from going place.
