Well I am back from my weekend in Cincinnati, I hope your weekend went a little better then mine did. But enough about that. I noticed this morning that I did indeed, have a comment posted on the blog in response to my earlier post about the consolidation of power we have witnessed over the past few months. Although the person chose not to leave a name, they sure tried to make me look like a fool, but I quickly responded back. If you care to read, go to last weeks archived posts. There are also a few other posts I've yet to respond to, I'll hit those in a few minutes. Other than that, I'm posting later tonight about the "Executive Forum" that our new officers went to today, and also I will have a list of candidates for the upcoming elections for you, hopefully by tomorrow.
