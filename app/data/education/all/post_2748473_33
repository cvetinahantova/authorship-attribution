People are really dissappointing me lately. I don't know who my true human friends are outside of my family anymore. It's soooo confusing with people and their relationships and dating people and being caught inbetween what is real and just a dream. Feeling second best and being the one to fall back on if original plans don't go through, I just want a place to put a foot on and be steady.
