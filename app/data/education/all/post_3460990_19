Things are definitely better now than last week. Holly is here, and I'm in the process of finishing up some schoolwork so I can spend some time playing in the city.   Next week is the last week of university classes for my program, which means that everything is due all at once. It's crazy, but once it's over, that last week will be a piece of cake!  Starting on Monday, I have a final, a take-home final, a paper, and a group project that all has to be turned in before 4:30 on Thursday. After that, it's just field trips and more instruction on how to instruct.   We'll be graduating from training on August 6, and the ceremony will be on the world-famous Intrepid aircraft carrier. First thing Saturday, August 7, I'm on a plane home.   I'll be in town long enough to get to spend time with anyone who's free. I am so excited to be coming back to Texas!
