Today was my French exam, it was alright, beside the sight passage and the personal questions part. I missed one antonym and two synonyms… my French vocabulary really sucks...:( Anyways, science exam tomorrow, the only that I am really really really worried about...=/ I must go study more science… *sigh*   I have a sudden impulse of typing out lyrics, so here’s the  Lyric of the Day :   The stars will cry the blackest tears tonight  And this is the moment that I live for  I can smell the ocean air  Here I am pouring my heart onto these rooftops  Just a ghost to the world  Thats exactly,  Exactly what I need...   From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem of our dying day...    From  Anthem of Our Dying Day , by  Story of the Year .
