I redid the whole thing again from Maroon5 lyrics to Sarah McLachlan lyrics from her song Fallen…most specifically from the second verse. I still love Maroon5, but this song has been on ‘repeat’ and stuck in my head for a good deal of time now…   "We all begin with good intent, When love was raw and young. We believed that we could change ourselves; The past could be undone. But we carry on our backs a burden Time always reveals -- In the lonely light of morning, In the wound that would not heal, Is the bitter taste of losing everything I’ve held so dear..."   In any case...Happy birthday to Katy and Bryan.   Aman, or...shall I say, "Ax" ;-) has gotten me hooked on all the quizzes she puts on her xanga...so this one comes from part of hers...  --  [i know]: Music is good. [i want]: More time.
