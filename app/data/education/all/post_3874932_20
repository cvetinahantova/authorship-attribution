OK -- I've been doing some runs this morning. The data behaves better if I remove from the non-adopters the group of people (about 35) who say they're still interested in adopting but haven't yet. When I do that:   age is negatively related to adoption  education level is positively related to adoption  Metro area (more or less rural vs urban) isn't quite significant   More interesting:   curiosity is positvely related to adoption  coping is NEGATIVELY related to adoption (but the there is no zero order relationship -- it becomes negative once other variables are included)  technology optimism is positively related to adoption  technology discomfort is not related to adoption (however, when you remove the seniors who were substantially helped in their adoption, then technology discomfort is negatively related to adoption).   I still want to look at use of other technologies, but have to figure out how to construct that from what I have.
