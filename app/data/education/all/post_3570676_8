The following links were chosen to assist a sixth grade science class in studying the chapter entitled: "Technology and Space Exploration: Past, Present, and Future".  I envisioned an internet research assignment in which a group of students would submit their findings in a class presentation on this chapter addressing one of the following themes:  Discovery, Pioneers, Vision, Equipment.    1.   urlLink        NASA Ames Research Center       Click on the heading: "The Vision for Space Exploration".  This site gives students access to articles, press releases, official statements, video archives, and public addresses.  By accessing these selections they will be exposed to President Bush's vision and statements for America's space program, the vision of NASA's Administrator, and the vision and comments from the NASA Space Commission.  Additionally, there are sites devoted to demonstrations of new technology such as the Personal Exploration Rovers.  2.   urlLink http://btc.montana.edu/ceres/html/EdActivities.html        NASA/MSU-Bozeman CERES Project.       At this site, students have access to classroom activities and projects that expose them to the challenges a person would face as an astronautical scientist.  Each activity is listed by grade level with a description of expected time required and the exact area of space research that is being addressed.  Students would choose from activities such as "First Manned Mission to Mars," "MarsQuest," "Every Picture Tells a Story," and "MountainQuest."    3.   urlLink http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/go/edis771/webquests2001sp/ssarahsouthall/webquest_student        "Explore Your Universe: A Web Quest for 6th Grade"       This site is devoted to space exploration with an emphasis on discovery.  Students will follow guided instruction within the website to explore the planets, stars, satellites, etc of our solar system.
