Noah has the bug.  It is one nasty bug too.   His temp is staying high even though I am alternating Motrin and Tylenol.  And he is having hallucinations.  Not a good thing.  We have to take him to the ER if he has another hallucination.  So we are really hoping he gets closer to normal.  Sheesh.   If this bug hits a new person in my house every 4 days, it will take us a good 3-4 weeks to get over this bug.  its not looking good!  Not good at all.
