Have you ever had one of those days where everything seems to move that bit slower?  Today was one of those.  I lazed around in bed till 11, 11.30, then showered and sat around in my towel (great look, right?), FTing and emailing.    Then at four, back to work.  We've got the prep schools tennis in now, and they are already proving to be hard work!!  But that's cool - in a fortnight I'll be almost done and preparing to go home.  Yes!  No doubt I'll be bored stiff after about 24 hours of the old hometown, but I know I really need to recharge, laze on the beach, drink wine, study up for next terms classes, pack up for the moves....  So I'll close now (my journals    always   end up sounding like letters.  No hangover today (still haven't grown into them, thank heavens!), but am pecked oot.  Current music:  The Keane album, Hopes and Fears.  It's pretty good, but my faves are still the singles (Somewhere Only We Know, and Everybody's Changing), and the single-to-be (Bedshaped). Current mood: Tired, happy, wistful, confused, anticipatory. Last person spoke to:  Kathryn and Louise, to sign off for the night.  Breakfast duty tommorrow - yuck. Next:  A little fametracker, then beddy-byes.  Mmmmmm.
