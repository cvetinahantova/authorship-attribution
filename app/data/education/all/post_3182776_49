Today, quite frankly, I have been a lazy bum.   Not a useful thing have I done, apart from run around the park, near drowning in my own sweat, which serves no purpose but to satisfy my own vanity. I think there will be a cummerbund to go with my dinner jacket on the wedding night, but I'd like to be wearing it out of  choice,  y'know?  I have watched so much cricket lately I'm surprised the BBC haven't asked me to commentate. I am clearly an expert and my insight is going to waste.  I am now about to book a really posh hotel for my wedding night. Go me!
