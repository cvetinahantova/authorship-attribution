----------------------------------------  Back From CO! --------------------- I was delighted by e response of e Sec 1 students of Junyuan Secondary School 2 NCC. It was seen as e best CCA to most of dem. I juz hope they dun regret joining e CCA later on. My small sis was dere 2. She was damn irritating.. toking and toking and toking as if her only goal was 2 irritate me. Errgghh! Den I went 2 Pasir Ris Sec. Met up wif Yasir, Hafizuddin, Faiz, Fairul and Hamizah dere. After helping out abit by talking 2 e sec 1 students we left. Our early departure was due 2 one reason. CLT Sulaiman of Pasir Ris Sec. He said dat he did not need our help and it was strict orders from e CO. Well.. The CO wasn't dere in sch, and the other officers were fine with it. I was sooo pissed off man. We went dere on e onli basis 2 help out and diz is e appreciation we get. I was so mad dat i went straight 2 e pull up bars and began doing pull ups.  We den went off 2 TM. Met up wif alot of old pals from NCC and ex-secondary sch. We den went on a tiring journey ard dat area. Dragging ourselfs 2 carry on. After a while it got realli boring and we went off 2 e Library 2 mit Fadzilla. She was bz studying wif her friend, so we Yasir cudn't interact wif her alot. Well.. borrowed some books and talked 2 her abit den we were off again! Now 2 e interchange 2 get home. While waiting for e bus wif yasir, we bumbed into Yati. She was wif a guy. As soon as i saw her, my face changed. I dunno why. I was suddenly emotional. I juz kept quiet, afraid dat i would say sumtink wrong. I juz gave e reason dat i was tired so dat she wun worry 2 much. I'm too into her now. Its either i give it up and get less hurt or go all e way and get deeply hurt again like wif haswani, which took me 4yrs 2 get over. I'm confused. I told myself not 2 like anybody anymore but i'm doing it again. Well.. dun worry abt me. I'll be fine.
