For some reason this particular posting site seems to be having trouble.  I cannot see my blog or anyone else who has a blogspot blog. I find this irritating and it makes me ready to just set out on my own.  But not yet.  I will be considering it though.  That is all.   UPDATE:  The problem I was having was actually with my particular firewall.  It seemed to think that suddenly any blogger site was bad and banned them all.  The problem has since been rectified.  Thank goodness.  I'm really not ready to set out on my own.
