Yesterday I was a gift-buying genius! I went to Hamley's and bought Wee Bead People for Alis' 8th birthday, then I went to the Contemporary Ceramics gallery and bought lovely Japanese stoneware for my in-laws' anniversary,  then  I went and queued for THE LONGEST HOUR OF MY LIFE at Cookson's to buy gold and silver wire for some impromptu jewellery making.   Studying in the wilds of Scotland means that I had never actually been to a bullion merchant before. It was very exciting! Everyone is behind bulletproof glass and the whole place can be secured and inescapable at the touch of a button. Wow. Weirdly, you also have to take a supermarket-style ticket before you can be served, giving the whole thing the air of a nuclear arms deli counter.   Do you think Scotland Yard will knock my door down at 4am for putting 'nuclear arms' in my blog?  This time next week I will be heading North to the land of milk and honey and coronary heart disease. Hooray! Also, the all-translating, all-interpreting, cow-loving, ankle-clicking, floor-sleeping karaoke giant that is Miss Emma is coming to stay on Saturday. This is more exciting than anyone can possibly imagine! I suspect my post on Friday night will consist entirely of exclamation marks.  In other news, the boy has signed us up for a free trial of an amazing DVD rental service where you go online and make a list of films you want to watch and one falls through your letterbox every couple of days. It's great! Also, you end up with bizarre combinations; tonight I have the choice of Schindler's List or School of Rock, for example.  And now I am going to Sainsbury's. x
