I spent most of my weekend watching the  urlLink Trading Spaces  marathon on  urlLink TLC .  I'm addicted to that show ("where neighbors trade houses for 24 hours and redecorate one room...").  It's pretty funny to watch when the decorator takes over and then the people hate what he/she has done.  Inspired by the show, I spent today at my mom's house watching Trading Spaces and working on a couple of sewing projects.  I've never taken any sort of home ec. class or been taught to sew, but for some reason I always dramatically overestimate my sewing abitlities.  "It's pushing fabric through a machine in a straight line," I tell myself.  "How hard can it be?"  Well, as I found out today, much more difficult than I had anticipated.  I had three projects planned and I thought I could get two done and the other at least started.  I ended up getting one done (the pillows for the chair in our family room are now officially recovered in fabric that matches the new couch), and another started (new pillow shams for the bedroom).  The other (throw pillows for our bedroom--to go with the new shams, of course) I didn't even start.    Since I have all next week off, maybe I'll actually be able to finish the shams  and  get the pillows done before I go back to work...
