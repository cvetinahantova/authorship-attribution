I seem to have completely overloaded myself with work that i don't really want to do at the moment. I have some homework that i must do this half term (prob. on sunday night!), i need to finish the pictures for Chris first priority), i have a camera club (yes camera club!)outing on the 13th of June (though that i'm looking forward to!), grade 6 piano on the 16th June (groan!), 18th June is a French language festival where we're doing a couple of songs i have to learn off-by-HEART!!(in french!!) and the 25th June is an English (thank goodness) public speaking competition, like the one i did last year; and last year we won two awards so this year i have a lot to live up to! Plus, i'm speaker this time (real scary!!) but i have Angus as my chairperson so that should be great fun! Though, i'm not looking forward to it. Ah well, at least most of these things give me an afternoon off school! That attempt to cheer me up about these things was in vain. I, quite seriously, need to learn the word N-O, but it's so hard to say no when so many different people are confident you'll do their thing. Argh. Choke.     Despite all this though, i'm not in a bad mood. I'm sitting in my bedroom with the window wide open and the birds are chirping like mad. There are some that go 'chirp chirp chirp chirp...' one that goes 'peep' every couple of seconds and then 'peep peep' and a woodpigeon occasionally calling out in the distance. It makes me feel very at home, since i've always heard the woodpigeons around my house! Also, i have my mini-skirt on (that makes me feel  powerful ) and some new clothes on; which always makes me feel good! And i have been browsing one of my favourite websites;  urlLink  Planet Sark  ! If you're ever feeling blue then give it a visit and, trust me, it will cheer you up no end! Either that, or read some of the beautiful stories and the   StoryPeople  .Â   Time for a cup of tea i think!
