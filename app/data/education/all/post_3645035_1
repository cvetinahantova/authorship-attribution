Marijuana is a devious thing in that it is omnipotent in subcultures requiring a certain lack of regard for those beings incapable of thought that refers to substance abuse as a good thing. Whoops, here comes the train of thought, last stop is the smot pokers! Among undescribable and obscene things today is the invisible presence of evidence of substance abuse in certain areas. It is clear that Ralph working at the record store is not puffing the magic dragon although the area has a distinct herbal scent. Could this have been caused by a bath soap? Methinks that a theory is in the works here. Smoke drifts skyward. People toke in dark, low places. When ganja smoke particles gain more energy the smoke becomes less dense and drifts upward. Convection applies and gives the area smoke. Could the offshoot of ganja smoke become a liquid and saturate the air in a record store? Methinks yes. This leads me to believe that numerous people die each year in Ontario as a result of drowning as a result of hotboxing too much and saturating the air with the burnings of substance abuse. In order for such drownings to occur, the air would have to be SUPER-SATURATED. It is also my theory that Buffalo Springfield was a victim of the super-saturation of air as a result of massive substance abuse. There was a death caused once when a man stuck his head inside a functioning bong. Allegedly, the fumes burned his face off. It is my belief that the air inside the bong in question was super-saturated. In conclusion, I would like to warn you that hotboxing crazy detergent marijuana may result in an undesirable pH level. In case you did not pay attention in grade 8 gym class, marijuana bought off the street contains high levels of cleaning products which are strong bases. Super-saturated air as a result of extremely basic pH errrrb smoke is hazsardous to your health in a similar way to drinking a bottle of Tide. So remember kids, stay away from drugs and wear a lifejacket when you hotbox.
