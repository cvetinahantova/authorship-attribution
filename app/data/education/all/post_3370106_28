Today was rainy, but needed.  The tomato plants were parched, but still they are overgrown, the entire yard is.  Still, I wait patiently for the opportunity to present itself.  Pruning, weeding, beating the fecundity down so that I can easily walk a clear path.    It is the clear path that I seek.  So I look within, because I find myself there, completely immersed in eternal, cosmic consciousness.  I'm learning to live from within my body, my being instead of viewing/feeling like some disconnected machine that I'm outside of and incapable of controlling, always wanting to fix, agitated by its slipping.  It is the only thing I can control to some degree...my breath, my stretch, my tension, my focus, my intention, my delusion, realizing the edges of my vista and the depth of my soul spiralling off into chaos, returning to union.
