Well, I've gotten a ton of work done... in fact  I've gotten it done twice. I had just gotten to the coloring stage on the  picture when the program crashed, and I realized that I hadn't saved it, so I  had to redraw the picture, again. At least I'm getting that much more practice.  The way I was originally going to shade the picture didn't look very good, so  I'm trying something new, and it'll probably look like crap, but I'll just keep  working on it until I get it...  Anyway, I'm being forced to go to bed, as usual.  I'll have to get the dog to scoot over a bit, because she's stolen a  considerable amount of my floorspace.
