There's something about rain that feels so fresh.  I'm not a fan of lightening and I have just found out that neither is Lucy.  I do love thunder..... too bad I can't get one without the other.  Right now I'm sitting in my house ready to go to bed and there's a huge storm that is just brushing by Bowling Green.  It's close enough that there's constant thunder and lightening, but the rain just plops (literally plops) down randomly.  Ooh, it would be so nice to go to bed and have a heavy rain just beat down on my roof (my bedroom is great for rain-- those tall ceilings are the best!)  I have a feeling that's not going to happen.  Maybe because I just checked 2 (count 'em TWO) live doppler radars that don't show anything going right through Bowling Green.  hehehe.  Well, it's just as well because I need to find some great science activities to do for the rest of the year (all 7 days!  I can't believe it!)   Goodnight for now.....  2 posts in one day!  wow.  Lucy just licked my nose.  I guess that means that it's really time to go.
