ring ring machine picks up  not here screening calls leave a message if it makes you feel better  I have fallen hard for this cave and its interior decorations how it fits  whatever surfaces into consciousness  unhealthy maybe but I'm enjoying the fade out lost my appetite for civilization and its discontents and its spokespeople  I'm having a daydream in your nightmare where only foreign tongues are spoken by the hard of hearing it's as entertaining as it is frustrating  thought maybe if I could slip away unnoticed I could explore down the corridors where the conditioned fear to tread  I've got one foot out and tangled webs struggle to hold one foot in I stand between what I long for with a foothold in each  Â©2003 DC Vision
