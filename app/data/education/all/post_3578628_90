(THIS BY NO MEANS MEANS THAT I DO NOT FEEL SORRY THAT SHE DIED)  It's awful that now I have a hard time figuring out whether or not certain trials are important or not.  Right now, the one that I keep hearing about seems to be just a murder.  I mean, stuff like this happens here in Indiana but it doesn't make frontpage like Laci Peterson's death did.  Yet, America is concerned with it. What's so special about it?  There's two possibilities: She was walking a dog and was abducted or she was killed at home and then dumped into the San Francisco Bay.  Or wait there's one other possibility... It's far out but people haven't considered it.  Seeing how they considered all this other garbage maybe they should throw this in.  Because they've considered his alibi that he was fishing... which if I did murder someone, I wouldn't tell them I was fishing considering that she washed onto the shores two miles from where he said he was fishing.  Scott Peterson doesn't even know what he was fishing for.  On top of that, it's been said the way they are testing the hair found on the boat is flawed.  Possibly satanic cult connections?  Defense guesses that maybe the killer dumped it to link it to Scott because he could be linked.  So here's the far out idea.  I think a girl and a baby just like Laci Peterson and her baby came up on shore.  And Scott his hiding the real Laci somewhere in San Francisco.  Anyways... Put his ass in the slammer!  I know too much about this stupid trial.  It's just not that important.
