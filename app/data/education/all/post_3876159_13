Don't you just love Fridays!!!  The sun is shining, the birds are singing and the scent of two days off is in the air.  The weekend is at my feet and the possibilities are endless.   Ok, probably not really. I have to read this horrible text book and have procrastinated all week long.  I have the best intentions to read it and I do. I get off work, eat some dinner and at about 7pm I hit the books.  But then it is so so so dull that after a page I have to get something to drink.  And then I come back to the book.  After another page and a half and twenty pages of notes ( I am telling you, this has got to be the hardest thing I have ever read), I need a snowcone.  And then I am hungry, and then I decide after two hours and three pages....I should probably start packing up stuff to go to G-town.  And by midnight (or "mezzanotte" as my people like to say it) I think, I better get to bed so I can have a more productive day tomorrow.  Of course, every day of this week was like that.     I am never going to get through this book.  But by george!!! I am doing it this weekend if it kills me.  I have to have a 6 page report on it by the end of this month :((.   I better get to work. I have a great Friday ahead of me.  Fridays at work are always fabulous.  I am telling you...wanna motivate me? Give me a day off and I will work for you forever!!   Happy Friday everyone!!!!!!   Ciao a tutti!!!
