Every parent of every child thinks that child is the star of the team.  Someone once told me that and I have no doubt that it is true.  I know that I feel that way about my 2 sons.  The difference between parents is that I refuse to yell and scream at a coach if they do not play my sons the way I think they should.  When a player is just learning to play baseball let's say, they need to learn the game and play as much as possible in a lot of different positions.  But after playing for 8 years, there are some players that don't belong in certain positions.  They can't handle the ball and they might get hurt.  No one wants to sit on the bench the whole game.  I think that they should play somewhere every game, but better players deserve to play more.  We have become so concerned with not hurting someone's self-esteem, that we forget that is exactly what we do when a   team   loses because a poorer player makes mistakes that a better player might not have made.  Parents need to lighten up and let a coach do his/her job.  We won't always agree with everything they do, but that's what makes it fun.  Arm chair quarterbacks and second guessing is the best part about sports.
