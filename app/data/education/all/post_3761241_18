i'm finally at home now, and it feels great. the moment i stepped out of the airport, and i felt the hot, humid, summer air rush into me, i could only greet back to it with content. what else was i to do, and what can i say? i'm home now. of course, by this time, it was already 9:00 p.m. local time in japan, and it sure felt as hell like it was two in the afternoon after all that travelling. anyways, so here i was, tired but jetlagged, and we finally made it home at eleven after stopping by at a place for a quick bite to eat (between you and me, i loathe inflight food - most of the time, they taste so nasty!), and by then, my grandparents were so tired, they hit the sack. so here i was, alone, and so i decided that i should check up on my e-mail. i got a bunch of junk mail, but the highlight of it all was that stuart sent me an e-mail down from jo'burg down at south, wishing me a (in advance) happy birthday. of course, the amazing thing was, that was my first honest and true "happy birthday" that i had received from anyone apart from family. it was an odd feeling, but satisfying to know someone remembers, nonetheless. i'd say that, for me, it was one of my greater "welcome home" greetings.
