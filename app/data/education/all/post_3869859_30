Earlier this afternoon, as I was sitting at my desk, I noticed some birds were squawking outside the window and making a lot of racket! I didn't pay much attention, but I did notice that Vera (my brother's nice cat) was sitting out in the backyard.  As I was fixing dinner, I saw a tiny bird out on the grass stretching its wings as if it were learning to fly. How adorable! When I went to investigate further, I noticed Vera watching the little baby bird carefully, too. Vera started walking towards it, and both of the parent birds swooped down from their perches on nearby trees and squawked at her. Frightened, she dashed under the trampoline in the backyard.  Finally, I scooted her inside so that the baby bird could get back to its nest.
