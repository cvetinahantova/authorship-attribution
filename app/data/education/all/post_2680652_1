Ma first trial.  I would like to congratulate myself for finally realizing the dream, for reaching the impossible dream, huahahaha!! That's a lie! I'm glad I have this blog. I hope it leads to the fulfillment of my wildest dream: To be a  W R I T E R. A successful, an entertaining,  pokoke  a damn good writer.  A tribute is specially dedicated to an old friend of mine from my senior high era,  urlLink Umar . It was from him that I (indirectly) learn the amazing world of blogs. Thank you ya Pak!
