Morning.. there’s no sadness Happiness wherever you look No hatred between us human Good times, cheerfulness, joyfulness Love around the world, peaceful always there But No night     Night.. Tears and sadness Hatred, chaos, wars Everywhere you look Bad times are there Everything are separated Because No morning     Now They’ve crossed path   I can laugh having you in my life But, when you walked out of me………I can cry   Because of morning, I can hold you tight at night And because of night I can say good morning to you
