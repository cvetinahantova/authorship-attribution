I find it hard to like someone I disagree with so much; yet that is the case with Nader.  I saw an interview with him, and I find him to be straightforward, upfront, and logical.  I disagree with most of his positions, but there are a few that I must admit are valid.  The only one I agree with totally; electoral reform.  I think that both parties have done poorly for America.  They only have to run against each other, and it is always a two way choice.  What about others who don't fit into this agenda?  Arnold Schwarzenegger does NOT fit the republican mold due to his position on social issues.  How does he fit into the overall mold?  Should he choose his party on economic issues only?  This makes little sense to me.  The governor of Calfornia belongs to a political party that disagrees with him on many issues.  How about the voter?  I find it hard to believe that 93% of African-Americans that did vote, voted for Gore in the last presidential election.  Why?  Because the republicans have a racist record.  This may be the case, yet most Aftican-Americans are religious and do agree with many conservatives!  Entitlements have apparently not worked, and activists such as Cosby and Lee are attesting to this.  The Democrats are completely oblivious to their wants and now the republicans are too.  In ten years they will be completely disenfranchised.  Where is their party?  And for the average joe, how can they be a part of the process?  It is terribly difficult to compete when nepotism and money are bloating both parties.  Populism doesn't exist, because it is impossible to break in in a grass-roots effort without the blessing of the party chiefs.  This again alienates when we should should try to encompass.  So Ralph, you are wrong on most issues, but I respect you.  You believe in what you say, and it is for the people that you do it.  Keep getting your message out, for you are expressing what our forefathers envisioned.
