Well, we have arrived home from Scranton, and I've finished unpacking.  I'll never see my paternal grandmother or grandfather again, which saddens me.  My grandmother (Nana) said to my dad that if he walked out of that door, it would never open to him again.  She has always put us on guilt trips (especially when Sarah or I was alone) and my dad says she seems to enjoy pushing his buttons.  But this rarely happens to my dad's older brother, Carl.  Dad says he was always the whipping boy, since Carl left for Vietnam in the war.  Carl and his wife Minda left a little before Dad grew really angry (which rarely happens).  Nana told him she didn't have to listen to this, and left.  Dad then followed her...she really aggravates me...us.  I have never seen Dad so angry.  He and her woke Sarah and me up, with their yelling stuff.  Mom said she was washing her face when she heard them start yelling, and then didn't want to leave the bathroom.  Anyway, it all ended with Dad and Mom going upstairs to talk with Nana, and then Poppy said he hoped that we'd all make up before we left.  Which never happened.  He told Sarah and me to make sure that we gave Nana a big hug before we left.  We began to walk up the stairs when Mom and Dad came down, but then Nana was standing at the top of the stairs.  She just looked at Sarah and me like she was ready to rip off our heads, and slammed the door.  So I left the house and went in the van and blasted my music.  That had to have been the worst, and final, visit.  Nana kept dragging Grammy into the conversation.  I pretended to be asleep when Dad and Nana were in the hallway.  Nana walked in and said, "he never treats Grammy like this, now, does he?"  Sarah wanted to tell her that Grammy never pushes Dad's buttons, and I wanted to tell her not to bad mouth Grammy.  Dad says Nana can be controlling...I can't wait to see Grammy, Papa, and Cindy later today.   I need to relax.
