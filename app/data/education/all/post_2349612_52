contemporary social problem of the day: creepy old men who like to whistle  this doesn't sound like your typical contemporary social problem, but in fact it is.  at least 3 times today i've encountered creepy looking older men whistling christmas tunes quite loudly, be it crossing paths in a campus parking lot, sitting at the next table over in starbucks, or well i guess being on campus and in starbucks sums up my day so far, so pretty sure #3 must also have been on campus.  all 3 answer to the decription of late 50s/early 60s, greasy, with long gray hair... none of them were whistling in tune, and all of them were whistling christmas songs... mostly sheer coincidence, but kinda strange all the same... i guess creepy would be if it was the same greasy old not-whistling-in-tune man every time =P  blah  back to math
