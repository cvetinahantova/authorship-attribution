Ok, so the phone rings this morning. I answer it (hello?). Beth, the vice principal from the school I had an interview at) is on the other end. (my heart pounding) She says, I wanted to call and tell you (did I get it, did I get it????) that you are one of our top canidates for the job. (sheesh!) She called me to tell me that?????????? She said whe was going to make some calls to references and then let me know tonight or tomorrow if I got the job. Grrrr....just makes me worry more.  On a happier note, I lost more weight. almost 15 lbs. now that I've lost. I'm so excited. Did I mention that I don't have to shop in the plus sizes anymore??? Cool, huh?  Signing off.....  Current mood.....tired
