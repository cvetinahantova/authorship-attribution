I just watched some of the D.C. anti-war demonstration on C-SPAN.  Just how big was that crowd?  Some media accounts put it at tens of thousands, but I'd guess maybe 4-5000, tops.  Also, I didn't catch her whole speech, but I was struck by the mother of the Marine who wanted to get out because he was opposed to war.  If so, then why in God's name did he join the Marines?
