so i'm in indiana for the 3rd time this trip!  staying with tammy and marcus (tammy as in math/cs buddy from valpo, and marcus is her husband... i was a bridesmaid in their wedding last may) just NW of indy.  last night i was indoctrinated -- saw wayne's world 1 and 2 with marcus (tammy was at work during the 1st one, and tammy fell asleep partway through the 2nd)... inbetween we had pizza and marcus's sister jenette was over with her two kids (ages 2 and 13 months)... it was a fun evening.  today, after making a mess making pancakes with tammy we went to the indy children's museum (5 floors of fun including a planetarium)... apparently the world's largest children's museum... i got trapped in a racecar (ask for details another time)... and greatly enjoyed the planetarium shows and had lots of fun with everything else too -- it was really well put together, and a party and a half =)  we stayed at the museum til it closed at 5 then headed into downtown to the soldiers and sailors monument in the center of the city... paid the $1 to get to the top and take pictures of the city from up high... then wandered circle center mall for a bit.  now, we're back at marcus and tammy's place (cute farmhouse they're renting with cows in the backyard =P) for dinner... later will be stargazing and mooooovie. =) (bend it like beckham since tammy's never seen it... i bought the soundtrack today and am majorly excited about it =P)  the plot after tonight? i meet heather miller for church in the AM (45 minute drive... tammy and marcus are NW of town, heather's church is S of town), have lunch with her, then drive 5 hours NE to bowling green, OH to hang out with alliswan for her birthday (monday) -- excited about seeing both of them as well!  at any rate, that's the plot... an excellent saturday to all y'all... be parties! =)
