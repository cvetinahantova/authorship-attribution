well friends and fellow  urlLink   24    fans, we are now much more akin to the ticking scene changes of our favorite television show than ever before! feast your weary blogging eyes on our very own stat tracking counter!!! (*it's just below the "archives" section on the left*)  you may say to yourself, "So what, a counter, big deal.."  but this counter is pretty sweet, drag your mouse over to it, click it, and you can check out amazing information about who is visiting this site! of course i think you have to have the password, and im the only one who has it.... but i will post some statistics when some people actually start to log in. the coolest part it that it will show a  urlLink map of the world with a dot  of where people are logging in from. so hopefully  urlLink darren  will log on soon and we can see a nice red blip glimmering up at us from way  urlLink south of the border .  anyway enough g33k sp34k, im going to go make sure my cat doesn't get blownup by some errant fireworks.
