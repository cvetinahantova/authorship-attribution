urlLink History of Israel  I blogged this site because I think it might make a good information literacy assignment.  See the following:  "Israel has endured constant hostility from it's Arab neighbors who hate Jews.  It is probable that peace will not come to the Middle East until Arab states cease their anti-semitism, demand Palestian's to end their terrorist acts, and accept Israel as a sovereign nation with the right to exist peacefully."  This ends what was until then a rather balanced essay.  Clearly, this site has some bias which is not readily evident until the reader has invested some time into reading the essay.  I think an assignment could be  created that used this site, a pro-Palestinian site, and an unbiased site for the students to compare.  I think small groups followed up by a group reports on what everyone discovered could really benefit students and help them to detect bias in history pieces on the Web.
