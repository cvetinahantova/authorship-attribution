We were asked to make an outline from the thesis statement which were discussed in the class.My  thesis statement for the position paper is "Sensory devices in 'Dulce Et Decorum Est'(DEDE) heighten the readers horror of war".We too, are being told to develop the points into two to three paragraphs.         In order to write this position paper, I have read and reread the poem for several times and posing questions and looking for the answers, all by myself.... alone. In informal way, most of us know how to read and respond to literature but when it comes  to write it down, we have to take our informal judgements about a poem , (for instance) and through reflection and analysis, transform them into reasoned and arguments.         Coming back to 'DEDE' by Wilfred Owen, the sensory images used do appeal to the readers.The phrase,"He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning", gives the readers mind picture on how the soldiers were in terrible pain and how suffering they were. In line 22,"Come gargling from the froth corrupted lungs"is another example of sensory devices which can be disturbing to think about. It evokes emotions so as to cause people to become sick. By referring to those words ,  it clearly stated to us the horror of war.
