My sister in law, Bonnie, called me last night. Things are not going well with my Mom. She had another doctor's appointment yesterday, and was told the cancer has not only returned, but spread.   She's going to have another round of chemo, but apparently that is only to prolong the amount of time she has left, which they are estimating to be around 6 months. She has been advised to settle her affairs and after this last set of chemo, will enter home hospice.   At this point, I haven't spoken to my Mom, partly because Bonnie and I were on the phone until around 4 this morning. The other reason is because my Mom asked Bonnie not to tell me. She doesn't want me to give up the Fellows program to come home and stay with her. (Of course, being my mother, she sees that as her decision, not mine!) I've left a message with Mom's nurse, and am waiting for her to call me with the medical issues. So, I'm going to call Mom, like normal, tonight, and see what she says and give her the chance to tell me in her own way.   I know there are only a few of you reading this right now, but this was the best way I could think of to put out a general cry for the help I'm going to need in the upcoming months as I try to make some hard decisions about what is best for myself and my family.   Please pray for us.
