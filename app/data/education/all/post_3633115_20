I live in the only place in Texas that has a legal clothing optional public beach.   urlLink Hippie Hollow  is a popular location around here, whether people have been or not.  Yesterday was my first visit.  At first I didn't quite realize that clothing optional meant ALL clothing.  I was initially trepidatious about removing my top, but then I realized that while this area is not a "gay" people spot, many of those who were there were busy checking out S rather than me.  So, yep within short order I was fully nekkid at a public park, in broad daylight, around other nekkid people, and I had so much fun!  Who knew that just hanging out on a lake without any clothes, on a really nice day to even out my tan would be so much fun!  The water was a perfect temperature and I don't generally like water that contains animal life in it.  I must say that I encourage others to try it at least once in their life.  If you can't be nekkid in front of complete strangers that you will likely never see again, who can you be nekkid in front of??
