I suppose that is a good sign though.  Forgetting to post means that I'm not entirely obsessed with blogging. Right?  Anyway, I was out of town visiting family.  Informing them I pregnant, when my mom says that I don't have to worry about the timing of the birth, she'll just come here and help take care of the baby until I finish the semester at school.  This wouldn't be such a bad offer, but as some others may   urlLink recall , my mom and I don't get along very well after a period of time.  However, I still want her here, so that S doesn't have to take a lot of vacation time (which he has already said he would rather do than have my mom here). *sigh*    Where is that damned life instruction manual?
