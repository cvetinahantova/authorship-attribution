It's me again.  Went to dinner with my family yesterday.  We went to a stakehouse.  It was sooooo good.  LOL.  I was stuffed.  Of course, I ordered steak.  I got a big one.  Man, I enjoyed myself.  I won't do that for a while.  LOL  When coming from work, yesterday, I saw the damnedest thing.  This guy was on the street with an erection going.  He looked like he was going to pop outta his pants.  I suppose it's pervert season near/at the library.  He really should go home with all that. I kept walking.  I didn't need to see any more.    I've seen and heard worse on the job.  Guys exposing themselves to library patrons.  This seems to come with the summer time.    I remember last year  when a guy exposed himself upstairs, and I asked the young woman if she wanted to call public saftey.  She said "no," but I had to insit she call. because she saw the incident, not me.  My boss took the conversation over, and afterwards tried to chastise me and my co-worker for not reacting "quick enough."  He also insisted that we were laughing at the woman (which was very untrue).     God, he was so out of line.  I let him know I did what was required, and I think he was mad at me for doing my job and standing up for myself.  THAT is why sometimes my job sucks.
