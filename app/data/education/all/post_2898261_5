Dedicated to: ADMV, CA and SMR  As I quietly smoke this cigarette I distractedly look to the skies And there you are, the brightest star shining down from the sky And I wonder, Are you glowing so brightly where you are? Can they see you so clearly as I can?  As I quietly smoke this cigarette I abstractedly hear a passing car And there he goes, a complete stranger to you and I And i wonder Does his heart ache with such treacherous pain? Can he unburden his pain to his loves?  As I quietly smoke this cigarette I distantly focus on the street light And it cries out Lead me to their path to light up the way Lead me to their hearts to guide them nearby  As I quietly smoke end my cigarette I resolutely remember your words And I wonder If one day the sadness that invades you will ever disperse and leave you to smile?
