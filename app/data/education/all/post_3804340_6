After reading my friend's blog about urlLink  scam , I would like to add a remark.  According to Cambridge dictionary, scam means 'An illegal plan of making money.'.  Online scam is advanced level scam. I myself came across elementary level scam. Luckily I never get corned.  Causeway Bay of HK is a very popular place for elementary level scam. Since I was 18, people keep coming over and said 'Oh! This T-shirt is cute (which you can buy it in local chain clothes shop like Giodano, Bossini) and it fits u so much! (too tight?), where did u get it?'    ' Wow! The very first moment you hear about that 'compliment', your ego dances! (My broad shoulders, my plumpy body and my elephant legs had received a lot of compliments these years.) Then they will keep on saying 'Oh! My company is hiring a fitting model. Are you interested? The payment is very attractive ......' blah blah blah.........  If you haven't woken up from the illusion, you will fall into the trap easily. Once you go with them, they will say you have to receive some trainings before they can offer you a job. Then you say goodbye to your money before you receive any.  Regardless of the levels, scam catches your weaknesses and attacks. It can be greed it can be fame. It remains me of a movie, Seven...... I remember a poet said, 'Applause is the massage for your ego'. Be careful that applause becomes the slap......
