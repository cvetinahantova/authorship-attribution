Pitiful, isn't she?  urlLink      urlLink      So, we went to the doctor today!  No problems, nothing.  And she's 43 and 1/2 inches tall...that's pretty long for a 4 year old.  Vision and audio tests went ok...the audio test did give us problems, but the Dr. said it was common with kiddos that have tubes.  Three shots and one TB test, so she was pretty tired after all that crying, and slept for almost 3 hours, and that was only because I woke her up.  :)
