urlLink Concerto in a Minor: Beans, Beans...  I grew up believing that beans were a fruit.  My dad convinced me of this as everytime we ate chili he would sing, "Beans, beans, the magical fruit, the more you eat, the more you toot."  I remember arguing that beans were a fruit with my teacher in elementary school.  She finally convinced me that beans were vegetables.  You can see how I was confused by my dad.  I am sure that this would be a good lecture point on how bad information gets passed off as fact but it is probably best if I avoid this topic with the students.  And, my dad didn't even come up with this song!  You can find the lyrics to it all over the Web...
