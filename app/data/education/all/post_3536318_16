Life is good...  They just opened up a tavern across the street from me.  And when I say "across the street", I don't mean it in the "within the proximity of 1/2 a mile" kind of "across the street."  I mean "ACROSS THE STREET" I was really bored the other day, so I figure it all out.    1. The Front door of the tavern is approximately 15 ft infront of my kitchen balcony.  2. My kitchen balcony is approximately 15 feet up above the ground.  3. Now if you apply pythagorium's theorem to this situation a^2 + b^2 = c^2), I have to jump 21.213203435596425732025330863145 ft to get from my balcony to the bar.  BUT.  you don't jump in a straight line, so we'll have to factor in arc.  Considering that the distance between the ground in front of my apartment and the bar is the same as between the ground and my balcony, we'll take that distance (15ft) to be the radius of a quartered circle.  We'll use the Radius (R) and apply it to the formula for circumference: circum=2*pi*R with pi=3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751  05820974944592307816406286208998628034825342117067  98214808651328230664709384460955058223172535940812  84811174502841027019385211055596446229489549303819  64428810975665933446128475648233786783165271201909  14564856692346034861045432664821339360726024914127  37245870066063155881748815209209628292540917153643  67892590360011330530548820466521384146951941511609  43305727036575959195309218611738193261179310511854  80744623799627495673518857527248912279381830119491   (Yup, we ain't joking around here.  We're going 500 digits deep into PI baby.  We don't want anything short of the most accurate answer. {Even though we've been approximating every other factor up until now})  That gives us a 133.2864881447509874104764297018 ft circumference.  But since we're only dealing with a quarter of the whole, we'll divide it by 4.  The result being: I have to jump 33.32162203618774685261910742545 ft (or 6 liters) to make it from the top railing of my balcony to the bar.  Whoa.. I'm exhausted..  If you're looking for me, I'll be across the street having a beer...  That is, if I survive the landing.
