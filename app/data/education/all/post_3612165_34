John and Lorraine had been dating each other for years and were getting bored of each other. They became like a married couple, nagging and sarcasm in all their conversations. One day John met a girl named Cleary. She was pretty, smart and funny and John longed to break up with Lorraine and date Cleary but he couldnî–¹. Then one day Lorraine was walking along the side of a river when she fell in and drowned. When John heard the news he was so happy he sang "I can see Cleary now, Lorraine has gone." http://www.greatestpunsonearth.com/home/home.php
