Doing call centre work at Sheffield University at the moment.  8am - 6pm talking to distraught a level students.  Things are a bit slower today than yester- hence the number of posts.  Sugary snacks being liberally dispersed... eating too many.  Feel a bit like Dewey from last night's Malcom in the Middle.
