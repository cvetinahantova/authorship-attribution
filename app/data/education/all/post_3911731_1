Today was a  semi good day. I didnt do anything at all today but play some madden, get on here some, go to the firehouse for about 30 minutes, and watch a movie, i was fine with all that, I didn't get to bored and I talked to janelle for a bit also. Anyways, the movie i watched today was "Hatred of a Minute" another one of the movies in my horror movie collection. You can check out my movie collection here:  urlLink http://guzzlefish.com/collection.php?username=yourdemise47&PHPSESSID=492c74b0d61990c5f83ff0af82276866    Check out the value!   Me and janelle started watching hatred of a minute the other night and she didn't care for it much, so i turned it off so we could do other stuff. Well i watched it tonight and I must say, it was a great movie. The ending was awesome. Thats all I will say about that. Ummm...I don't really know what else to say.  I guess I will part with you, i will go to bed now, I have to get up at 6:30 for football, I think im hanging out with janelle tomorrow night, it will be fun. Update tomorrow night, PEACE.
