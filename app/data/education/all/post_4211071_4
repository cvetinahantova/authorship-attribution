Life is wonderful. Life is great...       I had my first exam this morning. The first paper was  English I  and the second was  Maths 'D' I ... I was quite good and hell. Thank  God  I set my alarm @ 6:00 a.m. Last night, I told my mom to wake me up @ 6 a.m. but then it ends up with me the one waking my parents up... And I came late to school. My dream study hut already occupied by the other lads... As usual, while waiting for my paper to come, I prayed endlessly... Hoping for the best~      Whether you believe it or not, I did predict the topics that were supposed to be out for English. And it did! It was the second part... Magazine article! I wrote about my favorite teacher of all,  Mrs. Teresita R. Asuncion . I didn't really know her all-out but I tried... After all, composition is all about making-up stories... I hope that I will get a B in English... Adding with my paper 2 (coming soon... 28/8) and oral.      I went back home at 12:30 p.m., fetched by dad. Then he drove the car to  Jangsak  and pick my little nephew,  Syawqi . Then I logged in to  MSN ... Chat with  Nurul . It was until 3:3o p.m. that I was off because I had to join my dad to fetch my mom at her office... I had to go because my nephew was going as well and guess what, he brought along 15 bucks with him...  haiyaa ~ Imagine that he is still 2 years old but already know the value of money... btw: I have no bucks left~ only $4... ( ashamed eh. .)      As usual, we stopped by @ SupaSave, Gadong. I shopped for food with my nephew while my mom went queuing @ Baiduri Bank. Dad as usual, buying newpaper at the bookstore. Can you imagine doing your shopping with a 2 years-old boy??? Aiyoo... He kept on choosing the things and put it in the basket... Thank  God  that my money is very much "enough" to pay all... But no worries~ My nephew got his own... heheh :)      Funniest thing of the day.. psstt... don't tell anyone. This is quite embarrased and I know that if whole of my friends know, I'll be dead into   FAME OF ASHAMED  ... Wanna know?? This morning, my mom bought me a new towel.. And guess what? She bought me a BARBIE towel......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is all pink in color... My sister got the same and my big brother (whose age 25) got a spiderman towelll........... wakakakaka!!!!!!!!!!      I guess that's all... my fingers getting lame now...
