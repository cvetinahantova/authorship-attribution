I am, as perhaps are most of us, struggling with integrating my values with my behaviour. In particular, I wish to be able to look at my everyday life and feel satisfied that I have lived each day to the full, and made choices (including the choice to keep to habits, which are choices that are held to over a period of time) that are in pursuit of my values. I am writing this far too late in the night, for example. This blog will be to some extent a personal confessional, although I aim to keep it positive and solution focussed. I will record the basics such as when I go to bed, rise, and whether I have achieved some of the basic daily/weekly goals. There are a whole load of things that I am not happy about in my current everyday life. The first aims I have for the next week or two are to be regular about my bedtime and rising, my exercise, and my core goals. I will go into more detail as I progress. Right now I am going to go to bed, much too late, and get too little sleep, and hope to make the most of tomorrow nonetheless.  The hope is that by 'going public' with my goals, I will leverage social pressure as well as my own self-regard/respect.
