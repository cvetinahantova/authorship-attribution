Good morning.  I'd like to apologise for all the exclamation marks and caps-locking of late. There is no excuse, really.  I got up about half an hour ago because I woke up with all the tunes from School of Rock going round and round on my internal jukebox and because it was hot and irksome lying down. And because the boy was snoring like an adenoidal bandsaw.   touch me baby, ba-ba-ba-baa, Lawrence is good at pia-no! ba-ba-ba HHHNNNNNNRRRRRRRRK HNNNNN HHRRRRRNK   You get the picture.  I'm sure I'll regret getting up so mindlessly early and end up getting all cranky and being sent to my room before dinner, but never mind.
