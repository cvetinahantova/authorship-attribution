There was a movie on TV the other day:  urlLink Two Ninas .  It's funny because the main character has the same job as I do.  He's an Agate Clerk in the sports deptartment of a newspaper.  Of course he worked at the New York Post and I work at the Valley Press.  But that's neither here nor there. The main character is based on the life of the writer and director of the movie, who was actually an agate clerk in real life.  He stared at box scores all day like me.  He became disillusioned with his job after 17 months and quit it to go make a movie.  I won't comment on the similarities between myself and the main character (although one of the ninas is pretty close to my dream girl).  I'll just say that someday I'm planning to take some time off of work as well.  I think a decade off sounds about right to me.
