6 days not connected to the cyber world and my mailbox exceeded its limit.  I thought I will be able to gain access to the internet freely once I got home, yet to my shock the computer isn't there anymore!! The truth is, my brother brought it back to UTM, Johor with him. I can't put the blame on him because he didn't know I'll be going back so soon and the computer was already collecting dust at home.  Anyway, coincidentally I was back just in time to attend the memorial service and funeral of my church member who was among the 7 involved in the helicopter incident. I was hearing lots of rumor concerning the incident saying that the jungle is 'dirty' , 'creepy' and all the sorts, that's why the rescue team couldn't find the copter though it was just 5 minutes flying distance from the rescue teams' headquarter. I don't really believe what was said, but I haven come up with my own theory yet. Maybe we'll never know the actual reason. One main thing mentioned by the preachers during the memorial service was the question: "Why bad things happen to good people?" The answer given was: "We may never be able to come up with a good answer to the question while we're still on earth." It reminds me of the time when I used to ask my Sunday School teachers and youth leaders the same question. The answer that i got was : bad things happen because of people's sin; quoting Job's case and saying that it's a trial or test, and that at the end of the day Job was blessed. Yet in real life when things do happen, all these spoon-fed answer just didn't fit into the picture. I guess this is where faith plays it's role. *sigh*
