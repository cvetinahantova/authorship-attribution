Today's devotional from Unto the Hills with Billy Graham is entitled  Behind the clouds    This is the paragraph that I highlighted out of this devotional as it applies to my life.   " Many times I have sat on our rustic front porch and watched the clouds below.  I have thought of the clouds of discouragement and suffering that temporarily veil the sunlight of Gods love from us.  Many people live with a cloud hanging over their lives.  Some may be in hospital beds; others are suffering discouragement and bereavement.  A heavy cloud hangs over them."  I believe that would accurately describe where we are at.  We as in our family.  Katy and I are painfully aware of the passing of time with regards to our new angel in heaven.  Jessica has been gone now for five months.  As much as I might try and forget it I can not.  The memories are just too fresh.  The emotions are too raw and the memories too poignant to even put them to words.     James Moffitt Jesus Connect Ministries http://www.jesus-connect.net jcmoffitt@jesus-connect.net
