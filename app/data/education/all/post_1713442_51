urlLink 3rd Annual Lilly Conference on College & University Teaching - North  Well, I am off to this conference later today.  I will be at it until Sunday.  I may miss a day or two of blogging depending on if I have Web access or not while I am there.  This looks like it will be a good conference.  I get to present at the first session on Friday so I will be able to relax and learn right away.  My family is coming with me.  As Julie probably would find Traverse City confining by herself with two small children, a family friend is coming as well.  The four of them should be able to find fun and interesting things to do in Traverse City.  This should be a good trip.  We are staying at the Park Place Hotel.  The ad for the place says that it, "recaptures the spirit of times gone by â€“ the days of simple elegance, when courtesy and etiquette were synonymous with exceptional service."  We will see if this is hype or not.
