“Love is not a fire to be shut up in a soul. Everything betrays us: voice, silence, eyes; half-covered fires burn all the brighter.” --Jean Racine  Orestes, in Andromache  “Speak low if you speak love.” --William Shakespeare Much Ado About Nothing    B. conversation.   Before ordering that perfect speech pattern for your next luncheon, it is helpful to note that communication styles may vary.  Your host for example, prefers two of the trendier patterns.     Pattern one : an opaque and semi-detached style. But still, it is very user friendly and durable enough for daily wear.  He relies on this mode of conversation for everyone—everyone except you, of course.     Pattern two : a more translucent, flowery style rich with sensuous adjectives, nouns, and verbs. Equipped with specialized volume, tone, and intimacy control, this pattern allows easy access to all comfort zones.   Pattern  two  can be especially effective when discussing close friends, and “poetry, music, beaches, and dancing.”        It is best to keep in mind that  pattern two  is just for you alone, and is subject to change. If your best friend has unintentionally snubbed the two of you for lunch, he might suggest in a very soft and slow voice, “We should tell her that I packed a picnic, a picnic of.......of fresh fruits...........a baguette.......a bottle of wine......and some cheese...”  Never mind the fact, that your best friend does not drink wine, nor does she have a strong preference for the very romantic foundations of French cuisine.  As usual take the necessary precautions: hands free of all sharp objects, and air passages clear.  Also, you might want to avoid his extended gaze after the word, “fruits,” should your lips begin to quiver. As an extra precaution, place one hand directly over your mouth and turn your face slightly to the left, focusing on the NO SMOKING sign located on the back wall.  Should your best friend arrive at the next luncheon, and he happens to tell her, “last week I planned a picnic,” with a smile meant for you, do not be alarmed when the traditional French food transforms into “Just goodies.”  Certainly, your best friend already knows what he said to you last week, but a true friend is curious if he will, in fact, reveal the contents of the picnic once more.  After pressing him with a suggestion of, “Chicken or??”  He will simply reply, “Just goodies. I wanted to bring goodies,” while looking at you intently. Under such circumstances, you may forget to wonder what happened to the fruit, cheese, wine and bread.    If your host finds himself in a tight situation, where he must make a rapid shift from  pattern two  back to  pattern one , he should be able to do so with relative ease. While the two of you are discussing your reading of Mario Vargas Llosa’s, “The Secret Life of Alejandro Mayta,” and you happen to reveal that you do not exactly care for the author’s style, but you find his vivid description of Peru’s beaches, and mountain towns quite stirring, you can expect your host's immediate proposal of “I’d like to teach a class like that, you know, on Latin American music, poetry, beaches and dancing,” to be equally arousing.  Be sure to smile, agree, and insist on being in the class so as to reach full dotage capacity.   But should your sociology professor abruptly interrupt the conversation as an uninvited guest, he will make the switch rather gracefully when he explains, “I was just telling her that I need to teach a class on Latin American culture...”  Again, while he is speaking, expect his eyes to remain solely on you and through you as if he is all too familiar with the very corridors of your soul.  However, be mindful that you are now in the presence of unsolicited company; try to remove all excess of red from your face, and do cool down with a sip of tea or diet Pepsi before turning to greet your guest. After all, you don’t want your sociology professor thinking “History is your favorite subject.”             And always remember: “Speak low if you speak love...”               Next--guests: guess who is coming to lunch?
