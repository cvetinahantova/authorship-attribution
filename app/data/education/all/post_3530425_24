A depressed day, for reasons I can't quite put my finger on.  Dark thoughts, but more often, no thoughts at all, just a dragging sense.  I hate days like today--I get nothing done (and they seem to occur when I have much to do!).  This is a job for  Therapist Man!  whom I will see on Wednesday.  While things are working out very well with Juan on a one-to-one level, his personal life is in such disarray that I'm not sure how to respond.  His not-yet-ex-wife has moved back into their house, so they and their son are together again.  She doesn't know he has a girlfriend, but I can imagine that when she finds out the shit will hit the fan.  I've enough experience in divorce to know that there are two sides to their story, and I would not like to be her.  Is it homewrecking if they're living together, but not sleeping together?  He was physically separated, had been for several months, when we met a few weeks ago -- does this change everything?  He says he can't afford an apartment...  Maybe some of this is what's on my mind...
