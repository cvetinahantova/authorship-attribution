Good night out by all accounts. Cat and I went into London tahn to enjoy our last day off together before she heads off on contiki.  We went shopping, then went to wagamama for dinner (chicken ramen, yay!).    After that we went to Hillsong which was amazing - I just love feeling so connected!!  I may actually pluck up the courage to go alone next week.... Then after the service we headed to not one, but two Walkabout bars, and had a good night.  Quite a bit of totty around, including a rather tasty young man named Mike from home I got a kiss.  And then bolted, 'cos after all, when there's only two in a group, pullings a wee bit out of order.  So we got the train home.  And I'm absolutely knackered!  Current music:  Shania Twain - From This Moment On (ah, the joys of web radio during the wee hours of Sunday morning!) Current mood: tired, tipsy and happy Last person spoke to:  Cat and our taxi driver! Next: bathroom and bed.  Zzzzzzzzzz
