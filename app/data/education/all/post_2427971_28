You'll find that when there's more "interesting" things to read on my Blog it'll be considerably late. I go a whole lot deeper into my thoughts when I'm dead tired, strange and sorta inconvenient but otherwise pretty "interesting". So even if I want to type(like now) I can't always be effective at it. Also, if I lose my train of thought everything goes, I can't get anything back. This sucks especially when I have a lot to say, the only thing the produce this annoying piece of crap event is the GOD DAMNED TV of which my brother is watching. Well dam, it just happens so that my brother if FRICKING WATCHING IT RIGHT NOW! Thank you Andy, stupid little crap. I'm staying up from now on just cause I like falling asleep when my head hits the pillow better than sitting there for a few hours thinking about whatever worries I've got. That then will make it easier to make those long ass posts that make sense only to me and the ones I explain them to.  My new semi-favorite things are now water, salt and ice. Why? Try putting the three together in a certain order, any more and I'll give it away. First one to figure it out is special, not sure how many people know what they do. But if you already know then it doesn't count, so very fun. Oh wait, another clue... Zen! Good luck with it, if you even attempt it!
