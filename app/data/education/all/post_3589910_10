We have moved now. I haven't been able to write since the phobe line hasn't been tranfer yet. I'm at my sister since she's on vacation and I can use the computer while she isn't home without her complaining.  My new house it's nice. I love the backyard. I've sleep great so far. Everything is perfect except for the fact that the tempetures are so high that at night you feel like burning. I have to go to sleep early so I can use my sister's big fan while I fall asleep. Phoebe is giving me a headache but she's ok here. We have to put a small fence so she won't run to the street. I actually have nothing else to write for now.
