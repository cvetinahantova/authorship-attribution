so, just spent 4+ hours working on analysis in the graduate lounge with leigh, colleen, scott, and eric... and before that a couple with leigh and colleen, and inbetween a couple hours just by myself... got 3/4 problems figured out and i'm just writing up crap for the last one...  when it was just leigh, me, and eric, i worked well with leigh and got things done... eric's been stressed and kinda sour all week on account of the talk he's giving friday in number theory seminar... so when scott and colleen showed up to work on the last problem and i got confused i went to the table eric was working at and we started to discuss the problems i had done with leigh that he hadn't done yet... and inbetween instead of paying attention to what everyone else was trying to solve, we goofed off and laughed a lot.  one silly thing we did was we made pros and cons lists of being in grad school... i started to fill out the cons side, and then eric took the sheet and wrote out the pros side for me... his list went like this: eric learning eric cool people intellectual stimulation eric pizza seminar eric couch in the common room career advancement eric new york graph theory eric chuck (our grad director) eric  given, eric's a little (i take that back... a LOT) in a very weird mood this week, but we both laughed our heads off once he gave me back the list.  anyhow, so apparently i have pizza, career advancement, and eric as reasons to be here... forget math tonight though, i'm watching what i recorded of scrubs and going to sleep.  night.
