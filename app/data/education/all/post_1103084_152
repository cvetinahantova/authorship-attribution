its a snow day.    for me too!  it just feels like this huge gift has been given to me.  TIME.  This from the guy who doesn't believe at all in time...  who calls watches "institutional handcuffs"  and who is convinced that the invention and perpetuation of societal belief in "time" is the conspiracy of some folks who are trying to KEEP US DOWN.  (that's right.  the "man")  in any case...we've wriggled free for an afternoon and evening.  I'm off to frolic in the snow and sleet...
