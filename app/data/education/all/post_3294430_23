i met with a motorcycle accident on monday last. i was with my fiancee at that time.thank god, we escaped with abrasions from road burns. my bike was totalled...gone... and will need at least 10000 dollars in repair.i went down to kendo training with my injuries on wednesday and was given the green light from peter sensei to sit down and rest. my fiance was with me throughout the training session. she looks interested and she said she is confident in being able to do what the other female kendokas are doing. she thinks she might give it a try. well who knows i might be training with her soon? (the accident reminds me of director "beat takeshi", who had a motorcycle accident too. director/actor zatoichi.)
