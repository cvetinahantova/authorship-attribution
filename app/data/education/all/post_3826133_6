I can post what I intended to post this morning before my soap box took over.  (I'm still on it, btw, I just need a few minutes to be 'regular' Kathryn Rainne and not "SuperHero" Kathryn Rainne.)  I miss normal life.  Life without drama.  Life where Headder can come over and play cards without Rish calling and stealing her from me.  Life where my (s)Mother respects me as a person.  Life where things are good simply because they are simple.  Last night was near perfect again.  Monkeypants came over and worked on his resume (finished it, as a matter of fact!  I'm so pleased!) and The Little Dictator and I went to bed.  I read.  An Orsen Scott Card novel, but not science-fiction.  He's fabulous.  Headder stopped by until she was needed elsewhere and then Monkeypants and I fell asleep together.  Near perfection.  Seeing as how Monkeypants hasn't found a job yet, I'm going to start packing this weekend.  I'm looking seriously into Austin.  Everything is so expensive everywhere, though.  I guess I'll just wait and see.  The Little Dictator is feeling better.  She ate some dinner last night.  She would have just eaten candy if I had let her.  ;)  Worked on the poetry today.  I think I've a strong chance of getting it published.  Once I get it all together, anyhow.
