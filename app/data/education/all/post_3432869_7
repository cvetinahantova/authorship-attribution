Today I spoke with Amy, another fellow JET and Madisonian.  We have agreed to get together and at the very least, practice our primitive Japanese.  Who knows, maybe we could become friends and I will have another place to visit in Japan?  From what I hear, there are JETs from other interviewing locations who have already received their placements.  Where is mine?  Those of us from the Chicago group are still hanging in there, waiting as patiently as humanly possible.
