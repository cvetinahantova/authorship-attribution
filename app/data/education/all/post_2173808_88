The most recent  urlLink WaPo-ABC News poll  has to be encouraging news for the Bush campaign.  The last month has to be one of the worst for Bush since he came into office--gas prices are at historic highs, the 9/11 commission and Richard Clarke raked his administration over the coals, and all Hell broke loose in Iraq.  Nonetheless, Bush actually went up in the poll.  Last month he trailed Kerry 42 to 47, but this month he's back on top 47 to 42.  That's a net swing of 10 points.  Plus, he's now leading Kerry in just about every issue area. On handling the economy, last month he trailed, 53-41, now it's tied 47-47. On Iraq, last month it was Kerry 48-47, now it is Bush 52-41.
