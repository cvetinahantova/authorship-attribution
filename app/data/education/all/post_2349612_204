so i paid the bills i needed to, and then complained to ben about how bored i was... his solution? "hey, let's go see a movie!"  he convinced me to see "van helsing", which i had planned to avoid, but he saw a chick flick with me last time, so i figured i'd be brave and go along with one he was more excited about... on the whole the plot was good, i just freaked out every time a monster jumped out... even if the music hinted one was coming =P... however, unlike how ben hinted there would be claw marks on his arm just in time for when he starts teaching next week, he was wrong -- i just hide from the screen when i don't like it =P  anyhow, now i'm waiting for dave and the other dave to get in... i'm guessing at least another hour to wait... so it goes.  later dudes =P
