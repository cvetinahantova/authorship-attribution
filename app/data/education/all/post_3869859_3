A fun evening tonight; a bunch of Ellen's friends and I started off by playing some Frisbee at the Stanford Oval. Then we headed over to the Dish and hiked around the loop by sunset-- we stopped and found a geocache along the way. (#97!) We followed our strenuous (ok, not so much, but we did burn some calories!) hike with a scrumptious dinner at Darbar. (Third spicy meal in a row, following a Mexican lunch today (during which, for the third time, I didn't have lunch money when Victoria and I went out!) and Thai dinner last night!)  When I first met up with Ellen at the Oval, she gave me a big hug, but I gave her a small one. We didn't hike next to each other, and we sat at opposite ends of the table from each other at dinner. I felt her quiet presence, and I didn't feel the need to be any closer than that. When she brought us all back to the Oval, I could tell she wanted more, but I headed back almost right away. (Oddly enough, finding a loaf of bread on the roof of my car! What is it with food and my car-- first Jello on the back, then white bread on the roof?!?!? Crazy Palo Altoans!)  I've made excuses not to see her this week because I had a weird feeling about the intense relationship that was developing. Tonight, however, I enjoyed very much since I felt the pressure was off. We enjoyed each others' presence. I think I like her much better as a friend. If something more develops from it, then that's fine-- I think we just need time to get to know each other.  I don't really understand how dating works; it seems like it's a process of getting to know each other. But there seems to be a great deal of pressure attributed to it. But then again, maybe it's just Ellen?  Her friends were cool, though, and I look forward to hanging out with them again!
