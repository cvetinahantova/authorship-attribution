The June Sun   last night was the night you cried and i ponder why, ol' may you offered the eternal fountain of youth despite of my fears  that i am not young man anymore, but you made my day i now know why you brought yourself to me the ever tears your purpose was to create a brand new path for new june time to open the sky for yellow star to burst and burn me tan come, my sun; will you shine me and i will be browned soon i look forward to say goodbye to o fair spring and make a plan  to welcome you, the new summer on twenty-first, and embrace the earth's meadow will be greeniest with your hot rays of sunlight for i walk on a colossal field of beautiful grass and oh my grace you seed the new life of the beloved flowers and it is a delight  that you have the power to provide vegetative offerings and love for i offer my respect for you, the june sun, and i heed you above   ~kekua june 2004
