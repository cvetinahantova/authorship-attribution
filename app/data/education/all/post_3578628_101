Okay, as his neighbor, I feel like I should be the one who lets people know.  The people next door aren't going to be living here very long.  Andy's brother Kevin called here and said that he was going to school in Mishawaka this year.  Which means... Andy will be back.  For some reason, I thought Andy wasn't in touch with you guys so I wanted to see the look on some of your faces when he just showed up.  Because I know the look would be a happy one.  Well, I just got done golfing and I didn't have much sleep last night.  I am really tired plus I hit some awful shots.  Like I don't care if you aren't very good, I hit some that were just incredibly bad.  Well, Later!
