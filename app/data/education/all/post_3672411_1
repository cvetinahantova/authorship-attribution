After having watched the original  urlLink Fast Times at Ridgemont High DVD , I must hail to the chief that is  urlLink Cameron Crowe . He's like the grandaddy of the young person's character film. I challenge any John Hughes fan to duel with me over that one...  Thanks to Lauren and the good folks at  urlLink Shoppers Drug Mart  for giving it to me.  The thing that strikes me the most about Fast Times after watching it a few times again with commentary is how gritty it feels. Contemporary teen movies just look plain lame in comparison...I think this too about the original  urlLink Degrassi Series  when compared to the slick looking junior high series Disney and Nickelodeon are so guilty of.     So apparently the new DVD has all the deleted scenes in it, which i would love to see. However if I ordered it I would have the VHS, original DVD and rerelease DVD. That may be overkill, even for me.
