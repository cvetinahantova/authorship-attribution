So that was a very long gap.  The thing about everything is that your good intentions and admirable desires get squashed by real life issues such as doing a PGCE and having lots of work, being a lazy toe-rag and being lent my brothers game cube.  But with the luxury of a little time, coupled with the fact that its too cold in my living room right now to go and play or watch TV and that I haven't the money to go to the pub (being a poor student) I shall re-contribute and get a little self indulgent.  I'll try and be a little better at it in the future.  Went to see City of God a while back.  A fantastic film with a lot to say about things like violence, gun culture and two thirds world things.  A good analysis of it can be found at  urlLink fish.co.uk   The film gave me a new understanding of living a full and vibrant life within a fallen world.  It celebrated excitement, growing up, love and life while at the same time forcing the viewer to come to terms with the grim realities of poverty and crime.  And the disco scene is one of the best pieces of film making I've seen in a long time.  Very Good.
