well im  back in whittier after a couple of days up north at amanda's parents house. fun times, took a little detour on the way back and chilled in santa barbara and ventura for a day. drove by your house jesse and everything looked great. no broken windows or anything suspicious. it was fun. i love being able to drive into a city i have only been to a couple of times and still know how to get to where i am going. pretty quiet around here though. sycz working, the gloyd's in hawaii, dbah in northern california and the band on tour. im feeding the cats and watering the plants too. my busted up foot is doing better and my toe nail finally came off last night. i had to help it a little bit. you can all see it when you get home. sycz should be sending me photos he took of it when it was at its worste last  week anytime now... cough cough. anyway hello to all those of us serving overseas and those on the road earning their $10 a day for the sake of rock and roll
