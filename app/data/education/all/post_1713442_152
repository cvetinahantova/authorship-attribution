urlLink ALA | All Users Are Local  Another good looking online seminar from ALA.  Announcement:  Registration is now open for “All Users Are Local: Bringing the Library Next Door to the Campus Worldwide," a three-week online seminar from ACRL, February 2 to 22. Participants will learn how to design a plan for library support of distance education at their institutions. The course is designed so that activities completed along the way result in a planning document to guide future program development.   Walk away with the tools to create a comprehensive plan. By the end of the seminar, participants will be able to complete an institutional self-assessment on current involvement and future plans for distant education; assess current library support and set future goals; identify staff and funding needs and sources for future support; identify current and possible future features of a library’s website for faculty, students, and staff at distant locations; and analyze administrative, design, and content issues with regard to their impact on the library’s website.
