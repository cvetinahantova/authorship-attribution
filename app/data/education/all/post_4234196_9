It is now the end of the 8th period of the first day.  We did the straight schedule today, with each class coming in for 45 or so minutes.  Tomorrow, we start the modified block, with the odd-numbered period classes coming in for 88 minute blocks.  We will actually start doing schoolwork tomorrow, such as establishing login accounts, emails, etc.  Mr. Jewett had me conduct the class for 8th period.  It was a 7th grade Computer Skills class.  I went over all of the lab rules, etc. and was talking about the agenda for the semester while Mr. Jewett took a phone call.  Unfortunately, all of the stuff that I covered was wrong.  The agenda for the class does not include typing skills, even though I said it did and does not include PowerPoint, even though I said it did.  I think I confused the poor kids, because Mr. Jewett then came in and said, "hey, we don't do any of that stuff!"  I looked kind of dumb, but it went pretty well, for the most part.  Seventh graders, especially in the last period of the day, are kind of dazed and confused, anyway.  Mr. Jewett is off to football practice.  I will be taking off as well.  My first day as a teacher, done!
