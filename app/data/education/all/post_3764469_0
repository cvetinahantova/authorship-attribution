What do you do when you're bored at work, Megamall is only a couple of blocks away from your office, and your boss scoots off after lunch? Why, be the first in line to see  urlLink the new Spider-Man movie  of course!  So I saw  Spider-Man 2  during my lunch break (which took almost four hours). To borrow the term we used in high school for sneaking out, nag-ninja ako. (I don't know what I love more about the term, the way it uses 'ninja' as a verb, or just because I think the word 'ninja' is inherently funny. Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!)  I thought I was off scot-free when, on the way back, the torrents came down and drenched me all over. Back at the office, everyone probably just assumed that I was stuck in the rains which was why it took me so long to get back. Still doesn't explain the presence of my new Spidey tumbler.
