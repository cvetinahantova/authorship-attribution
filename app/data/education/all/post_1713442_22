urlLink A Novel Understanding of Ecology   Here is a good article on using a book to get students interested in ecology.  I think this is a good idea.  What would be a good book for teaching about information literacy?  If you have a semester long course, there is no reason why a good book couldn't be used to facilitate conversations relating to critical thinking in Web and library research.  If anyone has any idead for fiction works I could use, please share.  The abstract of the article, "While it enjoins readers to embrace radically new ways of thinking about the land, Aldo Leopold’s A Sand County Almanac bids teachers in particular to identify and  develop means for encouraging students to better understand and appreciate the environment.  As a response to Leopold’s implicit call for papers, this essay contends that the genre of the novel has untapped potential to facilitate an understanding of the natural world and to kindle student interest in ecological issues.  Braiding together a discussion of Leopold’s philosophy, phenomenology,  and Bakhtinian theory, this essay presents reasons why the often-overlooked novel lends itself well to helping teachers achieve these goals."
