Ingram     The essential nature of Alzheimer's disease—losing your mind—terrifies everyone who has seen a friend or family member fall to its advance. Alzheimer's disease is devastating, and, despite great strides in recent years, still puzzling in its cause and mechanisms.   Some cases, fortunately few, clearly run in families and strike early; the rest begin later, but show an equally relentless decay of personality. For the minority carrying early-onset Alzheimer's mutations, the genetics are cruel and implacable: If you have inherited one of those genes, you will develop the disease. Yet the great majority of cases do not demonstrate such a clear inheritance pattern. Of this majority, some represent inherited genes that give a higher-than-average chance of developing the disease. Other cases arise in the absence of known genetic risk factors and show no hereditary pattern. What turns these genetic chances into reality? More important, what can we do to stave off the disease once a diagnosis is made?   for more...  urlLink http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/21886?fulltext=true
