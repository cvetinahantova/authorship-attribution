Check out  urlLink FutureMe.org   This has to be one of the coolest site on the internet, if not one of the best forms of therapy out there.  Just go to the website, and write yourself an e-mail to be sent to you a later date (A month, a year, 3 years)  I dunno. The way I see it is, whenever you're having a tough time with life, and all seems to be coming down on you like a ton of tonnes, it's hard to think that there ever could be a tomorrow, let alone a next year.  Writing to your future self helps you think about what's to come further down the line.  Will this break-up that's haunting you still matter as much? What about that fight with your best friend last week?  Will you even remember what the fight was about a year from now?   It's all about perspective sometimes...
