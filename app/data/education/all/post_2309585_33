Well, V-day wasn't too bad. Andy and I slept in, then he took me for a late lunch at Olive Garden, during which it started snowing. So, we walked around the mall for a while, then walked outside to see it REALLY snowing, and decided to head back to town. It was really slick and hard to see, so we ended up doing 45 all the way back home. It wasn't snowing too badly there, so we went to Hastings, where Andy bought me a copy of  Greater Tuna , featuring the original Broadway cast. And, that was about it.  The snow sure was pretty. First snow we've had all winter.  I'm getting a lot of homework done lately. In fact, I've started scheduling times to work on my homework to make sure it's finished early. Yes, you may call me a nerd now.
