Have you ever done a Google search for the words "last page of the internet"?  Try it sometime.  It's absolutely hilarious.  There are TONS of pages out there claiming to be the last page.  Most of them encourage the reader to then go out and do something productive with their time.  I did find one, though, that linked to the "first page" so you could start all over again.  Yippie!  :oP   My favorite, though, was this one:   urlLink http://www.robrob8.com/news/last_page.htm    It's just another sign that people have way too much time on their hands.   Of course, this is coming from a girl who goes out and looks at them and then writes about them on a webpage that it's very likely no one is reading.
