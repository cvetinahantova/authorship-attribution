Check it out. This  urlLink guy  owns the moon  yeah,  urlLink this  is pretty crazy  well, I told my boss that i will probably be done at the  urlLink Valley Press  by October.  I had applied for a job at the Sturgis Journal, a paper in Michigan, but it fell through. I just want to get back home for a while anyways, so i suppose i could take a temp job. I am in limbo. I am waiting to hear back from  urlLink inetwork  about getting a job there.  I should find out sometime in november. I'd like to head back home after jason and jen's wedding which is on the 27th of Sept. I could have a month or two back there.  It wouldn't be bad.  they have some cool microbreweries in Kalamazoo Such as:   urlLink Bell's   urlLink  more Bell's   urlLink Olde Penisula   urlLink Corner Bar   urlLink Kraftbrau   if the inetwork thing doesnt work out, i will backpack in asia. c'est la vie.
