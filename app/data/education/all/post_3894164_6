Democratic Gain is finally upon us. I have chosen to participate in this series of workshops for many reasons. One it would be good to gain the knowledge of how to run a campaign, two this will look very good on a resume, and three (the most selfish of the reasons) I want to go to the JumpOff party this Sunday night at the Avalon nightclub on Lansdowne street next to Fenway Park. There are supposed to be a lot of celebrities there, such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, Al Sharpton, Terry McAuliffe, Jerry Springer, John Stewart, with music by Biz Markie, and the X-ecutioners.  Gain:  Field Organizing: Contact voters directly Identify those that support you  The Field Plan: Keep it simple Be creative Be flexible Detail your activities. Include a timetable: Time-Date-Location of all activities. Measure your success with specific goals. Hold it and your organization accountable. Share the document with your staff Always, always, always do trainings for staff and volunteers Keep your resources- people, time, & money in mind when writing your plan.  Understanding the Dynamics of the race and campaign: ·        What is the role of the staff? Do you need to increase your name recognition? How much time will you spend persuading undecided voters? How massive does your GOTV (Get Out The Vote) operation need to be? How much of the budget will the field operation have to work with? Will there be paid phone bankers and mail? What are the office space needs? How much is available for GOTV? Know the process & laws. Can people vote by mail or absentee?  Vote Goal: Minimum amount of votes needed to win. Expected Vote ______ x (.50) + 1 = amount needed to win  Comfortable margin of victory Expected Vote ______ x (.52) = amount of vote  This is a WAG (Wild Ass Guess)             Vote goals are based off of prior elections. Don’t know how many people will actually show up on Election Day. Targeting:             Democratic Base Voters Will always vote for you. Get them to the polls maximize their turnout and involvement.             Persuadable Voters                         Ticket splitters, move to Dem column.             Republican Base Voters                         Will not vote for you don’t waste time courting them.  Base Vote + Persuadable Vote = # of votes needed to win.  Don’t target A, B, C, Target D (Persuasion), E (GOTV), F (2nd Persuasion)   Always Vote Dem Swing Voters Always Vote GOP Vote Always C D B Vote Sometimes E F B Vote Never A A A/B  Staff: Field Director Volunteer Coordinator Core Constituency Vote Director Voter File Manager Early Vote/ Vote by Mail Director Regional Field Director Field Organizer Phone Bank Coordinators Precinct Workers GOTV Workers Outreach: What core constituencies will you reach out to?
