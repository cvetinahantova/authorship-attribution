The document also said the CIA and FBI were investigating a call to the U.S. embassy in the United Arab Emirates in May 2001 'saying that a group of (Osama) bin Laden supporters was in the U.S. planning attacks with explosives'... Bob Kerrey... said the memo's details should have given Bush enough warning to push for more intelligence information about possible domestic hijackings. 'The whole argument the government used that we were focusing overseas, that we thought the attack was coming from outside the United States -- this memo said an attack could come in the United States. And we didn't scramble our agencies to that,' he said. Richard Ben-Veniste... said the memo calls into question [Condi Rice's claim that it was] a 'historical' document." http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4700899/
