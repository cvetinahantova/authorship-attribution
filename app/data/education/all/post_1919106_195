I wish more people would pay attention to that. It'd save techies like me a lot of trouble. But ohh no, they had to go with the cheap solution. And now my parents will have to get used to using Linux, because I am not going to put Windows on  my  hard drive, which I bought over 7 years ago, and still works like a charm. It's a good old pre-suckinness-era Quantum. Go me! Well, I  was  thinking about installing that  Ignalum  distro I heard about today on Slashdot, but in the end I figured that I'll stick with good ol' Debian based stuff, and have my parents use OpenOffice, Firefox, and Thunderbird instead of MSOffice, IE, and Outlook. And if they fuck something up, I can give instructions to them over the phone to set up port forwarding on the router to give me ssh access and then I can fix it remotely. Ain't  that  nice? Anyway, I'm going to bed now. I've been driving for 5+ hours... Today I took a big turn around Toronto instead of having to deal with the traffic downtown. The good thing is that it took me about the same time, and I saw some lovely landscapes. The bad thing is that I put an extra 5 miles or so on my route. Well, it's still better than stop-n-go traffic. And the amount of rolling hills brought forth a good number of  WEEEE!  and  WOOOO!  moments.
