Yesterday was a great day in Halifax.  I met a person I desperately want to know... first time since I moved here, really.    I was fucking around yesterday afternoon with my friends A & M, taking the day off school to drink beer and play foozeball because A just defended her Master's Thesis yesterday morning.  After hitting Mexically Rosa's for a well deserved margeurita, we played some fooze at Dooley's downtown.  From there, A decided she wanted to visit Freak Lunchbox to buy some special treats for us all, and I almost bailed at this point to get some work done, but it was A's defense day, so she was princess for the day  Good decision, mac mommy, good decision.  So, Jake is working the counter, and he is attractive.  Just my type - very alternative, emo...love that.  First, while I was perusing the bulk candy at the back, Jake squeezes past me and touches my hip unneccessarily in the process... I am not averse.  Then, he turns to me, and takes my totally by surprise in the best sort of way... "Are those Royal Elastics?"  "Yeah, they are"...that is what came out of my mouth instead of, "Uh, yeah...do you want to have babies together?"  I was sooooo impressed.  If you don't know what Royal Elastics are, they are shoes that are so cool, only about 20 people on the planet know how cool they are.  The only reason that I own such shoes is because (a) I am a media hound, including all forms, even ads and (b) I just had to have them, so that I ate kraft dinner for a week in order to afford them.  2 years and $200 later, I am not sorry, because they have found me my future boyfriend.  Gawd, do I want to know this person.  And Jake is an aquaintance of A's, but she can't be the go between since she is leaving for UBC in about a week, so I will just have to deal with this on my own.  Any suggestions?
