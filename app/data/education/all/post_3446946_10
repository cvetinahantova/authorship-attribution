Well folks, I’m having a wonderful time in New York. It’s big, and kinda dirty, and the humidity is horrible, but it’s a lot of fun. I’m blown away by all the Jews. I still feel like a minority, but at least I know I have plenty company. It’s fun seeing other people with kippot. I ate at a kosher restaurant last night, and it was over flowing with people. Families, groups of friends, couples on dates, it was crazy.   I also hit the  urlLink Empire State  building yesterday, which was necessary. And in all honesty, I liked the  urlLink Sears Tower  better. Their was a better display of information to read about the history of Chicago and what you were seeing. Move the damn gift shop downstairs. Anyways, I’d come into Manhattan via the subway, and so when I stepped outside, I had no how to orientate myself. I’m trying to figure out which way is north, I’m looking at my subway map, I’m looking at the street signs, I’m looking at the tourist kiosk, and up at the buildings. But I couldn’t get oriented or figure out where the Empire State building was. Hehe, turns out I wasn’t looking up far enough. As soon as I craned my head all the way back, I saw it, a lance into the sky. I was a block away.   I’ve got the better part of today to keep exploring (Lower East Side, WTC, Times Square, maybe the harbor tour), but the fact is, I leave for Israel tonight. It’s starting to dawn on me again, but I’m going a long way away. Sure I’m excited. Of course it will be fun. And once I meet up with the rest of the group (I’ve already met up with Rachel and Charles) I’m sure I’ll be fine. But the fact is, right now, I’m a little unsure about this whole thing. Seems a little bigger then I’m used to. Pushing my comfort zone. Oh well, it’s a good thing.   My next post will be from Israel, so until then...
