So I just read an article posted on Jewishworldreview.com yesterday entitled " Arab Guide to the 2004 Election"   by Steven Stalinsky.  For those of you who've never been to Jewishworldreview, it's great.  Obviously, it focuses on Jewish issues, but has some great authors offering all sorts of opinions.  You can even read Jackie Mason there.  Anyway, I digress.  The article reported what is being said by the media in places like Egypt and Iran.  Basically, they go one about how the President is a Nazi,  (which is ironic, because all these coutries sided with the Nazi's in WWII) and that the US better elect Kerry.  Well, that's enough for me.  Unlike most who are afraid to say it, these countries are the one sponsering the people who want to kill ALL americans.   And that includes Muslim americans.  That fact that they want the President out, and are going over the top to try to accomplish that shows that the President's policys are working.  No matter what side of the other issues we may be on, taxes, welfare, abortion, whatever, to paraphrase David Ben Gurain, what good is the debate if we're all dead!
