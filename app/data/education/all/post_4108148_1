It seems like today was non stop running, or actually hobbling around in my case.  The high point was grabbing some good Chinese take out for lunch with R at the Holy Wong, which is my favorite take out place in the D + F area.  This afternoon, I bounced between work, the laundromat, and my place trying to get stuff done, so I can feel like I am getting ahead.        I forgot to mention this previously, but I saw a great trailer by V for a doc she is doing about gay and lesbian weddings in the New Paltz area.  If I can find the URL again, I will have to post it.         A couple of interesting things I noticed while going around D + F earlier -   1) The Village Limits neon sign is gone, and now there is a new neon sign that says Valentine's.  It will always be Village Limits to me.  I have so many good memories of that place.  Remember the times we would guess how many mullets we could see in one night?  How about the Fish doing his thing to the Cha Cha slide on the stage?  Could I ever forget the time when Salim hit on two girls that were dancing and he then got invited to their wedding?  ...K-Lo dancing on the bar at her 21st b-day while she was wearing a huge yellow foam cowboy hat that had her address on the side of and said If found please return to.   The great numerous happy hours there for the free food.  I recall the time Gman got yelled out by Junior because he thought G was a Dolphin's fan.  All the times with TJ, Steph, and Mel D were awesome too.  Village - we will remember you!  RIP Village Limits.  2) Arby's In Fredonia no longer offers baked potatos!  This truly bothers me for the fact that Vegetarians should be able to eat unhealthy fast food and suffer the consequences of ill health just like their carniverous counterparts.  I wonder if this is a regional thing or national thing. On the topic of fast food, I am hoping to catch SuperSize Me at the Opera house this weekend.
