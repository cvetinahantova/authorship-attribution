Though i'm jealous of all those PDAs i see on the street or in school, if he was to do that, i'll run away.. I guess it's cos i'm not used to it.. I'm a very practical person so is he.. That's the problem.. He doesn't make me feel like a princess for a day.. haha.. We don't celebrate V-day, birthdays.. But i remembered celebrating our 1 year anniversary.. He was so sweet.. Brought me to a park where we spent the time talking..It was so quiet and romantic... That date was the best  (the only date!) .. Lolz..It's as though we're married already and all we care about is buying groceries, getting food on the table and making babies..  Why can't we be like track 2 or track 9 of Jay's new album... Sweet.. I always feel like i'm in track 6..  Thanks ppl for listening to my woes...
