Well not much new.  I found out Michelle's site isn't dead instead it is alive and well.  For some reason I thought it was done for.  Needless to say I'm very happy it isn't b/c now I have something else to read in my hours and hours of free time.  Here is a little something to do for you guys.  Go to google and put in "weapons of mass distruction" and then hit I'm feeling lucky or whatever that button is.  Then read the error message.  Pretty funny stuff if you ask me.  Braves managed to live another day.  They'll have game 5 tomorrow back at the Ted.  I really hope they can pull it out but I'm a little worried.

I bit the inside of my cheek really hard today while I was chewing bubble gum.  That's all.
