hey all,  well i got a compliment from one of the other teachers today.  she told me i did a good job keeping the girls in line.  it's a big problem at st. joe because most of the girls are rich little snobs.  they've never had to work for anything and they have awful attitudes.  well most not all and it gets worse as they get older which makes the compliment even more meaningful because it was grade 10/2 which is the final grade.  it really made my day.   it's kinda sad how i go about getting them to shut up.  all i have to do is threaten them with an english assignment and they go completely mute.  which is amazing since they've been studying it since they were six.  unfortunately st. joe tends to teach through handouts and vocabulary lists as opposed to conversational or any other style that makes the girls actually have to think.  anyway... everything else is going great.  i'm starting to fall in love with bangkok.  oh! also, i just found out that i'm getting a week off in july the 12-16 or something like that.  they just bothered to tell us last week.  the farang teachers are always the last to know everything. very frustrating.  right now i have plans to go to the beach or i might go with vicky to hong kong.  ahh!! so many possibilities.  i'm so excited.  we always have a good time together.  well i've gotta run.  hope ya'll are stayin' cool down there is mississippi.  love ya, jane
