oh my god....this is so rockin'!  yesterday, jammi and i talked for the whole afternoon. it was fun. mostly, we talked about narcotics. it was pretty cool actually. man, he knows a lot.   but... something so unbelievable happened afterwards...something JP and i used to do. this time, it was different. there were no words. just heavy breaths. no moans, just asking whether were ok or not every once in a while. too bad my bro arrived already. god, i never thought we'd do that...i'm kinda glad we did...heehee  this morning was cool, too. i woke up and slept again for a little while. i dreamt that i was in my grandpa's house and jammi picked me up. i rode a car which his older bro [i think] drove. we were seated at the back and i held his arms so tight it felt so real. but then, my bro was making some noise that i woke up. gosh.....
