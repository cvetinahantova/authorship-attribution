I swear I just saw the scariest TV commercial in the history of modern television. I honestly have never seen something so horrifying.  THE QUIZNOS COMMERCIAL!  That commercial is so messed up! It makes me want to hide under my bed and never come out. Those gerbils need an orthodontist, and must NEVER EVER SING AGAIN! It is such a freaky commercial. It's honestly the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.   But at the same time, it's also the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. :-)  We went to our second CATN rotation, and now I have Agriscience. It looks incredibly stupid, and I hate bugs so I don't know what I'll do. But the greenhouse is really really warm so it's not terrible or anything.   Other than that...not much...
