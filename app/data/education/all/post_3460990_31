I'm here. Tired beyond belief, but here.   My flight, which I left for at 5 am this morning, was delayed by an hour. Then, with the miracle of air travel, we "made up" the time in the air. That way, I made my connection and landed in Austin around noon.  My Mom looks worse than I had expected. She's lost a lot of weight, and can't really get out of bed. Stephen, of course, is the biggest jerk in the world and is making every process harder than it needs to be. Bonnie was going to take the kids over to her parents' tonight, but has reconsidered and is going to take them in the morning. Shelby has been a terror all day-to the point where I locked her outside to get her to stop screaming her head off.   I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I know that I  can , I just don't know  how . Sometimes I wish I could curl up with someone nice for a while and just let myself melt into them.
