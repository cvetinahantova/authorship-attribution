Big winds now.  Just heard the fire guard has been breached in two areas - one of them is Curlew, the street mom lives on.  Winds are supposed to stay until around 10 pm. We have more smoke in the air now than any other day, if that's possible...  Ernie and Jens have been moving big stuff out of the house all day and getting the motorhome ready to travel just in case. He took Angie's drumset and our guitars over there as well as my boxes of photo albums and other important business papers.  Right now, we're heading back over to the school and pick up 25 boxes of binders and evacuate them to Jen's.  We will probably have to change the workshop venue but I'll worry about that on another day.  What do you take when you evacuate?  What's important?  My heart has been pounding all day - a constant adrenaline rush.  I wonder how long you can survive at that level?
