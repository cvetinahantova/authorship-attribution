I went bike riding with Shelb today. Meh...  Then I came home to make a scrapbook page and I found all these old photos of where we've been and where we've lived. I saw the photos of Alex and me in Scotland at the Guy Fawkes Bonfire parade thingy...photos of Puerto Rico after Hurrican Hugo...photos of Iceland and Germany and when my dad went to Luxembourg (sp?) to see where his family was from...stuff like that. It was really cool. Kind of mind-boggling since America is so boring and wrapped up in itself and I just don't like it here.  " I've been all over the world, I've seen a million different places... Right through the crowds and all the faces... I'm still out there looking for you. "  I still have Sunday School tonight, too...
