So, December is next week, I have a whole £8 in the bank and I have not bought one single Christmas present. Tomorrow, thankfully, pocket money will arrive and I will be able to try desperately to find the time in between schoolwork, jobwork, Guides, going to my dad's and spending more than an hour at home at any one time to attempt to find presents for people. Thankfully, this year's list of big-pressie-people is not that long:  1. Mum £10 2. Dad £10 3. Em £7 4. Bev £7-10 5. Philip £0- Mother took out and insurance policy and got a free watch 6. Selina £25 7. Lucy £9 8. Oli £15 upwards- shirts cost money!  If I have the time or the inspiration, I will try and get some smaller presents for other people. And Liz's birthday present. Oh, and I suppose I'll have to get something for Wicked Stepmother aswell...  On top of alllllll this, I am absolutely shattered, therefore grouchy, and have PMT, therefore totally miserable, self-pitying and very, very horny. Grrr.   Thankfully wonderous events such as JYF, Hell Is For Heroes and Good Charlotte are approaching, all of which include seeing men who I either find strangely attractive or come under the category of FIT. But between now and then I will continue to drown in a sea of work, more work, irritability and... did I mention work?  Ceff x   Things can only get better...
