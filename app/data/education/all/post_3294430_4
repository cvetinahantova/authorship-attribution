training was a killer today. we moved our training sessions to the court upstairs. knowing the humidity and heat, i was sweating buckets. one point during training i had to stop, ask peter sansei for permission to leave the dojo to vomit. he once said that training would be hard and if we needed to vomit we should do it outside the dojo. it would be a hassle and also disrespectful to do it in the dojo. i did exactly that, felt guilty of leaving the class momentarily.i vomited and then asked permission to join the class again. i felt better after relievinng myself so i joined in again and suffered more horrendous torture after that.
