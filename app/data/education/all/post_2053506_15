I got my summertime tea swap tea in the mail today.  Wonderful teas!  Since it was a summer themed swap, lots of the teas are supposed to be yummy when iced.  There are a lot of peach, lemon, fruity, and green teas. Those types of teas do make me think of summer.  I had a lemony jasmine tea this morning.  My throat has been bothering me, and this was the perfect thing for it.    I have been brewing iced tea with green teas.  I find I like my green iced tea a bit on the strong side.  I made a pitcher earlier and tossed it because it was weak.  This batch is good.  It's made from Revolution Teas' Tropical Green Tea.  I taste mostly green and some light, light, citrus taste.    I will have to be making a new batch soon, and I will probably just reach in and see what I grab.  I drink more iced tea during the summer months.
