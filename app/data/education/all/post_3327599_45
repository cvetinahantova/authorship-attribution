sooo today was a lazy sunday. and it wasn't because i wanted to stay home. mom decided she wanted to have a family day because she never sees me.. umm hello! we'll be spending a fun filled 10 days together in new york! and every state between here and there.. hopefully i can get out this week and do some stuff with friends before i leave. and i can't take my cell phone with me so if you absolutely need to get ahold of me.. your s.o.l.. you'll just have to hope that i call you. if you stand on your roof and yell really loud i just might here you. i did go to reasors today.. since when is Brooke Mauldin called "Tony"? i've been in there serveral times and it has always said Tony, that is just strange to me..   so i really don't have anything else to say about anything. the weekend wasn't too bad and i get off of work for 3 weeks which is ok with me because i don't really like this work thing.. i just like the money they give me lol.   and the most exciting thing that happened today!! Jamie McMurray (#42) came in 2nd today in cali!! i was sooo happy for him! he soo could have kicked Jeff Gordans ass but i think he was just trying to be nice and make Jeff look not as gay.. good job Jamie! you're so sweet. as for you Jeff.. you should have run out of gas you gay rainbow warrior freak!
