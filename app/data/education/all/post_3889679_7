First post today.  Have just eaten chocolate for both breakfast and lunch, so will no doubt have to go forage for food soon.  Cannot believe this weather - hailstones in July?  I have no idea what I'll wind up writing about in this blog, but hopefully it'll get interesting.  Off to London now, so better change out of my towel.  Current music: some rocky pish on radio 1 Current mood: apathetic! Last person I spoke to:  the lovely Kitcat Plans: shopping, Hillsong and the pub.  And more time online naturally.  I'm such a geek!
