To Grandmom's house I go...  Yes, it's been far too long since I visited the wonderful place that is  urlLink Grandmom's . West of Port Angles, it sits on the bluff overlooking the  urlLink Straights of Juan de Fuca . I’ll be there from Saturday afternoon (I know, I’m rolling on Shabbos, but the rest of the weekends are booked, and I want to see Grandmom before I go traveling) until Monday midday. I hope to get some resume work done and the possible general writing. Not to mention some reading. It’ll be good. Hope you all have a nice  urlLink holiday weekend.
