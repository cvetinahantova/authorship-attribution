Phenomenal Woman -Maya Angelou  Pretty women wonder,  where my secret lies I'm not cute  or built to suit a fashion model's size But when I start to them them They think I'm telling lies.  I say It's in the reach of my arms the span of my hips the stride in my step the curl of my lips I'm a woman phenomenally Phenomenal Woman That's me.  I walk into a room Just as cool as you please and to a man  the fellows stand or fall down to their knees Then they swarm around me A hive of honey bees.  I say It's the fire in my eyes and the flash of my teeth the swing of my waist and the joy in my feet I'm a woman phenomenally Phenomenal Woman That's me.  Men themselves have wondered what they see in me they try so much  but they cant touch  my inner mystery when I try to show them they say they STILL can't see.  I say It's the arch of my back the sun of my smile the ride of my breasts the grace of my style I'm a woman phenomenally Phenomenal Woman That's me.  Now you understands just why my head's not bowed. I don't should or jump about or have to talk real loud. When you see my passing it ought to make you proud.  I say It's in the click of my heels the bend of my hair the palm of my hand the need for my car. I am a Woman Phenomenally Phenomenal Woman That's me.
