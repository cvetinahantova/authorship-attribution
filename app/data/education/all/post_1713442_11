urlLink Slayage: The Online International Journal of Buffy Studies   As most instruction librarians know, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a great TV show for teaching about information literacy.  How many shows (especially ones that last for seven seasons) feature a librarian as a main player and show research as a regular component of real life?  This online journal is for serious academics who are using Buffy for tenure and raises.  There is some excellent stuff here I noticed as I browsed through eight back issues of the journal.  It also has information on an upcoming Buffy conference in Nashville.  I doubt I will get funding to go to that even if I can get a paper accepted.  I was thinking of a title like, "And the Word Became Flesh: Dawn, Glory, and the Use of the Avatar on Buffy the Vampire Slayer." But I am probably just a Buffy scholar wannabe.
