The ex is improving about calling the little one when she's with me.  He's already tried twice this summer.  One more week till we go hide out in my old home town. Tomarrow and Saturday is the huge yardsale.  I wonder if there is really going to be anyone but us.   Talked to my sister today.  She's having a hard time dealing with her husband's teenager.  She's never been quite sure how she fits in, having only been married to him for about three years.  It's fine when his kids aren't around, she's just not sure about how to handle the lack of disipline factor when they do show up.  That's were my ex's wife has it easy.  She got in while my little one is still young enough to assume that all adults must be respected equally.   Though you got to wonder how complicated things will be for them when the new baby gets old enough to realize that my little one gets cards and packages from me all the time. I wonder if they will favor him trying to make it seem more equal and there by only upseting my little one.  It will be a tricky situation for them. I have been very tired today.  I think it's something in the air, because both me and the little one took a nap today.  Not the usual occurance.
