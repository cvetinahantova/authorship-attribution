Wow!  Today was quite a day!  While trying to be a good mom and take my boys for one last outing to Six Flags before school starts I was involved in the scare of my life!  Scott, David, and Scott's friend Jeff, and I had been at Six Flags all day and had a ton of fun even though it was very hot and humid today.  We had to leave at 3:30 due to Scott and Jeff being due at a party (that's a blog for another time....not quite ready for these high school parties), so we decided to ride just one more ride and then go.  Jeff and David opted for bumper cars while Scott and I just wanted one more roller coaster ride.  We hopped on the Flashback as Jeff and David went to the bumper cars right next to our ride.  The first part of our ride was fine, but then, as we were totally on the top, almost flat on our backs, VERY HIGH IN THE AIR, the thing jolted to a stop!  At first I thought it was just going to stop for a second and then go, but as the seconds became a minute, I realized that we were stuck!  And as I looked down below, there stood David and Jeff and all I could think about was that I was going to die on that thing and my little son was going to see the whole thing!   Bearing in mind it was 101 degrees and I suddenly had to go to the bathroom, I began to panic just a bit.  Scott, on the other hand, was having a ball.  He said it was the best part of his day.  Finally, after about 15 minutes (which is a LONG time when you are stuck on a roller coaster) they got it going again and all I could do was pray that this time when it stopped, we would be on the ground!    Thank you, Lord for getting us off there safely!!!
