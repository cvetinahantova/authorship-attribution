from: brett mills sent: tuesday, march 30, 2004 11:00 pm subject: my adventures part 8    Nothing much to report this week.  It has been 2 months since I landed in this beautiful country.  I am still enjoying myself and I feel really at home in Gifu.  Although I am still thinking about moving to Nagoya.  We`ll see what happens.   I passed my probation period, so that means more money and still no stress. I love saying that don't I.  Sorry for all of you back at home who are stressed out right now reading this.  Went to Karaoke on Sunday night with about 20 other people for a couple of teachers that were leaving.  It was lots of fun, everyone singing actually screaming to a heap of different songs.  I have been working and sleeping mainly this week.  I love sleeping in when it is cold and the weather has been a little rainy so even better for laying in bed watching DVD`s.  Speaking of DVD`s, I have now stuffed my computer, it will only play region 2 DVD`s, which means I can only watch Japanese movies.  So when I get home I wont be able to use it.  I know someone at work who is going to have a look to see if he can change it.  Oh well It`s OK for the next 10 months anyway.   I bought myself a stereo system for $90 which is great because I can now listen to music instead of watching TV that I have no idea what is happening.  I am probably going to a nice park on Sunday, which will be good as it is the start of the Cherry Blossom season.  I will be taking lots of photos of that.  Cherry Blossom season also means lots of festivals, and hopefully that means free sake in the sun again.  YEAH!!!  Well that's about all.  Short and sweet just like the Japanese girls.  Hope you are all Genky (happy)  Chat later Bretto
