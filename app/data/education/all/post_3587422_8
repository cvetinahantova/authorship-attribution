To show how cheap and poor I am I have only seen two (2) movies this entire summer although I plan to see the PG rated Napoleon Dynamite tomorrow. So without further a do I give you my movie reviews for the two movies I have seen all summer:  Anchorman (PG-13): This movie was down-right hillarious. My friend John and I along with couple of our other friends went to see this movie for the first time for John's birthday. I found the movie very funny. I had the whole theatre laughing when I yelled whammy at the top of my lungs when the guy gets hit in the balls (you have to see it to understand how funny that was). Anyway the storyline was rather random, but Will Farrel can put a smile on anyone's face.  Final Grade: B  I, Robot (PG-13): I, Robot stared Will Smith in a futristic robot based movie. The movie was based in 2035 I believe. The movie was about a robot company gone bad. When a computer named VIKI goes bad and plans to kill every human with evil-powerd robots Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) and Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) are put to the test batteling the evil-powerd robots and destroying VIKI. Well long story short VIKI is of course killed by detective spooner, as predicted. The movie overall wasan't as intriguing as i htought it would be.  Final Grade: C+  That's It For Now Stay Tunned For Tomorrow's Episode starring Napoleon Dynamite. I'm Andrew Nus Signing Off. So Long America (Online).
