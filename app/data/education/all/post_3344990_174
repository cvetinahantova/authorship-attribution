I received this article from Rick Schatz because I am subscribed to his newsletter. I agree with everything that is said in this article and want to use my BLOG as a place to SHOUT IT FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOP......  I have always said that we live in a REAL world with REAL PROBLEMS and we have a REAL SOLUTION and that solution is Jesus Christ living within me.  I have always said that if the CHRISTIAN community would stand up and RAISE their voices and say that ENOUGH is ENOUGH that the secular world would HAVE to listen.  That does not always mean that the world is going to change its wicked ways. What it DOES mean is that our voices will be heard and the world will have yet ANOTHER opportunity to choose righteousness over wickedness.  How will the world KNOW that what they are doing offends God IF we as Christians sit back quietly and say nothing.  Apathy and cowardice in the face of the majority will NEVER change one single thing in this world.  I have also said that the church as a whole is apathetic and complacent because the church is not willing to DO WHAT IT TAKES to make a difference.  Sometimes making a difference means to sacrifice something. Those things can include time, talents, money, power, prestige, popularity and our own private security zones we like to stay warm in.    I am thankful for organizations like this one that are willing to do what it takes to be heard.  I stand behind what they are doing.    God bless        From: Rick Schatz, President and CEO Date: 02/03/04 11:54:23 To: james@jesus-connect.net Subject: MTV THUMBS ITS NOSE AT PARENTS       WELCOME!  IN THE NEWS  MTV THUMBS ITS NOSE AT PARENTS DURING HALFTIME SHOW  MTV's halftime show was a slap in the face to parents and youngsters across the country, said the National Coalition for the Protection of Children & Families.  "The last thing a parent expects to see when they sit down with their family to watch the Super Bowl is Janet Jackson's breast," said Rick Schatz, president and CEO of the National Coalition.  "The Super Bowl provides a unique opportunity in that it can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. To feature a halftime show that requires parents to send their kids out of the room is unconscionable."  The Super Bowl started out with a beautiful tribute to NASA and the space shuttle astronauts who lost their lives a year ago but it went rapidly downhill with the halftime show.  Parents who gathered to watch the show with their kids were blindsided not only by the baring of Jackson's breast but also by the freak dancing, crotch grabbing and sexualized lyrics of the music.  "CBS clearly made a very poor choice in having MTV design and produce the content of the halftime show," Schatz noted. "The MTV ideology is clearly aimed at promoting a sexualized lifestyle to teens. This time they got the chance to do it on broadcast television instead of cable."  Even the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission called the incident a "classless, crass and deplorable stunt." The commission has already agreed to launch an investigation.  The National Coalition will be polling its constituents to get their feedback on the halftime show. In addition, the organization will be focusing on informing parents about what they really get when they pay for MTV in their cable package.  Please let us know if you watched the halftime show and what you thought of it. Please send us your comments at ncpcf@nationalcoalition.org.    KUDOS TO ABERCROMBIE & FITCH FOR CLEANING UP ITS ACT  The National Coalition for the Protection of Children & Families has officially called off its boycott of clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch.  "We've seen some stunning developments at A&F," said Rick Schatz, president and CEO of the National Coalition. "Not only did they retire the 'magalog' in December but also they have unveiled their spring clothing line without resorting to the offensive, sexualized messages of the past."  Schatz has been in conversations with A&F's Director of Investor Relations and Communications, who assured him that the clothing company had dramatically changed its marketing methods.  "We've seen evidence on A&F's web site and in their stores that things have indeed changed," noted Schatz. "The people spoke, the company listened, and it has done the right thing."  The National Coalition launched its awareness campaign against A&F on Nov. 10. By December 6, the company had retired its "magalog," which was filled with nudity and text that promoted risky sexual behavior.  More than 30,000 people signed the National Coalition's online petition or called to express their outrage. A&F's in-store sales dropped as did their stock, and they received an abundance of negative press.  Schatz added that A&F's decision to change the way it markets clothing to teens and young adults underscores the fact that when thousands of concerned consumers speak with one voice, they can change the culture.

MICHAEL CRAVEN DEBATES ACLU AT UC BERKELEY  Michael Craven, the National Coalition's vice president for religious and cultural affairs, debated representatives from the ACLU on the subjects of homosexuality and same-sex marriage Jan. 28.  Before a visibly hostile crowd of 600-plus students at the University of California, Berkeley, Craven presented the sociological and historical perspectives regarding not just homosexuality but other matters of moral truth related to sexuality.  "What I saw was a generation of young people who are desperately interested in knowing the truth," Craven said. "And I realized that what was important was not simply to win the debate but to demonstrate the light and love of Christ."  Despite the unbalanced nature of the debate, Craven's attempts to present reasonable and rational arguments for marriage between one man and one woman didn't go unheard. He was approached by more than 30 students at the close of the debate, all of whom disagreed with his position but were moved by the calm and compassionate way in which he spoke.  "I realized how important it is that we focus on people, not just the issue," he said. "When we reflect Christ's own grief and compassion for those who don't understand truth, then we can impact their hearts."
