Dear Journal,            I haven’t gotten that letter in yet; maybe today’s the day to get it in and done.  I’ve kept pretty busy this weekend, with cleaning and all.  But once the day is done and the beauties sleep, my mind wanders off.  I roam into the past, the future, what could have been and how it’d change my life as it is now.  I wonder how my reply letter to Donnie should go, or if I should let it go at all.  I miss him nearly everyday as the father he is and can be to Jonny.  Sometimes, though,  I forget to hate and despise and dislike him and find myself missing him for what he was to me.   I will always love him; we both know that to be true, you and I.  But whatever, if any, type of relationship we ever have again, it’ll NEVER be what it once was.
