urlLink SecurityFocus HOME News: Wardriver pleads guilty in Lowes WiFi hacks   Runt ro, its not nice to steal credit card numbers EVEN IF they are floating through cyberspace on a wireless connection.  I guess these folks just drove themselves straight into a federal penitentiary after being STUPID....  I am glad they were caught...  Keep an eye on your Lowes credit card statements for any fraudlent activity.  Maybe Lowes has figured out how to implement some security on their wireless network now that this story is out.  LOL...  Silly people....
