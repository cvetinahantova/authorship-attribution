Well, u kno how i told u about the sun night at my house with ellie, when we were talking to tony and tony. Well we were down in the basement and i was about to let my cats inside when i saw this huge opossum eating my cats food. I completely flipped out. I took a window curtain holder which is metal and starting jabbing at the oppossum and trying to scare it away. Ellie scared me more and said that it attacked ppl and it can eat through wood.  So i was freaking out. I swear if i saw the thing once more i would faint or thow up or something. I was so scared cuz it was eating all this and it just looked at us and stuff. I dunno why i should b so scared but i was. I've only seen an oppossum twice in my life and the first time  i screamed so loud the neighbors asked us what was wrong and the second time i just told u what happened....well tata for now
