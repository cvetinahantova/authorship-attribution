I'm watching outside the lines on ESPN right now.  They're airing a really interesting story about the Nashville Sounds - a AAA team affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Apparantly, 7 times this season, they are having something called "Faith Night" at the ballpark.  Faith Night includes bobble head give aways featuring Moses, testimonials from Sounds players, as well as performances from Christian bands.  All of the ongoings aren't actually on the field, but on the concourse outside the stadium.  This, obviously has generated a great deal of controversy, especially since attendance nearly doubles on Faith Nights.  The Sounds admit that it's a good business move, but also think it's good for fans.  I have a real problem with these faith nights.  Religion shouldn't be about making money.  Now, I understand that they are helping people, but usually minor league teams are a part of the community.  The Silver Hawks are.  If the team wanted to sponsor a faith night and not associate it with a game, I think that would be awesome.  But making money and giving away caricatures of Moses?  Faith isn't the only thing on their mind.
