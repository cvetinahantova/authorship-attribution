Quizzy   Well,  urlLink the Jung Typology Test  is not as fun as the ones Tracy posts on her blog, but it definitively is insightful. I didn't feel that the post-analysis by  urlLink Keirsey  matched my personality a lot (there were bits and pieces that I could relate though,) but the analysis by  urlLink Butt  nailed it. The best thing about the Butt link however is that at the end it also gives neat information, such as famous people of your type (but  why  did I have to be of the same type as Descartes?! Well, at least Henry Mancini is someone I don't mind, and it was funny that I got to be of the same type as Jung - the one who created this test,) and suggested relationships for your type.
