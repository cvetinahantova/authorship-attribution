watching kendo is not fun. for the past two weeks i've been at the dojo for every training session. with my injuries i could not join the class eventhough i wanted so much to be with them. i still cannot sit  in seiza position and sonkyo is very painful. i've made my mind to start on wednesday and peter sensei was kind enough to allow me  to seat cross legged during seiza. i will be with them wednesday and my kiai will echo in the dojo once again.
