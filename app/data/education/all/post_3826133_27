Yesterday was full of super ultra highs and way down dirty dirty lows. (I'd like one day of normalicy, please.)  As we know from yesterday's post, the morning was brilliant and shiny. Just the way I like my mornings. At some point after lunch, I slipped into a deep and terribly damp dungeon. Not how I care for my days to go.  (s)Mother has run away from home. No, really. My Mom has run away. (And she doesn't understand when I drive aimlessly around town.) I'm secretly stashing cash for her and now she's run away. Not joking. Seems the problems between her and Mito are only getting worse. I'm worried and frustrated and unsure how to help. Then I realized that I've lost my pay ticket for this month's house payment. They won't send me a new one without Gramma's social security number. How am I suppose to pay this? Gr. Stupid Washington Mutual. I had to tell Christabelle that I won't be in Dallas this month. She cried. I miss her so much, but I'm going to see her soon. Hell, I'll be sending her an invitation, soon. But I'm getting ahead of myself.... Things picked up again after work and I took Lia to the grocery. Yea. Now we have food. I took Monkeypants dinner and flowers. He nonchalantly said the killer nine words which devestated me, broke my heart, shattered my very breath:   I'm going to spend time with the boys tonight.
