This interesting note from  urlLink Truthout :   As many of you may know, William Rivers Pitt recently took a break from Truthout to lend his hand to the Dennis Kucinich For President campaign as a National Press Advisor.  We apologize for the limited amount of information we provided at the time.  Truthout is a non-profit, and we had to maintain a bright line between Will's work with TO and his efforts on behalf of the Kucinich campaign. Will now returns to TO as Managing Editor, and has finished his work for Kucinich. You can look forward to his clear, resonant voice of reason in the wilderness.  --  TO Executive Director, Marc Ash.
