here it is 12:32am (at least if you're in my time zone :-P), everyone else who actually belongs in this house is in bed and asleep, and here sits lara in the dark, typing away at the computer...   actually i have good reason for this... i've been on the road a week and roommate offered that i do my laundry for free while i'm here, so i started stuff up and i'm waiting for the dryer to finish up... blah.  anyhow, so i heard roommate preach tonight... since she's not ordained yet, she led the whole service except communion, then a visiting pastor from another denomination (united church of christ, which is in full communion with elca (roommate's kind of lutheran)) visited and led that part... only, if you're familiar with lutheran liturgy at all, he completely skipped the proper preface and recited the sanctus instead when the congregation normally sings that in response... he also held a card with the words of institution written on them so that when he actually picked up the bread and the chalice, he was one hand short and did strange things with them... it all worked out and he was really nice, but it was kinda amusing too.  while i'm on this church terms kick, saw a "what theologian are you?" quiz in another friend's blog who's in seminary (i.e. pastor school) like roommate is... here's my results:        "We reject the false doctrine that the church could have permission to hand over the form  of its message and of its order to whatever it itself might wish or to the vicissitudes of the  prevailing ideological and political convictions of the day."         You are Karl Barth!  You like your freedom, and are pretty stubborn against authority! You don't  care much for other people's opinions either. You can come up with your own fun, and  often enough you have too much fun. You are pretty popular because you let people have their  way, even when you have things figured out better than them.          urlLink What theologian are you?   A creation of  urlLink Henderson    the "You don't care much for other people's opinions either" i beg to disagree with, but the rest i thought was amusing. =P  so how about getting done with laundry and getting some sleep, eh?  p.s. "how to deal" gets 6/10 on the lara movie rating scale... "love actually" is for tomorrow morning.  night dudes. =P
