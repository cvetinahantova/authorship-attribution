We finally have dial up internet in our cabins so we don't have to drive an hour to use the computer anymore!  It's getting pretty late and we have a long day tomorrow so I won't write much.  Tomorrow we are going to Montreal to spend the day in the city and check it out.    Today was a good day.  Began with all of us girls doing an 8 mile bike/run.  Joey, mom, and Nicole biked, I ran.  It was pretty cool because we ran 4 miles to a bridge where the guys had driven the wave runners too.  We watched them drive around the water for a while (and fall off a couple of times) and then came back.  Chaz came really close to us and sprayed us with water - Joey and I got soaked.  So the whole way back we were really wet and we are trying to think of a way to get back at him.  Sometime during the next couple of days he is going to get a bucket of water dumped on him when he is least expecting it.  Then we went to a winery in the afternooon and it was awesome.  Did some wine tasting and ended up buying a very expensive bottle of an incredible dessert wine.  (It is half the size of a regular bottle of wine too.)  Don't worry our wine loving friends, Nicole and Chaz got a bottle too and if you're lucky me just might share!  Really though, it's the best wine I've EVER tasted.  It's called ice wine, and super sweet and the highest alcohol content of any of their wines.    Then we did our usual Euchre playing and ate yet another incredible dinner.  And I ate steak.  And it was so good.  Can you believe it?
