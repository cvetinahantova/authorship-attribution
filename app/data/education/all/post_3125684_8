Okay, so I've done the impossible.  I have become friends with an ex.  We talk.  I don't mind it anymore that she is with someone else (they are in the process of breaking up).  I am also with someone else.  A little more than "with."  I don't miss her as nearly as much.  I am happy.  More than happy, content!  I like that I am able to talk to her.  We talked this afternoon.  I wasn't on the defensive.  She wasn't pointing fingers although she did tell me that I can be evil and God bless T for trying.  Yes, God bless her indeed.  This doesn't mean that I'm going to be friends with all of them (plural of ex, exes?) now.  I don't care if I never speak to the others again.  Not because we ended on bad terms, but because I just don't give a damn.  Part of my motivation must be giving a damn in the first place.  There are orchids among roses.  She was an orchid.  Roses are far too common and ordinary.  Well, at least the red kind.  I prefer the peach roses.  I have closure now.  I am able to speak to her and not lust after her.  I've always been able to wish her well, but now well doesn't have to include me.  I spoke to her this afternoon about my latest orchid.  What do you do?  I sense that she is unhappy.  I've been feeling a little blah myself.  What must I do?  D offered no suggestions.  She said that it happens to the best of us lesbians.  Living with someone is different than dating.  D encouraged me to hang in there and learn what works well for us.  Can you believe that?  D of all people encouraged me to hang in there with the one who reigns after her.  So I'll sit around and think of ways to survive this stage of our relationship.
