Today is a pretty chill day.  I don't have any real plans, just walking around the city and seeing what there is to see.  Too bad it's so hot.  But could be worse, I'm from GA so I'm used to the heat.  I have sleep accomidations in for my train ticket so this is good.  I also got a refund for my bus ticket to Hanoi that I won't use which was unexpected but much apprcaited.  I just wanted to cancel my reservation when the nice nice lady asked me if I wanted a refund.  How cool is that?   I've been walking around most of the morning checking out pagodas and museums.  Nothing too special but gives me something to do.  I'm also on the hunt for some books in English but haven't managed to find anything decent yet.   I think I might find my motor bike driver from yesterday and get him to haul me around until I need to leave tonight.   I feel great seeing as how I got to sleep in until 8:30 this morning.  That's pretty darn good for this trip actually.  I'm worried I'm going to end up with some tools in my "room" or whatever it is called on the train.  With my luck I figure I'll have someone who snores all night or smells bad or something.  But at least I have a bed.  Man I swear, if it's not yahoo messing up it's hotmail.  Why can't I access both of my accounts at once?  Ugh.   I'm looking forward to Hanoi and Northern Vietnam.  I could spend at least 2 months here just looking around and taking everything in.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking to travel around SE  Asia.   Time to find some food and then figure out what else to see and do this afternoon.  See ya'll in Hanoi.
