This from the WaPo's  urlLink Ann Gerhart  on yesterday's adjoining Kerry and Bush rallies in Davenport, Iowa:   These are Iowans, after all, smug and secure in their disproportionate political power.   In other words, "Get me the Hell out of this dump and back to the people that really matter--those that live in my corner of DC."  Full disclosure notice:  I grew up about 40 miles north of Davenport in Clinton, IA.  To me, Davenport was the nearest thing to a big city.  They actually had a mall!  And having lived in DC, I'll take Davenport anytime.
