i just realized when i got home just now -- i was gone for over 14 hours!... dude  8-8:30am: woke up, got ready before amanda was up b/c she's not used to me being up til after she's gone on mondays  8:30-9:30am: caught up on emails, organized my stuff for the day  9:30-10:15am: ran by the bank, picked up eric, went to the local playhouse to buy tickets to see "cats" next week  10:15-11am: got omeletes at a local diner =)  i've been craving omeletes for awhile now. =P  11am-11:30am: unsuccessfully worked on algebra homework in the office with mike  11:30am-12:50pm: lie groups... completely lost  12:50-1:30pm: lunch in the student center with leigh -- i had indian food =)  1:30-2:30pm: worked on homework on my own in the office, waited in the parking lot until a spot close to the building showed up to move my car to for the quick post-analysis get-away with eric  2:30pm-2:50pm: had a good chat with jared and played wallball with my new sparkly bouncy ball against the chalkboard in the analysis classroom before anyone else got there =)  2:50pm-4:10pm: analysis -- dr. goodman snapped at me when i told him i'd rather not have the final later than monday may 10 (i plan on getting outta town on the 12th)... that's the current plan now that we all voted  4:10-5pm: drove eric to class and fought traffic to get myself back to campus  5-8pm: worked on algebra homework with leigh to absolutely no avail  8pm-9pm: helped eric make a pizza, had dinner, listened to him vent for a bit (or as he prefers to say "connect with his subconscious" (this is rare... the venting, not the creative rephrasing, so it was interesting)), had a crazy theological discussion with trevor (eric's roommate) who had just returned back from a crazy just for fun trip to paris with his girlfriend (he just skipped classes for a week and a half for fun!)  9-11:45pm: worked more on homework, finished some, decided i didn't care on the rest and chatted with eric more in the grad lounge  11:45pm: finally left to come home and here i am... sooo tired, so much yet to write up tonight... the work never ends!  night y'all.
