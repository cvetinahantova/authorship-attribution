i LOVE sneezing.   it is one of the perfect human experiences.  if i were starting a religion, one of the ten pillars would have to do with how sacred sneezing is.  they expurgate evil fluid.  for some they spring from light.  they include uncontrolled feelings.  they demand complete attention.  they sew together the dialectic of profound felt experience with insistent public expression.  like spiritual insight, they are almost impossible to conjure or manufacture.  a fake sneeze may fool others, but to the faker, its just a stupid irrelevant replica.  ~
