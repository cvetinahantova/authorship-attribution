got to talk with my cousin about my niece jea yesterday. and i'm very happy with the way she's growing up... only two yers of age yetÂ she already knows the alphabet and different colors! and she speaks complete sentences already! from my classes, children around this age can only utter words or phrases...but definitely not my niece! intelligence runs through the family genes i suppose. haha!:D
