Right, here's the state of play.  I've got just under 48 hours, and the following things to do:  1) Make the concertina book 2) Watch some cricket 3) Hang out with Hav 4) Complete and start to send out our wedding invites 5) Sleep 6) Mount the remainder of my exhibition stuff  7) Watch England trounce the French in Euro 2004 8) Celebrate this 9) Sleep  No messing around. This time it's personal. This crazy-ass course is not gonna break me. I am a man of iron. I have a mighty and unbreakable spirit and I shall overcome.   Here I go.   Raaaahhhhh!
