The online world provides fertile soil for a wide array of new religious movements, especially  urlLink wiccan and neo-pagan beliefs . In this article, John W. Morehead of  urlLink Watchman Fellowship  points out that missions organizations have done a good job creating strategies to reach the world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and folk and tribal religions, but have done little to reach practitioners of these newer belief systems.  "[D]espite the continued growth and impact of these global groups and movements," writes Morehead, "little serious, concentrated missionary effort has been undertaken by evangelicals to reach this mission field." And those efforts have often been unproductive because of their focus on countering "cults." Most of those efforts "have focused on apologetic refutation of a given groupâ€™s doctrine as heresy in contrast to Christian orthodoxy. While an emphasis upon fidelity to biblical orthodoxy is important in order to establish clear doctrinal boundaries for the Christian community (1 Pet. 3:15; Jude 3), it might be argued that 'counter-cult' community's use of apologetic refutation as a model for evangelism has been largely unsuccessful."  Alas, far too often we attempt to replicate those same unsuccessful efforts in the online mission field. Morehead's excellent article, though a bit cerebral, offers an alternative way of looking at ministry to those involved with new religions.  Link via  urlLink The Ooze .
