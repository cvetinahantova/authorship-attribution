hello,  well tameron, the girl from south africa, was put on a different schedule  today.  st. joe had two people quit in one day.  tanya a science teacher  from australia quit because she got a job at an international school where  her three children can attend.  i think this is a good thing because she was  trying to home school them on top of teaching at st. joe.  also, ultan a  irish man with teaching experience is off to a different international  school.  he was offered 2 1/2 times the pay at st. joe so i can't say i  blame him.  now sister is on the hunt for more teachers but for the time  being i'll have all 30 kids.  honestly i didn't expect to have tameron for  too long, but i was hoping for a few weeks.  people come and go at these  school's all the time so a teacher has to be willing to be flexible.  other than that not much to tell.  i'm going to soi 4 with friends from  school.  that is one benefit of st. joe eveyone is cool and we enjoy hanging  out with one another even when we don't have to.  soi 4 in silom is a gay  area with great music and good drinks.  i'm looking forward to tonight.   it's fun seeing people from work let their hair down and party.  well gotta  run.  i'm off to the gym.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.
