i opened my mail today and found a really long and funny letter from reg, one of my features writer before with the lasallian newspaper, who's also one of my closest friends in dlsu.  gosh thank you for the delightfully long letter reg!  i really love the way we so openly talk about things..and even though i know that's how it's supposed to be with close friends, the understanding i have with reg is tremendously uplifting!=)now i need to find time to reply to that email of two URLs!!!
