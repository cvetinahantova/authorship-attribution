My boss, has hinted that he needs to do my return to work interview. I have requested someone else does it as I feel he does not beleive I was legitimately off. He has referred it to his boss but the request was turned down on the basis of it just being office banter! I started to write a complaint, but he aplologised, which meant I had to hold onto it, instead of submitting it.
