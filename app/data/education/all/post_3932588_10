Dear Teammates,               I went to a barbeque this past weekend, on July 17.  Everyone was asking me where Daisy was.  I felt terrible that she had passed away.  But I felt realyl peaceful in a way that I will soon be getting a new dog, thanks to all of your hard work.  Your commitment to this project is overwhelmingly generous.  Thanks to everyone that is working so hard to make my  new dog possible.   Much aloha.                    --Nancy Gorman
