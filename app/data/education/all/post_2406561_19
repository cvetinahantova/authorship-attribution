So. Efrain situation. Not good. In fact, looking overcasted, and downright stromy. Cries.  My letter was "intense". I do agree with that statement. WHAT? Did he expect me to write him a letter that says, "omgz EfFy i luvozrs u!11!!". Please god, no. I have to intense, dramatic, and bitchy.   BLAH. BLAH. BLAH. BLAH.  I swear though, he seemed to get pissed when I kept asking Matt for er.. help. Haha. Oops, bitch. Don't think for a fucking second that I can't turn the game all the way around, because I can. Even though Efrain constantly is submissive to all my motives, he won't back down on this one. Guess what? Neither will I. If I have to pull out  all stops , let it be. Honestly, I'm sure that Matt has a thing for me, and I can use it to my advantage. As well as Fransico, George, and about a bunch of 50 thousand guys that I don't seem to care for.   The guy that I do care for? Playing nice with Clara, and Jenisa. AH. I don't know whatthefuck it is. I swear, I'm getting as bad with swearing as him. dksfhgfdjkhgsdkjghsdfg.  Dies. Dies. STUPID EFRAIN. I LOVE YOU. I MEAN, WHAT?
