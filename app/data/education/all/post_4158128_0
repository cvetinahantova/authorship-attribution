I had planned on blogging about my trip to Cincy but in light of Tony's victory today at Watkins Glen, I dedicate today's blog to him. This was the second win of the season for him and in both cases, I was not watching the race except for the last few laps. I hope I'm not jinxing him by trying to watch every week. Anyway, Tony was suffering from stomach and leg cramps and was unable to attend his victory lane celebration. Hope you feel better soon Tony!!        Congratulations Tony Stewart and the #20 Team!!!!
