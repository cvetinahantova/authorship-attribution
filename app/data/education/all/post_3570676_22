Hi Guys~ I'm still a little lost as to what exactly it is we are supposed to be doing on the blogger site. So I'm just going to go along with what some of the others are doing. I agree that to use a blog in the classroom may be a little difficult unless it is an upper level class such as Jr/Sr high school. An idea on how to use one could be to have discussions on the blog as part of a weekly assignment. They could post their thoughts and ideas about the readings that they have been doing or any questions that they may have. I also really liked the idea that someone else had about the principal using blogs to communicate with teachers. That could definitely be useful. I think it's going to be interesting to see how these blog posts go! I'm looking forward to it. Keli
