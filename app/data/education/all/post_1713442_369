urlLink Helping Parents Prevent Lead Poisoning. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Binns, Helen J. and Ricks, Omar Benton.  It gives parents tips on how to prevent their kids from getting poisoned by lead.  From the ERIC Digest:  Lead poisoning occurs when too much lead gets into the body. Children are at greater risk than adults because children absorb lead more readily than adults, and a small amount of lead in children's bodies can do a great deal of harm. Lead can cause irreversible damage to a child's developing brain (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ATSDR], 1995; Bellinger et al., 1992; Dietrich et al., 2001). The effects of lead poisoning on children can therefore have a significant, long-lasting impact on learning and behavior (Banks et al., 1997; Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 1999; Satcher, 2000; Schwartz, 1994).    One measure of lead in the body is the blood lead level (BLL), measured in micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (micrograms/dL). Nearly everyone has a measurable BLL. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that BLLs of 10 micrograms/dL or above are cause for concern (CDC, 2000a). However, even at BLLs below 10 micrograms/dL, lead can impair development (American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP], 1998; Banks et al., 1997; Bellinger et al., 1992; Landrigan, 2000; Lanphear et al., 2000; Schwartz, 1994). This Digest summarizes some causes and effects of childhood lead poisoning and suggests some lead poisoning prevention strategies that parenting educators can share with parents.
