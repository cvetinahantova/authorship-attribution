Watched out Changing Lanes last night with Samuel L Jackson and Ben Afflick.  Very interesting movie.  Love how things connect back and forth and form a story.  Also watched Edward Scissorhands later on.  Thinking of the six degrees of seperation in my dvd collection.  Think the last Samuel L Jackson movie I remember seeing was Unbreakable, maybe its because I watch it all the time.  Actors I'm enjoying: Samuel L Jackson Denzel Washington Johnny Deep  I just seem to love the movies there in.  Of course I'm also a fan of  M. Night Shyamalan  Jerry Bruckheimer  Tim Burton J.
