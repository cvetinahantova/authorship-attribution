Hey, if I am going to dream, why not dream BIG.  How about dreaming the impossible??  LOL... Well, who knows, if we figure out how to play the lottery on a regular basis we will have a 1 in 5 million chance of hitting it big just like everyone else that plays.  Short of that happening this Christmas wish will probably remain a dream.  LOL...    I downloaded this image as my desktop this morning from Webshots.  If you are like me you do not like to stare at the same ole boring desktop day in and day out.  As for me, I use Webshots to refresh my desktop image every single day.    As you can see mother nature dumped buckets of water on us yesterday evening.  The storm was so bad Katy and I grabbed the dogs and headed for the center of our tin box.  Yes, living in a double wide trailer is NO FUN when you are listening to the lightning cracking all around you and watching debris fly by the windows when the wind kicks up a notch or two.  Living in the midst of a bunch of trees all around you also does not make things nice when the lightning starts to zing all around you.  I guess the only plus about the trees is that hopefully the bouncing electricity will hit one of them before it hits the trailer.  Then again, if it hits a tree close to us that tree will possibly land on top of our tin can causing a large dent.  All you can do is hide , squint and pucker and hope the storm passes by without killing you or the neighbors...        Katy just advised me that Justin and Kristina's neo pets were starving and that she had to go online to feed them.  I said "say do what??".  Katy is playing some sort of game on Neopets so that she can accumulate enough points to buy food for the neopets so they dont starve.  Gosh, I wonder if we can do that for the REST of the zoo around here?  LOL...  I am thinking, "dont we have enough critters to feed around here without having to have NEOPETS to tend to?"  @@  I guess it goes to show you that there are just not enough pets to go around....     My 18 year old son in Houston Texas (actually Richmond/Rosenburg Tx outside of Houston) started his first year of community college at Wharton University.  Wharton University is a community college close to where Jeremy lives with is mother and step father.  Mark, Jeremy's step father, has been working hard at making sure Jeremy got registered in college so now Jeremy can make the educational leap from High School into community college.  Way to GO Jeremy !!  Study hard son, you will reap the benefits of the hard work later on in life.  I was chatting with Jeremy just the other day on Hello telling him that I was hoping that he would NOT make the same mistake I did.  When I was his age I had the opportunity to get my RN degree at El Centro in Dallas Texas and because I THOUGHT I was smarter than my parents I decided that I would drop out (idiot) and be a real man and just make it on my own.  After all, my parents were incredibly short sighted and stupid and what did they know about real life?  Well anyway, there is more to that story than meets the casual observer here but the important lesson to be learned is to get that degree while you can.       I changed my imood this morning from blessed to SICK.  Yuck and double yuck.  My blood pressure spiked yesterday at work so I wound up coming home at 2pm to rest.  This morning I felt better in that regard but I spent most of the morning talking to mother nature.  I have been speaking with her so much this morning I feel as if I have a special relationship that will NEVER end.  I am hopeful that this ongoing conversation will eventually end.  I called my boss at Goodwill and told him of my predicament and that I would try to be at work by noon today but if not I will be there in the morning to greet all of our eager beaver retail shoppers as they rush through the door looking for used computer junk to carry home. (Cough)....   I am happy to announce that my friend John Searcy in Houston Texas wrote me an e-mail telling me that he has started a new blog.  John told me that something I said to him when we were all together for a JC reunion caused his creative juices to get flowing.
