I've got nothing so interesting as a picture of Okie, today.  Though I am seeing the new Spider Man movie this evening.  That will be a fun diversion from the ordinary.  Well, unless one counts seeing movies as ordinary.  Which I guess it is.  Don't I just know how to suck the fun right out of everything!  And then tomorrow, the work week ends at last!, and Lor and I head to Florida for a whirlwind weekend.  We'll be in  urlLink Celebration , the town created by Disney, paying loved ones a visit.  I dread the flight but look forward to the fireworks.  You take what you can get in this world, and certainly Disney Town will know how to light up the sky.  The heat down there will be brutal.  Thinking about it reminds me of good things, though.  The heat always ends, and Fall always comes.  The time of new beginnings, and air that isn't pea-soup thick with humidity.  Often Fall is ubearably tardy, and it's always too short.  But the best thing about the summer is knowing that just around the corner are crisp afternoons, falling leaves, and pumpkins.    Frequently, I flip the calendar pages ahead a few months and glance at the picture they have for October.  It doesn't matter what kind of calendar it actually is - somehow October always involves orange colors and cool skies.  Even, really, this one calendar I had as a teenager, which was entirely about cows.  The October cow had an orange border, and there were leaves on the ground by her feet.  Because of that calendar, I still think of August as "Au-cud-gust," incidentally.
