Last night after The Boy went to sleep, The Husband was applying for new jobs on the Internet. He said he'd written an enthusiastic cover letter. I said what did it say? and on the spot we made up the worlds worst cover letter. It sounded somethink like this:  Dear Sir,  I really want to work as your company. Last week we had company at our house and my wife made them dinner. So I would have my wife make dinner for your company sometimes. I will not come to work naked.  Sincerely,  Rich  We went on and on. We laughed so hard we woke up The Boy.
