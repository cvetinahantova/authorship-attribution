can i take back what i said in third?  i don't even know that the whole voyage of discovery thing is what bugs me.  what really bugs me is that these stupid movies are degrading to men. seriously, how many movies have you come out of saying, "man, i could definitely make it the rest of my life without ever seeing my wife or any other woman again. men are all i need. i can live a fulfilling life without the opposite sex. who needs Them, anyway?"  and yet, ask the woman you go to see these movies with. ask her how she feels about you after leaving the theater. you know as well as i do that you really don't even need to ask. you can see it in her eyes. disdain. scorn. "i have had an epiphany. i could definitely make it the rest of my life without ever seeing my husband or any other man again. women are all i need. we can form sisterly bonds and throw off the shackles of our hated patriarchal society. men are better off castrated. i can live a fulfilling life without the opposite sex. who needs Them, anyway?" can you see it? can you not?  i'm not talking specifically about alley, either. she's great. she loves me, and i think that most of the time she likes having me around.  i love her. i like having her around as much as is possible. i also recognize the fact that my life would be meaningless and stupid without her.  if i want a good life, which i do, i need her. i need her almost more than i even need my stupid self.
