It`s All About Change!       As I have mentioned in previous posts, March is primarily a transitional stage with no work and hours of keeping yourself occupied with random self-made tasks.  Well, March also marks a change...A BIG ONE!    Teachers here in Japan basically all have temporary positions at any randomly assigned school (or so it seems).  Then, after 4 years (average), teachers are shuffled and without fail, all the ones you really like are sent to another school somewhere in the prefecture.  So basically every year in April, new teachers arrive attempting to fill the places of those sent elsewhere in March.  At school today we had to hear the farewell speeches of 11 teachers/office people being sent away and now the staff room is quite lively with teachers moving all of their stuff to newly assigned desks in the staff room.  Luckily the ALT's don`t move.      I must say that as the ALT, you hear the list of people leaving and it`s quite a shock when all of the people who have really helped you are victims of the switch.  Unfortunately as well, the teachers you were hoping would be moved are still going to be here.  Anyway, tonight both of my schools are having their farewell parties (sobetsukai).  While I have spent the day at my base school (Teizan), tonight I will be going to the party for the boys school.       Without a doubt tonight will definitely prove to be a little bitter sweet.
