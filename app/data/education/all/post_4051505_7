just spoken to dad. she arrives tuesday and leaves saturday. i can not and will not stay at home next week. that's it, i'm going to live outside and at other people's houses. the reasons for hating this woman are as follows: -she sticks her great big hairy nose in where it's not wanted -she's impolite and has no manners -if she's left alone in the house she'll look through your room, searching high and low for incriminating evidence and/or anything she'd like to steal -she throws things at the cats...in the past this has included handbags, stones, food and mugs of tea -she is just plain ugly -she has disgusting eating habits and table manners -she smells like 'old woman' -she says i'm good enough to eat and tries to hug me -she wears weird old lady clothes -she doesn't appreciate the term 'privacy' -she likes nothing about you, and she lets you know it -she is queen of her world, and nobody else is good enough -she thinks i'm 4 years old -she treats me like i'm 4 years old -she's nasty -she can't miss her god damn soaps...if you come between her and her precious soap operas, you're dead -she eats a lot those are the problems i have with my grandma. and no, i'm not being picky just because i don't like her, the fact she smells like an old woman is not my problem, and it really is a design fault. i have a really fun week ahead...which reminds me, i have to buy a lock for my door so she can't get in and rummage through my stuff.
