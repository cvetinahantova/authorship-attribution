Just been to The (new look)  urlLink Ooze .  Very impressive.  I particularly like the  urlLink collaborative blog .   urlLink emerging church info  has an axcellent article about  urlLink Network Church  by  urlLink steve collins .  urlLink  The Dark  is soundcape built in complete darkness.  It looks  at the the hidden history of slave trade in this country and uses the imagery of ghosts to talk about past injustices.  It is interesting to on many levels, the history stuff of course, the way it uses new technology to tell old stories, the justice side and the way sound and (the lack of light) can be used to shape reality.  See all that and I haven't even visited it yet.  There is an  urlLink online version  (broadband required) but even better it is coming to  urlLink Magna  in Rotherham May 14th - August 27th.
