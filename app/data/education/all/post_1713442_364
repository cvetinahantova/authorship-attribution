urlLink Constitutional Law and Race-Conscious Policies in K-12 Education. ERIC Digest.     This ERIC Digest is by Angelo Ancheta.  It reviews law and how it should impact racial policies in schools.  From the ERIC Digest:  Nearly 50 years after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the racial integration of our nation's public schools remains elusive. With the growth of immigrant populations and the movement of families from cities to suburbs, race relations have become very complex; the minority student population of many school districts is now the majority, and it is composed of three or more racial and ethnic groups.    Despite the mandates of Brown to desegregate schools with "all deliberate speed," many school districts that were once under court order to desegregate have been released from their obligations and are experiencing problems of resegregation (Orfield & Yun, 1999). Voluntary efforts to address racial isolation--efforts that are not required by a court or a settlement agreement--have been challenged as unconstitutional. Policymakers must grapple with the growing complexities of race and an uncertain legal landscape that may, ultimately, preclude the use of race-conscious measures in K-12 education.    This digest examines the constitutional framework that guides the use of race-conscious policymaking in K-12 education. Despite the requirements of Brown, recent court decisions suggest that desegregation remedies are becoming more limited and that voluntary policies will be subject to greater scrutiny by the courts.
