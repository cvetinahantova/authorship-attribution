In this blast program i have learned many intersesting things.Stuff that i have learned in science are how to measure.By doing this we used a straw  and gum to  cover it up. In math  every week we get in groups of three and start working in different kinds of problems.Its really fun working like that.In poetry we have written poems about lives and after that we are able to share it by reading them out loud.In writing we have talked about college and we have written questions of our own to see how college would be when we get to it. Right now we are supposed to write an essay about the questions that we have done. Our group name is THE FUNNY GURLS and our group question is Will College Be Part Of Our Future? My own question was Will College really make me successful? For me i think college is really important.College will lead you the way to success.I think that it will be part of our future.This can happen if you try your best on everything and if you really want it to make it happen.Nothing will work by itself.You got to make it happen.The only thing u got to do is to never give up.  We also have spanish class.On the  first class we just played a game called loteria meaning bingo. The fieldtrips had been fun too. Our first fieldtrip was at Washington Park it was kind of fun because we got into groups and started doing activities on how real life experiences are. So we had to help each other and work together as a team.On the second trip we went to lincoln park zoo. We diferentt kinds of animals. We also took pictures of success. Taking the pictures was an assignment of writing class.    From the blast program teachers all i got to say is they are all great. They help us on what we need. I have never experiend a Program like this before.
