HI It's been awhile. Just been  taking a break  with work and enjoying my time with Sergio's sister and her son. It's been great. I am glad yesterday was my last day of this semester. I won't go back to school until August and I only have 7 more weeks and I will receive my credential. I am going to start my Masters program that Spring. God willing everything works out.  I am writing because  yesterday  as I was driving home, I drove by that church that I was going to check out. They were having a college youth bible study and worship night. I met some cool people and everyone was welcoming. This church is culturally diverse something different from the church I am currently attending. I am still praying about this and trying to figure out more about this church. Well see what God has at this church. I am planning to go again next Wednesday at 7:30pm.  Now  I am going to pick up Sergio's sister because she is comming over for dinner. I made some enchiladas, rice and beans and bought a cheesecake. I hope they enjoy the food. We are also going to go watch the movie Shrek 2. My friend told me that it is pretty good. God Bless all of you and once again thanks for your prayers.
