Wilson, B. 1997, Reflections on constructivism and instructional design   Wilson's article is a very refreshing insight into the debates and perceptions underlying instructional design. What strikes me is the prevalence of content related issues which to me sums up my dilemma of supporting learning objects and trying to figure out the constructivist approach to learning.  Wilson quotes,  'You have put your finger on a fundamental difference in approaches taken by those who believe that instruction can be designed to teach knowledge and those who believe that knowledge is constructed by learners....I would go so far to say that the two positions are irreconcilable.'    Although he continues that reconciliation is not really impossible, but his position does reflect on my views on instructional design as well. Personally, I have my doubts about construtivism. It seems to apply only to students able to muster independent thought with adequate knowledge pre-existing (as Moodie suggests). But with the focus of flexible learning being the ability to address large student numbers suggesting that undergraduate programs and lower will be of greater relevance, the adoption of a constructivist approach might alienante a lot of learners.   From Wilson's elaboration, there is a certain justification for constructivism. At this point, I feel like I have to decide on which approach to adopt. A lot more reading will be necessary for a more formative judgement to be made.   This reading reflection is still incomplete but will be returned to after I get some sleep :)
