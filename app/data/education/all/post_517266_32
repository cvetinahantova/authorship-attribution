Hannibal, MO - I am in the home town of Mark Twain and The Unsinkable Molly Brown who was on the Titanic.  I spoke today to the middle school, high school and then tonight to a group of parents.  Overall, a very good day.  The schools were amazing with great auditoriums - which makes all the difference.  Today's visit was sponsored by the C.H.A.R.T. Teen Task Force.  Great day.
