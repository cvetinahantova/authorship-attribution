So, all day now, my running commentary with myself has been focussed on this one phrase from the novel that I just finished reading. The novel is  The Watsons go to Birmingham - 1963  by Christopher Paul Curtis. It's about an African American family from Flint, Michigan, and the story moves from the eyes of Kenneth, a ten-year-old boy. Anyways, once they reach in Birmingham, Alabama, they meet their Grandmother. In this chapter, the grandmother is warning them not to go swim at Collier's Landing, because there are whirlpools there, and young children have died there. Kenneth doesn't trust his grandmother, especially since he doesn't even know what a "wool pooh" is. He's not used to the deep Southern accent. His older brother explains that a "wool pooh" is Winnie-the-Pooh's evil twin brother. Unafraid, Kenneth goes in the water, and gets caught by the "wool pooh" until his older brother save him.    And so, all day, I've been muttering "wool pooh" under my breath for amusement.
