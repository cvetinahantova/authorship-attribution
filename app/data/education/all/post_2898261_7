Dedicated to: ADMV  For I have come across a glow, A brightness that I know not of, It radiates a warmth that I cannot explain, A light like no others before.  Why it has touched me is a mystery, For as my mind replays itâ€™s touch, A smile races across my face, A tingle bounces in my heart.  It is an energy that I have dreamed, One not of this plane but instead, A gift from He who rules all. A reminder of the power of Love.  Though these words may be defined in ways Other than what their true meaning is, I shall endure in how they make me feel. For to really feel is the freedom of Life.  As I write the words in front of me, I continually travel to that moment When I stared into the eyes of this Light And truly felt removed from being physical.  I ramble now as I continue this mesmerizing Journey into a beauty, Warmth and Feel That I have dreamed about all  Of what is my recorded history.  My enormous thanks to the universe, For allowing me this moment of Glow, This opportunity to touch an Energy, I did not think could ever be real.
