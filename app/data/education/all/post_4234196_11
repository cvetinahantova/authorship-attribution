It is the end of the day and I am getting ready to head home.    I helped Guy put all of the CPUs back on their respective shelves and sort out cords and connections.  Mostly crawling on the floor work.  As Guy does all of his work with students by way of the computer, there are no copies to be made, etc.  I am kind of getting a free pass in this area, as I have seen lots of other teachers making piles of copies and sorting through mountains of old paperwork to find sheets that they need.  Tomorrow, we will mostly be learning names and covering some of the rules of the classroom.  I don't think anyone will even touch a computer.  I am to report at 7:30 a.m.  Be prepared for locker problems, says everyone.  Our hallway has 7th Grade lockers and word on the street is that *nobody* will be able to open their locker.  Apparently, you need to spin, spin, stop, left, spin, right, spin, twist and pull.  I think that the "twist and pull" gets them.  Tomorrow, "real kids."*  Wish me luck!  * My original post for this blog was "live bullets."  By this, of course, I was refering to the military saying after soldiers have gone through training with rubber ammunition and are then thrust into real combat that they will be facing "live bullets," as opposed to practice bullets.  This in many ways applies to the situation that many of us are facing.  We are done talking and practicing, we are now in classes with real kids.   However, I suppose that in the post-Columbine world, any reference to bullets in a classroom is probably taboo.  I have changed the post.
