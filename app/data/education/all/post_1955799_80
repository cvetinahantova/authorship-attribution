I had a topic, but then I forgot it while driving aroud.  LOL  Got a haircut today.  Boy did I need it.  My hair looked a mess.  LOL.  My beard was outta control.  It got cut proper, and looks good.  I love that.     Song of the day:   "Let It Flow" by Toni Braxton, cause the song says what I need to hear, which is to let all the negative pass me by.
