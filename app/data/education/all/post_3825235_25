Patriotism rules!Â  urlLink     urlLink     We went to Sierra Blaca today.  The whopping metropolis...j/k.  So, we went to their Chili cook-off, and, sorry to say, but most of them were too hot for me.  Yes, I am a wimp.  But, Abbie had so much fun.  We even saw an  urlLink American Eskimo ...I swear my heart ALMOST jumped right out of my body!  Memories!  Oh, well...  It was nice, but on our way to pick up MomMaw, there was this huge fire truck with a HUGE American flag hoisted across Mesa St.  Coolio, so, me being the big nerd that I am, I had to get a picture of it, so there it is! (Cue the orchestra)  So, on the way home from our rendezvous to SB, after a long, hot day outside, we get inside the car...for a long, hot ride home.  I was sitting on the SUNNY side of the, uh, street :) ! So I like, FRIED on the way home. (with the A/C, it wasn't too bad, but let me bask in my fry-ness...)  Then, after I got home and put Abbie to bed, I decided to take a long, hot BATH!  BUT, this was my decision, and I had my new book, "Sam's Letters to Jennifer," by James Patterson.  I am such a romantic now...I know, you're thinking, PUH-lease, but it truly isn't me, really.  Well, needing to get in bed, so I am going to cut this short and try to make my 'blog more interesting...either tonight or tomorrow.  Check back again, soon!
