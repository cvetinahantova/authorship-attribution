I got to see my friend Jen today! She and her husband are here from California, we (Erin and the kids, Mandy) had donuts and hot drinks this morning. I somehow forgot that I had school today at nine, but luckily my fellow classmate called and told me that class had been cancelled, I really lucked out because I wasn't even on my way! hee hee. I left our get together early because I had to finish some homework before the next class.  I found out today that I have to be in a different school next semester and also a different grade. I'm a little sad because there are so many reasons why I want to be at San Tan: the little girl that I take care of goes there (Brynn), the youngest Cornejo boys (Marc and Andy) also go there I've seen them in P.E. a couple of times, Tyler I have seen there he is a buddy for the younger kids, and also because I love the kids in my kindergarten class, I just love everything about that school. I understand that I have to try different grades and I understand that I need to get a feel for a different school but there is just something special about the connection I had with some of the youth group kids because I went to their school. Also my connection with Brynn because I get to see her at school. I know God will take care of me but it just seems so unfair!
