We are here.  It was an interesting trip.     We started out Friday around 5:30.  We made it to Chelsea, MI, where we hit a lot of traffic.  Then heard a wierd noise.  It was our car overheating.  By the time we got out of traffic and off an exit it was 7:30.  No shop open to get our car looked at and fixed, but luckily we have two guys that know something about cars.  (Matt Everett drove down with us)  We stopped at Meijer and the guys bought an oil pan, thermostat, and some other tools and flushed the radiator and changed the thermostat.  We were on our way again at 9:30.   The car still overheats whenever it is in traffic and we now know it is because the fan is broken.  But we made it to Myrtle Beach alright.     The drive was good.  Good conversation and I hardly drove at all.     The last two days here have been rainy so Suzanne, Jaden, and I have been hanging out in the condo while the guys have practiced and played a couple of times.  Today there is a lot of sun and it is HOT so we are going to hit the beach.  After we bring the car in to the shop that is.     We only have internet access in the forum (part of the church) so I don't get online very often, but I'll try and keep posting whenever I can.  Dan, Suzanne, Noel, and Nicole are also here so their blogs should reflect what's going on too.
