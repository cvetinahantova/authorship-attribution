Homestarrunner.com, home of the popular flash cartoon Homestar Runner, went down late last night.  The site can be seen here:  urlLink This.   Today is a sad day for Homestar runner fans everywhere.                                    Oh, and if you fell for this... April fools. The link is a prank made by the brothers Chaps. It actually includes Stink-o-man!
