Well then.  Father, it is six days since my last post, and today is a very different ball game.  Friend came over, but no sex was had.  I thought about it, I must admit.  But it occurred to me, suddenly, out of the blue, (and actually in bed...) that I didn't like him that much.  So there was no sex. A risky strategy, I agree, to get oneself in to the position where a 6'3" aussie built like a rugby player could take exception to ones attitude and cause an awful lot of trouble...  But he didn't.  Phew.  And here I am, a few days later.  All children back home safe and sound and back at school and, oh.  Yeah.  Didn't I mention? I might be about to have an affair. Watch this space.
