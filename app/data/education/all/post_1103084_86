- feeling good - but only for a moment -    just read over some blogs after getting an email from a friend who just read -- wondering what he encountered... and realized that i felt the same way this morning as I did on  urlLink July 23rd .  Anyone have a sign / astrology / a portent / anything that can explain this continuity.  What makes people feel good?   for me? this morning?  a great intimate / kind email from a good friend.  the crisp cold of autumn and the fierce blue of the sky.  class held downtown at  urlLink muggswigz.   But then I had to be an *advocate* for openness and dialogue in faculty senate.  I love the people in faculty senate -- but it, like any senate, reflects the complexity of living in institutions.  Not my favorite feature of human existence right now... (in case you *haven't* read any of the last hundred blogs! Thanks for the affirmation, Marcaus, on these feelings....it meant a lot to have a simpatico spirit so far away)  And now I don't feel the smile of the universe anymore.    Hopefully my kids -- who I'm about to spend an hour with -- will show me the joy of being alive....  Peace~  But
