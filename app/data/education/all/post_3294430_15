peter sensei returned after a two session hiatus. we have also two students who are singaporeans studying in australia. they have been doing kendo since january so they are slightly ahead of us. with peter sensei back, training sessions are now back to normal. disciplined, and very challenging. this is something which i prefer. traditional kendo is what i'm trying to find. ultimately before the end of this life i'll be able to find a sensei who is able to teach kenjutsu. anyway we have been given the go ahead to wear the gi and hakama the next session. unfortunately for me i'll be on an educational trip next session so i'll have to miss that training session though. will read up on how to wear it in ozawa's book, "kendo the definitive guide". i also did some maintenance on my shinai. it was becoming lose so i dismantled it, looked up shinai maintenance on the net and then followed the instructions.   1)  urlLink Shinai Maintenance homepage
