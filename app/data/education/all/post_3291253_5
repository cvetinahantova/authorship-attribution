I think I am a moderate fan of  urlLink Cosmic Baby . I could be much more of a fan if I could actually afford to buy any CDs. But hell, he's one of the great when it comes to electronica. It sure feels a bit wrong when teens nowadays believe that there is nothing greater than Moby or whatever electronica they listen to, if they do at all. I also miss Future Sound of London. They made me so happy, and they still do whenever I get to listen to them. I get so bored of having the same CDs. Sometimes I catch a bit of sample from them in the Discovery Channel, that always makes me smile. But it is also sad that we can't continue to enjoy their sounds, but somehow we can still listen to Madonna and U2 even after 20 years. So lame. Perhaps I should build a list of groups that I would have loved to never let go of ever. Maybe someday.
