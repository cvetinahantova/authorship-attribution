A Mystery   According to my sitemeter, I was on IJ last night for 45 minutes well after I had thought I was asleep.  I have no history of sleepwalking and neither does my girlfriend.  Likewise, the dog was in her crate and has yet to demonstrate any facility with the internet.  I'm mildly creeped out here.  Is there an obvious explanation that I'm missing?  The Hobbes I was reading this morning is suddenly relevent; memory as indistinguishable from imagination as indistinguishable from decayed sense.  I love that crazy royalist bastard.
