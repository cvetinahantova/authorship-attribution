urlLink Information Literacy in Higher Education  While browsing using Google, I found this interesting paper.  It appears to be a student paper from 2000.  I probably shouldn't blog it because if I do it will probably vanish but I'll take my chances.  From the introduction:  The topic of information literacy is of great interest to me.  I feel passionate about the teaching-learning process and am always eager to discover what new skills students are learning.  When I first heard of information literacy, I was intrigued.  I knew of literacy, the ability to read, and since I had developed an interest in the Internet and the World Wide Web, I wanted to find out precisely what information literacy was.  I wondered if I was information literate.  After doing my research, I discovered the answer to that question, and it surprised me.  Information literacy is a skill that all students need to acquire; however, since my “track” in graduate school is academic librarianship, I’ve focused on information literacy in higher education.
