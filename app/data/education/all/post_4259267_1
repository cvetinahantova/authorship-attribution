There is no such thing as hatred. i try not to hate people. but sam goes beyond hate. while i am trying to help her, she taunts me. telling me how shes a threat cuz my boyfriend would choose her over me because she is prettier than me. Greg would never choose you sam. i dont care if i was the ugliest person in the wolrd and u the most beautiful, if u stayed the way u are (personality wise and i stayed the same way i was,) then there would be no chioce. no competition. Greg loves me for who i am, not what i look like. you were never a threat, you are not a threat, and you never will be a threat. you can flaunt yourself to him all you want, walk up to him stark naked and say "FUCK ME!" and he would turn away, and come to me. i think she told everyone in my church that we are no longer talking, seeing as they all came up to me, and said how broken hearted sam was. so im assuming that she played me out to be the evil one (again!). but what ever, she knows what she did, she knows i have nothing to be ashamed of, she knows she's only contiuing the reasons why i am no longer friends with her. its your choice. i have made mine.
