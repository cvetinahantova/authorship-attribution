I dunno whether or not anyone will read this, because I'm not sure too many ppl still visit here regularly, but I had to post this.  It's like 15 till 12 right now.  and like 30 mins ago I started dusting my room.  Like all of it.  Everything.  Not just part of it, like all of it.  Behind stuff, under stuff, everywhere.  I dunno why.  I was lookin at the computer desk and I was like man this is dusty.  Well, it's not dusty any more!!  The dresser is still a lil dusty...I'll have to finish that up 2morrow or something. I just wanted to share my dusting experience today.  And I also wanna figure out what kind of font this is.  Because it's different when you post something than when you type it.  I don't like the font it is when you post stuff.  I like this one though.  Gotta figure it out.
