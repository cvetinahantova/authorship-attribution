People walking down the street, saying everything is fine. They can see it coming, but they don't have time. Everyone is moving-Hell prepares her gates- Entering eternity and finding it too late. People open up your eyes.   Strangely it seems that we've lost our sense of sight, Walking in the shadows, so afraid to show the light. See the souls so damned, or is there nothing left to see? You've tasted every pleasure, is there nothing left for me? Anywhere?  Anyway?  Can you spare some change?   Mr. Sentimental cries, and Mrs. Harlot plays, While hypocritics say the Word, and everybody pays. Do you see the harvest?  Do you even care? Too busy with adultery to even take the dare? People open up your eyes.   Strangely it seems that we've lost our sense of sight, Walking in the shadows, so afraid to show the light. See the souls so damned, or is there nothing left to see?
