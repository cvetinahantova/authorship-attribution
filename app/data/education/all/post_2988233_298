I feel liek I haven't posted in forever, and its only been 2 days!  The benefit for Savannah went great!  There weren't a lot of people, but they really gave their hearts out.  She was of course charming.  She sang "if you're happy and you know it" 3 times.  So cute.  And she reactd well to so many strangers wanting to hug her and talk to her.   So now, to wiat until the 23rd when she is listed on the UNOS list.     I have had a headache for 3 days now.  Just on one side of my head, the right one in case you are wondering.  But it is driving me nuts.  Its stress, I know it is.   Mom is having a horrible day.  Actually couple of days.  She seems liek she is just in a daze, and higher than a kite.  BUt she hasn't had her meds, so she can't have OD'd on them.  Casey is spending the night with them tonight, so he can call me if they need me.  I'm hoping she will go to bed and sleep. But I'm not counting on it.    I will try to write something of more substance tomorrow, I am really tired tonight, and just want to cuddle up to Tommy and get some rest.
