Well, I can hardly believe it.  Today was my last day of "freedom" before returning to work after summer vacation.  Our summers in Keller are so short...we are only out about seven weeks and I am not quite finished recovering from last semester yet.  Tomorrow it is back to the salt mines as they say.  I'll have a few weeks to get used to my new kids and new schedules and then my graduate school will begin again!  Why am I doing this to myself??   I have to work, so that one is a no-brainer, but the grad school thing is just a personal achievement I really want to have.  If I didn't have to drive all the way to Denton to attend classes it would not be so bad.  Oh well, I guess I will just suck it up and do it anyway!   Scott and David are not at all happy either.  They go back next Tuesday...what I would give for one more week......
