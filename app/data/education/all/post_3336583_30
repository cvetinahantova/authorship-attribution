What is a rebuses? It is a puzzle where you decode a message consisting of pictures representing syllables and words. When I was in early elementary school I  loved  reading and making my own.   Today I am busy getting ready for my trip to Clearwater, Florida. I   urlLink       out Friday morning and I am so   urlLink      ! I am going to visit my family and some friends that I have not seen in 10 years. One of my friends has a   urlLink       that I have not seen yet. I hope we have   urlLink       weather because I want to spend lots of time at the   urlLink       getting a nice   urlLink      . Justin is going to take out the   urlLink       with my brother and sisters. I don't go that far out in the ocean because I am scared of   urlLink      ! We will watch fireworks on the 4th of July. I might take the kids to play minature   urlLink      . Well I gotta   urlLink       and go get a pedicure so my   urlLink      look pretty!
