I phoned the dealer up this morning about cancelling the car. I told him the position I am in and he said to leave it with him as his manager isn't in until later today, but he couldn't see it being a problem. I am still really worried though. I've been having nose bleeds all day. One minute I am sitting at my desk, the next it just starts pouring! I have a headache and blurred vision too (although I think that is down to looking at the screen too long on my PC).
