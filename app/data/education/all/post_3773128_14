Just finished my Korean exam today. So now I can at least sit back and relax for few weeks before having to do any study (not that I did much study anyway, but I'll try to do better.)  Well, frankly I think I did quite well for the exam this morning, considering the amount of time I spent doing my revision. But we still have our speaking test once we arrive in Korea.  Hopefully I do well in it. I really want the incentive provided by Seoul National University.  Just to make things clear: We'll be studying 6 levels of Korean, and if we manage to get 90% and above for 5 consecutive levels (which is hard but not impossible), we'll be awarded with 1/2 the tuition fee for the next level, which I still don't exactly know how much, but better than none.   Today is the last day I'll be seeing the ALMs, and I'm really overcome with emotions. Even when I was having my exam I was thinking about them.  To all ALMs: farewell and God bless
