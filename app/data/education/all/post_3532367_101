Fantastic day today. Got up (before the alarm again) and was waiting outside for my lift - good start! During one of the warm up races there was a major accident right in front of us, and the GP itself was good too, although the winner was a bit predictable! The traffic wan't too bad on the way home - only took 90 mis to get to the M40, which by previous years was a total bonus apparently.  Highlight of my day - a 50 minute phone conversation with Angela. She sounds older than she looks (although at 37 she is 4 years older than me) and while she knows how to have fun she is sensible too. We shared some serious moments about married life but had a great laugh too. I even managed to get her to agree to coffee one day ;)
