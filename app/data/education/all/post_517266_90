North Carolina - Spoke at three schools today.  South Rowan, East Rowan and Irwin Middle School.  I don't know where to begin.  ERHS and Irwin were in their auditorium and it was an amazing group.  Tons of energy and respect.  I really appreciated being there and felt appreciated.  At SRHS, they went way out of their way to decorate the gym for the day and to celebrate ALOHA in the halls and with the students.  Although sound systems in gyms can be nuts, the audience really endured and hung in there and I really am thankful.  There is something about North Carolina that I really like.  Thanks for the hospitality.
