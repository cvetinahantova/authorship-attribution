There seems to be some confusion in the polls regarding a Dean v. Bush race.  Today's USA Today/CNN poll has Bush ahead 59-37, but a TIME/CNN poll from earlier this week has Bush up by only 5 points, 51-46.  What's going on here?  The USA Today poll has a larger sample size, but not enough to make for that kind of difference.  My guess is that something is amiss in the timing and methodology of the TIME poll.  It was done by Harris Interactive so I'm not sure about the methodology.  Also, the poll was conducted from December 30 to January 1, probably not the best time to reach people at home.  Finally, the TIME poll seems the an outlier when you look at polls over the last month:  CNN/USA Today 1/2-5: Bush 59 Dean 37  TIME/CNN 12/30-1/1: Bush 51 Dean 46  CBS 12/21-22: Bush 55 Dean 35  ABC 12/18-21:  Bush 56 Dean 38  Newsweek 12/18-19: Bush 53 Dean 40  CNN/USA Today 12/15-16: Bush 60 Dean 37  The average Bush margin across each poll, except for the TIME/CNN poll in question is about 15 points.  Also, there seems to have been very little movement over the last month.  I'll need to see more polls before I believe that Dean is competitive with Bush at this point.
