Have you been to a festival where there has been so many people you can barely even walk??   Well that's where I was this weekend...and boy oh boy, I have never felt so murderous before!!  :-D   It started out great!  Not too many people, but then all the festivities began... sigh, next time I think I will just stay home!!  It's not fun ending an evening wanting to kill someone! or a whole bunch of someone's!!  :)  I would think since in Japan people are so set on" keeping to the left" on the escalator when you are standing on it, not Walking down it, that they would have something like that on the streets at festivals! or at least Something half-assed organized!!   I have been in Tokyo at one of the Shrines just before Christmas and New Year's, I have also been to Fireworks festivals where you can't see the station platform, just rows and rows of people, I've been to other festivals as well...but going to this festival was insane!!  I don't understand how people can do that all summer!    Does everyone walk away feeling like this?!  I sure hope not!  Thank god after a lot of EXTRA WALKING SPACE and away from the crowds, calmness came to me again!  I really didn't want to go to a jail in Japan!!  Especially since I am going home so soon!!  :)  hahaha
