Do You Remember?  It's conference week.  You remember conference week--the panic you felt as your parents came in to meet with your teacher and discuss your "progress" (or lack there of).    In order to accomodate our working parents, we stay late two nights this week.  Which is fine as long as parents show up.  All of mine did yesterday so I'm fairly happy but completely exhausted.  How do people work 14 hour days day after day after day.  I would be wiped out and unable to think after about two weeks. (Although I would be able to go to the bathroom anytime I wanted so there are trade offs...)   Caterpillar Update  Yes, we are "growing" butterflies in my classroom.  This whole endeavor is fraught with peril.  Some kid's caterpillar is likely to die somewhere in the whole process and then it just gets sad.  So far, however, we have 33 caterpillars all still living.  Yesterday, we transferred each creepy crawlie to it's own little cup, complete with stinky food (it's green and almost gel-like in consistency--it smells  so  bad!).  Today, the kids handle them for the second time.  I'll keep you updated on there survival rate...
