There is a saying..."No gain no pain". I agree with that phrase ....  the path to success is full of thorn!!  In getting a right track to present my  thesis statement as well as the topic sentence, I have to think deeply whether or not ut will come in as a complete package without lacking anything anywhere.          The introduction of my topic sentence was not good because it is not clearly focus on the sensory device that I'm going to talk about.... the feedback I got from my lecturer.After doing some reflection I think I can sharpen the focus by clarifying what type of sensory devices that I am going  to present, for example'sound'.If I were to talk about this device I must talk about it in one or two sentence(s) before providing all the evidences with an elaboration of it.          I too must take into consideration whether the introduction focuses clearly on the main point of the essay. In doing this, two questions lingering in my mind...  1. Does my intro let reaaders know what to expect as they read on ?  2.Does it make the significance of the subject clear so that readers will want to read on ?          I hope the rest of my position paper will fulfill the thesis statement need and accurately state the real point of the position paper.
