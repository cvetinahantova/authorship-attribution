Now begins the descent into madness.  What a fool I've been to assume the drinking would stop.   What kind of man says he's off to the grocery store on a Sunday morning and doesn't return until early Monday morning?  I guess it doesn't really matter.  In the intervening hours, I have come to a decision.  My marriage is over.  It's just not over yet.  I must steel myself to do what women since the beginning of time have done.  Be patient, wait.  The bills must be paid off.  When I leave, I don't want to be in debt.  I want to be free and clear.  That must come first.  I shall endeavor to be a good wife and mother, and all the while, I will be working hard to pay off the bills while beginning a savings account of my own.  One hundred and fifty dollars a month to start, direct deposited.   I found that there was very little emotion this time.  I have become apathetic to the whole thing.  I want my life back, I want myself back.  I don't want to be shut in with the paranoia, the distrust, the rub of feeling that is too painful to bear.  I want to be free of it.  But, I want to be free of it on my own terms.   I am a strong individual.  Perhaps I was never meant to be married in the first place.  Perhaps I was naive enough to believe that he wouldn't stray into the depths of his disease after so long out of them.  Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.  I want my strength back.  So now, I settle down to wait.  I can do that.  I've had lots of practice.
