I went to watch a pratice at the high school today. I missed it while I was there. I miss performing and all that stuff but when I in my normal life I dont miss it. Do I want to do winterguard? Is this me just having a moment of craziness. Shouldnt I just focus on school my first year and get settled before I get all crazy and have myself divided in a million pieces again. I just finished with colorguard. Do I really want to start the whole thing all over again?? What do you think?
