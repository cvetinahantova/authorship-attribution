The baby has been sick.  Throwing up and...uh, other bodily fluids sick.  This is the first time he has been really sick since he was born.  It hasn't been fun...  The good thing is that I've stayed home with him for the past two days and even though he's been running a temperature as well as the bodily fluid things mentioned above, he hasn't been particularly cranky.  In fact he's been tearing around the house with his little cart as usual.  Other than taking care of the baby, I've been really boring this week.  Get up, go to work, come home, go to bed, repeat boring.  Since we were actually back on our regular schedule for the first time since February, work has been really busy too.  I've been trying to get the kids settled down and back into the routine.  They have actually been great (although since I took two days off, we'll  prob'ly have to start  that  process all over again on Monday....) so that's the end of my excuses.  OK, must go to bed, get rid of this headache and hopefully become coherant tomorrow.
