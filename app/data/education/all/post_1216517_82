anyway, on that last post.  I got Tasha's #, but I'm too scared to call.  We'll see what happens  I don't feel like writing, so I'll just post some excerpt from recent emails i've written.  Regarding bad relationships:  Yeah, unhealthy relationships are great. Such a good way to stun spiritual and emaotional growth. I make myself sick sometimes. I'm not in the "i'm never gonna get married" camp. Because I really want to, but I think I'd be wise if i held off on all that kind of stuff untill I'm about 30. I'd save a lot of hassle. Although, I know that I'll throw all this idealism out the window for the next pretty skirt that walks around the corner. c'est la vie...  ...Yeah, it's weird.  It's like something takes over your mind. Yeah. That's it. It's mind control. Amorous feelings in the wrong context can be deadly. Definitely gives you some kind of brain damage...Damn. What is that? It isn't love. I think it's just temporary retardation.  That is, unless you do end up getting married then I think it becomes a form of prison once you realize how stupid you are.  Regarding smoking and drinking:  I like beer.�It might be my favorite beverage. I love going to pubs with my buddies and having a pint...  ...Yeah, I never drank or smoked until I was 20.  I'm a late bloomer. And yes, coffee is a solid number 2 for me. For a while I enjoyed a little coffee and bailey's in the mornings before class.  Now that was a drink.  :) Oh man, all my friends smoke like fiends.  i don't know where it came from, but everybody. yeah. it's weird. I resisted for a while, then i picked it up.  I've all but quit since being away from their evil influence. But man, in Europe I smoked like chimney.  I was at my height which was, at times, half a pack a day.  That was pretty hard to maintain though. I can't smoke more than 3 cigs a day with out feeling sick and gross.  But, i must say, there are certain times that a smoke is quite appealing. -When one is ont he back porch at night shooting the breeze with friends. -When one is enjoying a coffee either at night or in the morning. -When one is enjoying alcoholic beverages. -When one is in a foreign land.  Regarding the best beverage ever:  Sidebar: I have invented the most savory beverage on the planet � the Guinness milkshake.  They are more than excellent and I highly recommend them.  (If anybody steals that idea and markets it, I will bludgon you with a show horn)  Regarding Teen Missions International:  I was reflecting on the Ukraine trip with my buddy Trevor.  I don't if I told you about Trevor. He's my best friend.  He was on my '95 TMI Thailand team, we were roommates at Biola.  Anyways. The Thailand trip was fun, but the leaders weren't the greatest. Obviously you know about the Belize trip.  I'm just glad it didn't scar me too deeply. The Ukraine trip was unique to me. I don't know if i was just young and naive, but Everybody on the team just seemed really cool, like no real trouble makers...So in summary.  I like the Ukraine trip. Very positive, very life-forming.  Reguarding Vice City:  Um, yeah.  I was addicted to Vice City for a while. That game kicks the asses of every other game in the world. There are like 25 million ways to kill people in that game.  The problem with it all is that it affects you after you are done playing.  Like I'll be driving in real life and be sizing up things I could possibly jump. Or when I see a police car, I want to steal it. That's never good.  Regarding my crappy car:  Despite all the good things that have been going on recently, the past 2 weeks have not been too pleasant for me.  My car is dead. Well, not dead, it's just been in the shop for 2 weeks and will cost me lots of money which does not make me happy. The whole situation is pretty crappy. I took some vacation days so I could go watch the Detroit Tigers play in Anaheim and because of no car I had to sit on the sofa all weekend.  Boo.  Regarding my foul mouth:  I don't think swearing is something you necessarily do when you get older. I would think It would normally peak at the pre-teen ages. My language has gotten a bit out of control. I consider it one of my more obvious character flaws. I think it's mostly a product of being lazy. Foul words are much too easy of a way to express a mood. It's harder to confront a situation head on than it is to swear at it. I would consider my passiveness, sloth, and apathy much more devastating but less obvious character flaws than swearing though all tend to be equally repulsive.
