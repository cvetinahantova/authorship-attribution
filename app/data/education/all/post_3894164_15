I went to go see the new  urlLink King Arthur  movie today with my brother Art and my cousin Joe. I cannot recall the last time that the three of us went to go see a movie together, and I am afraid I do not know when the next time will be. Joe is moving to Texas soon to be with his wife and two kids. I certainly hope that he finds what he is looking for down there, and wish him the best of luck. I know that he is moving about 30 minutes away from the University of Texas in Austin. I will definitely try to make it down there to visit him and the campus.  I thought the movie was good, but I am partial to the movie  urlLink Excalibur  made in the early 1980’s. Excalibur was based on the book  urlLink Le Morte D’Arthur  written in the 15th Century by Sir Thomas Malory. This new version is based on some new information that was uncovered about the Arthurian legend. I will say that  urlLink Keira Knightley  was nice to look at in this movie. I read somewhere that she got her start as a double for  urlLink Natalie Portman  in the Phantom Menace. You can definitely see a strong resemblance between these two young actresses. Of course, I know not to look to closely at Miss Portman for fear that my friend Ira may get a little upset.
