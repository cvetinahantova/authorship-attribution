Call me old fashioned..    Â  Maybe I'm weird, but I cannot ever ever ever study with my legs hanging off a chair. Yah, weird as it is...I must study sitting down on the ground or on a bed. My whole life I have studied on the ground, but now days I study on my bed..I must have my legs scrounched (huh?) underneath me, or well I must be sitting the indian style way of sitting. That is the ONLY way I can study or do anything,and be able to pay attention. I could however study I suppose on a chair, but it never feels good,and I lose my concentration. Maybe my feet get cold who knows...I'm not sure..  Even when it comes to writing papers on a computer I usually sit indian style on a computer chair...otherwise now days, since I have my laptop, I sit on my bed writing with my legs scrounched under me...hahaha..it's just me....  I suppose I am old fashioned considering that I also like to sleep on the ground, more than I do on a bed. Same goes for sitting around, I'd much rather sit on the ground than a chair....
