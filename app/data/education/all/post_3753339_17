Work:  Fiction: 4 pages Non-fiction: 2 pages  Comments:  This was a quiet day.  No phone calls, no nothing.  I woke up around 2pm, and proceeded to eat way too much.  I worked on TGoP, and the first chapter is almost done--which is frightening.  My diss work didn't go as well; certainly I was not as productive as I was yesterday.  I spent much of my free time moderating at TDD.  I spent a lot of time reading "how-to" articles on Sci-Fi and Fantasy publishing--time that would have been better spent working, of course.  I wish I had more to write, but I really don't, as I didn't do all that much.  I am not going to bed yet, so hopefully I will be able to write more on my disseration.  My reading has suffered badly, and I should make sure I'm up to date with all my students' emails tomorrow.
