A clarification of a previous post   At some point I rambled on about how we were all pissed off about having to move stuff that ain't ours. I was going through the archives and happened upon that rant, and it just seemed to me that it may have sounded that I'm angry at Abhi... but I'm not. He's just doing his job. It's f*cking  Steidly  who's the goddamn bastage, cheapass windbag, leaflicking, mandolin strumming, tree humper.
