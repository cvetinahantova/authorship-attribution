The title's a lie, but it was sure funny.  LOL.  I did watch a lot of the Food Network a lot this week-end.  I should have got some extra calories from watching it.  Guilty pleasueres are so funny.  I watched a clam chowder contest, a BBQ contest, and a resturant that uses charcoal grills only to cook its food.  Some of the chowder looked so rich.  They used heavy cream and stuff.  Pretty cool.  You have to love your chowder to go there though.  LOL  Today it rained.  Lightly at first, then it rained some more, this time a little more rushed.    I hate driving in the rain.  Makes me nervous.  'sides I drive like an old man when the weather gets on the wet side.
