That is the sound of time ticking away. I only have 14 days left in England before I have to go back to Egypt. Don't get me wrong, I am looking forward to returning to the sun, the heat and the karaoke, but I will miss my folks. Also going back means that work is about to start again.  I teach Egyptian dolls and army boys how to read, write and count using the British curriculum. That means they know about Queen Victoria and Henry 8th but know very little about Egypt! I do look forward to getting my new class. The only question is: will they be the children I was told I would be getting at the end of last term? We will see.  The Children go back to school on 31st August, but teachers return on 24th August so that we can prepare our classes. There will be many new teachers joining this year so that is kinda exciting. Hopefully they will be a fun-loving bunch and not members of the older (I mean OLDER) generation.  Anyway, these next two weeks are mine. Even if it rains like it did today (not used to rain - it only rained three times in the last year in Egypt!) or if it is sunny, I will be partying in London and Brighton.  Enjoy your life!
