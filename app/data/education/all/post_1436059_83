Oh Lord, Monday.  I asked my mom to wake me up this morning, since I kept setting my clock over the weekend (You know, to get back into the swing of things) and I was either sleeping through it or it just wasn't going off. Anyway, my mom knocks on the door and says, "Wake up, Mal, it's six oclock." You know what I said? "Yeah, so? Why are you waking me up so early?"  Argh I just hated it today. I would have been more awake if it had been a B day. I love B days.   On my current event report for US Govt about the new law (which they're already challenging) about partial-birth control I got an A. 100%, in fact. Go me. I think it's just because I'm very opinionated on current event projects and whatnot. Anyway...  *Sigh* There's not much to say now...  We decorated our home for Christmas yesterday. Oooh ahhhh. Our house looks really cool outside and our tree is really pretty. We started lighting the Advent wreath yesterday too. Christmas will be here soon, and all I have for gifts for others is Lacross balls for Shelby.  I have to go shopping...grrrrrrr
