We needed to go to the local supermarket yesterday. The thought of it actually worried me as my tactic had been one of avoidance. Sandra and I got the things we needed - beer, pop, wine and crisps - to entertain the friends that had given me a lift with my bike. When we came out, I told Sandra that I found it difficult to go shopping in the current situation, knowing that I couldn't spend. I had wanted a CD and if it had been up to me I would have just picked it off the shelf and put it on my card, but as it was, I didn't even mention it. It was something small, but it was still just as hard to "avoid" that section of the shop.  The evening went well, but Icouldn't drink any beer or wine because of my tablets - again a frustration. I don't drink to excess, but like to have a social drink now and then. With Euro 2004 coming up, I am already thinking about what I am going to do when I get asked to watch the match down the pub....
