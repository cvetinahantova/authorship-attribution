Let me preface this by satating that I am NOT a journal sort of guy.  I have no intention of gleaning life-altering wisdom from this, or selling it as a sort of "middle-to-late-twenties-coming-of-age-journey-blah-blah-blah".     I will tell you that this will give me something to do on the off- (good) chance that there is nothing going on in the office at the moment.     I will tell you that this will also contain some strong language at some points, but not as a rule.  There's nothing like a good f-bomb every now and then to illustrate the height of the writer's emotion...consider yourself warned.     Everquest is down at the moment, with the third patch in three days.  Out of a possible 72 hours of play time, they've been patching for 7 of them.  Bastards.
