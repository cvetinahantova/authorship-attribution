I went outside earlier to see if there was any mail, and it was sprinkling. Oh man, I felt so incredibily refreshing, and peaceful. Nothing like the rain to cheer me up. After all, I want nothing more than to jump out of my depressing mode.   I'm refraining the urge to cry since last night. God, what a mess. I'm over this. I can't..put myself in this type of position ever again. I don't care.   Whatever it was. It's over.  Honestly, I think everyone fucked with my mind really badly this time. Even worse than the time in eighth grade. I miss eighth grade. Mr. Rowland is leaving MLMS. I need to go talk to him. Maybe deep down, I know I'm avoiding the chance to talk to him. He ill-advisedly told me to never be involved with Rory, and I failed to heed his warning. I failed everyone.   I'm too in touch with my damn emotions. Nothing feels right anymore. I feel old, and used. My life has had too many painful experinces. Too bad for me to even bear any longer. However, the threshold of my being is still barely holding on by a thread. So close to breaking, and letting everything shatter into thousands of pieces.  I just want to leave the drama. England is meant for me. I can't live in the goddamn golden state any longer without wanting to bash my head in. Everyone acts like California is the place to be. Yeah, it is if you're into materialistic, superficial, drama queens.   Fuck this. I'm over everything. I'm returning back to my suicidal state.
