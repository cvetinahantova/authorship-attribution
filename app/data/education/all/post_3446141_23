I have just changed my blog it is now bright ass LIME GREEN and I like it.  It was a hard choice however I was considering the pink version of this same template, butttttt I decided I would go with green and save the pink for later.  I like change...but what do you think??? Is the green too harsh?  I don't know why I ask, it doesn't matter too much the green will be stayin for a few weeks at least.  K!  Nite everyone! ;p
