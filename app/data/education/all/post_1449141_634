urlLink NathanNewman.org - News and Views: Reflections: War, Globalism & Sectarianism   A long piece by someone who is thoughtful and progressive, if not always nonviolent.  He raising some good questions about War, the military and how to proceed as a peace and justice movement.  While I can question some of his points of view (supporting the Kosovo war for example) much of his critique of the sectarian anti war left is right on.  What do you think?
