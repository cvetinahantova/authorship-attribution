Today we got to enter the subdivision again.  I was so grateful that the whole family waited for me to get home from my workshop, even though they had been able to go up since noon.  It was really important to me to be there with everyone at the same time.  It was devastating to stand knee deep in hot ash, digging thru what was left of the house. At first, it was hard to understand why certain things were where they were.  Then we realized that everything upstairs, had fallen directly below and was now in the basement.   We were able to find shards of pottery and remnants of bits and pieces but nothing of real value.  I took lots of photos that day - some of them turned out really well - there is a link to the slideshow I made at the bottom of this post.  What stands out to me the most is how selective the fire was. The house on either side of my mom were lost, as well as two below and yet the one directly below was ok and the houses across the street are untouched. The fire spread with burning embers so there are pockets of devastation as well as waves of fire that took out entire roads. The fire fighters said that the firestorm hit with a wall of fire that was 200 feet high.  Three fire fighters lost their homes but kept on working until it became too dangerous.  One thing the city is proud of is the fact that there has not been one injury or death in this tragedy.  My mom had been on evacuation alert for three days so she was prepared and took almost everything valuable to her.  We have since remembered that she forgot her wedding and prom dresses, as well as our childhood 8 mm movies which she thought that I had. :(  One of the subdivisions hit had no warning so some people didn't get anything out at all and there were some others that just didn't take the alert seriously.  Here's a link to a slideshow of pictures of the house.   urlLink http://sd23.bc.ca/ame/curlew.html
