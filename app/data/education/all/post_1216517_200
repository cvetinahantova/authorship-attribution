STINKY FISH i went snorkeling today.  i swam with big fishies, sting rays, manatees and sharks.  it was really tiring.  i really had to poop at the end of the trip and thought that i might have to make a pre-emptive strike while still in the water.  luckily i made it to the guesthouse bathroom and stank it up.  have a nice day.
