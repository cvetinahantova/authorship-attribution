HMPH!!! I didn't get to post during the weekend again. Haaayyy.  Well, we finally got our ring. Sobang happy!!!! Exactly what we wanted. It's with Myk's mom for safekeeping now.   Myk and I played baminton again Saturday night. Not as tiring that the first time...improving na. Kaya lang, nagyaya naman mag-eat si Myk after. Nyek!  Slept in late yesterday..Sunday naman eh. I've been tired the whole week. Ate and Jelu came at 2pm. By 3pm, we were pigging out on isaw, manggang hilaw with bagoong, bread and liverwurst spread. Yummy! Afterwhich, Ate ad I fell asleep with Jelu in the middle. Hehehehe. Batugan.  Good morning Monday to CCE!!! TOXIC!! Buti nalang I had to leave before lunch and buy stuff for the staff conference. I got back shortly before 3pm. Hehehhe. Got the gift tags from Kuya Chino!!!! Yey! we can start decorating the giveaways this weekend!!!! Hay, slowly, we're getting by. Kuya Chin will be printing the big tags soon.  Mimoy and Apple, my voluntary coordinators, were also asking wen to meet. Oh goody! Set meeting next week in Glorietta. Alright! help is on the way.  Michael also sent the pictures he took of the ring this afternoon via email. Nice! Posted it at once in webshots for people to see.  Time to go home now. Another day has ended...
