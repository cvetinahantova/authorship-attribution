Revolution Rock   An expanded London Calling-- including an extra disc of demos AND a DVD-- will be  urlLink available  on September 21.  Needless to say, I'll be buying this.  I'm not generally a fan of such superlatives, but no album hit me at a more formative moment in life or mattered more than London Calling did.  I don't listen to it often anymore, but when I do, its a combination of nostalgia and that zen-like meditation that one can slip into listening to music that is intimately, and perhaps unconsciously, familiar.    But I also plan to be disappointed.  Interest in the Clash has spiked in the past five years.  But with the exception of Joe Strummer's  urlLink last album , this interest has yielded nothing but a  urlLink load   urlLink of   urlLink crap .  I know because I've bought every bit of it, full of hope and faith, only to end up very disappointed.  And pissed off.
