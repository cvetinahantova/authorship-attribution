Hi I am sitting at home. I am eating some breakfast. My brother made huevos con chorizo. It is weird because I am not a breakfast person but I like to eat huevos con chorizo. I was really tired this morning. I didn't get much sleep last night. My brother and his wife were arguing all night (with no exaggeration all night). My brother has been staying with us for the past week and its been really frustrating for me. I was being patient and didn't tell them anything last night. It is sad because on the weekends is the only time I have to get a good night's sleep and I was not able to. I have been really frustrated having my brother at the house because he is childish and he is very messy. He doesn't care. Yesterday I spent all morning washing and cleaning the house and I get home and the house is a mess. My room is a mess and it really bugged me because he is really disrespectful. I feel bad because then I tell him off because it gets me upset and I know I shouldn't be telling him off. In fact "I'm the Christian  here." Keep me in praer. My mom doesn't come home until Tuesday morning God willing.
