Well.  Here I am.  Posting the first post.  Not much to say except that my old Blog is DEAD...completely DEAD.  I took it down.  So here I am, starting anew....Yup. Don't know what to say.  I'm singing in my brother-in-law's wedding in June. I went to practice the music for the first time tonight and I must say that it's going to be quite easy if I look at it at least once between now and then. :)  Today at work while I was in the middle of having my Kindergarteners do the pledge, the power went out.  Evidently there was some sailboat that clipped a power line and took out power to the entire ghetto.  We were only without for about 30 seconds or so but most of the neighborhood was out for the afternoon.  Hm. What else?  House is doing great.  We've got all the blinds up and curtains up everywhere.  I just have valances to finish for the kitchen and our living room.  Well...start, that is, not finish. :)  I think that's it for now.  If I think of anything else interesting I shall let you know. Fer Sher, Man. :)
