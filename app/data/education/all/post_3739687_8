hello all  well sister erlinda is definately a nutball.  she purchased a program for nilza (a brazillian woman) and myself to figure out and teach with.  only she got ripped off becasue the copyright is from the 1970's and the program is not very reputible.  so pretty much i spend all of my day at work correcting papers and figuring out good exercises for the kids to be doing.  another thing that makes it difficult is that i only see the kids once a week so learning names and faces is going to be close to impossible.   anyway...  honestly i only spend about two to three hours in the classroom.  that's going to change soon.  they've already noticed that i have too much free time and they are adjusting my schedule.  yuk. but atleast i won't be sitting around pretending to work.  i must pretend because since i'm new they are keeping a close eye on me.  i think they must have hired incompetent teachers in the past or maybe ones that tried to get away with doing as little work as possible.  honestly i can already tell that once i've been there for a few weeks i'll probably be able to do as i please.  i'm looking forward to those days.  other than that no real complaints.  i never have any work to take home and all the other teachers assure me that this won't change.  gotta go i think i'm going to eat indian food tonight. yummy in my tummy.  love ya'll  jane
