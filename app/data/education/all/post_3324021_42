For a short time the administrators of the Alex For 2007 blog were considering moving the blog from blogger.com to blog.com but have determined that blogger is a much better choice. In looking, mostly at features and appearance, we chose blogger over blog for reasons like. . .         Blogger offers a spell check (Which I really need!)     Blogger has more choices in design.     Blogger is more user friendly and eaisier for me to post with, blog.com has many complicated menus and they create odd words I don't understand.    We are happy to be staying on with blogger.com and will now shift back to student government news.
