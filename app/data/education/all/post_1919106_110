Don't you love...   ...Quiet evenings? I know  I  do. I like to do nothing but lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Maybe read a book. But no running around the place, no appointments to keep up... Just  wasting  time.  On another note, here's the results from a quiz I took. No big surprise really.    Mage: You can bend and twist reality to your whims as long as you are willing to pay the price. Knowledge fuels you, and spurs you to new and challenging heights on a regular basis. Magic is your tool of choice, and no matter how you invoke its power, you can control and shape it to your whims. You try to slowly change consensual reality in order to allow others to experience your power, as well as lessen the negative effects of casting your spells. One day you hope to transcend this mortal husk that binds you and become something greater.   urlLink   What type of World of Darkness Creature Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
