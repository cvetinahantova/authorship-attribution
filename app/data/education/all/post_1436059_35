You are the Dread Pirate Roberts.  There will be no survivors.  Your name has become more powerful as a weapon of fear than many others ploys. Keep working to maintain the justification of that fear, but remember what is important in life.    urlLink   Are you a Pirate?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Awesome. At least I'm not someone stupid like Mary Read or Black Beard. I'm someone cool who no one that doesn't know about pirates knows about. Did that make sense? No, but it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm the Dread Pirate Roberts. I don't get what it is with everyone and PotC! I mean, it was a good movie and everything, but all it did was create a whole new breed of Rabid Orli Fan Girls. GASP! But I love both Jacks, monkey and pirate.
