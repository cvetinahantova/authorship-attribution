Cause sometimes we just need one. No this is NOT one of my political tirades. It is just what it says, a Wake Up Call. All too often I drift from day today like a dream content of what life serves me. While inside there is this voice saying, "WTF Jamie? this is so not who you are!" So here I am taking back the reins and giving that other guy a big old slap in the face WACK! (don't you miss the old Batman show from time to time?) If you ask some people who their enemy is they will often say time, well I say BS. Our enemies are pessimism,Procrastination and Motivation.  Well today I just used my utility belt to wipe them away.  Today I set some goals and because I have nothing to hide I would like to share them with you, like to hear?,here it go....  1. My favorite time of the year is approaching, no not figure skating, college football. Before you start this sure bit. Ask any of my close friend what a freaking football nut I am.  I am going to see my tigers take on the canes in warm Miami in November (this trip is all but a done deal but I have to make sure it is done)  2. Spend a long, relaxing weekend in Charleston soon. (this one is for you Jennifer)  3. Try to learn something totally new..i.e. a instrument or foreign language  4. Get my white butt to Europe before next summer  5. Stop being so go with the flow, be more aggressive with people (ok that one sounds mean but I am such a push over)  6. Get involved. So many causes that want to support and now is the time to do it.  7. Make a difference   Some have more details than others but it is a blue print and this time next year I want to be able to start a whole new list, and wow you with my musical stylings on the accordion...just kidding, well maybe.
