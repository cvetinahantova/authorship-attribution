Once upon a time, in a land far, far away there was a little Anglo-Saxon boy named Beowulf. As he was walking down the stoney path, he encountered himself a young Jute girl named Olga. It was love at first sight. There was one minor problem, their love could not flower for they spoke not the same language. Fortunately, both their languages came from the Germanic line, so there were some similarities.  Beowulf said, "Oi luf u, u luf e?"  Olga responded, "Ya, I rove yo."  As they participated in a quadlabial fricative it assimilated their sounds into, "I love you." And so the English language was born. Along with their son Sven. [ . . . . ]  ---Jim, Brett, Sean
