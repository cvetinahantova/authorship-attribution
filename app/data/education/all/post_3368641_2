don't I wish  in this hanging moment that I could hold on to each surfacing emotion burning and coaxing me ever deeper into the layers of you exposed so that a clue to the production that became you would reveal itself to me  in this moment I can see decades as dust I can capture the untimely death of a child and the untimely birth of a man  I empty the vacuum by speaking the words "I love you, and am proud of you" in this moment a perfect stranger becomes a father and a perfect stranger becomes a son  Â©2003 DC Vision
