tito cocoy and i went to watch a movie today. for the first time, we went to "the podium" to watch spiderman2. it was really cool! and peter parker is kinda cute [heehee]. we even won something at the end of the show because there was a raffle. i saw the sponsor's, warren, only son, robbin, he must've been 17 or so and he looked chinese and was kinda cute. he is so lucky because his dad named his toy company after him, "toys by robin". the move house was so cool. it small and that means good. there was even free food. then before we went home, we went into this bookshop and it was amazing there. the books were so nice but we were in a hurry so i plan on looking around some other time.   *** i'm finally getting the hang of my guitar. i've started to remember some chords but still can't play a song. i need jammi to teach me. speaking of jammi, i bet he's so angry at me he won't even call me. i can't believe i already missed two of his calls, the calls i always look forward to. i don't know how to play the guitar and i need him...not only for that...but i need him...
