Josh gave me permission through an email to do this.  I know what I said and at first, it seems hypocritical.  Think what you want but I think I'm being fair and respectful.    That's all for tonight Josh.  I'm going to leave this for you and I'll continue my thoughts soon.  In the meantime, enjoy the summer.   That goes for the rest of the Local Cafe.  Keep on rockin in the free world!
