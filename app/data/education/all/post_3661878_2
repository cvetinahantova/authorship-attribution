Well, I thought I was going to post here nearly everyday...but as you can see that might not be working out so well...  i just saw my old best friend, Dara, that I haven't seen in a little over a year for circumstances I would rather forget.  I really hope we can become great friends again.  I can see us "getting old" together: through weddings and kids and old people stuff too.  I really should tell her that, don't I?  We had this huge conversation and although I really wanted to push her out of my life, seeing her made me realize what a good friend I had lost.  Like a soulmate, I told her.  We cried of course and I don't know.  I guess I realy did miss her.  Anyway, she looks absolutely amazing and I give her so much credit for what she did.  So, as an inspiration to me, I will begin my long and difficult journey into losing weight.  Now, it's only about 30 or so pounds i want to lose, and I have lost nearly 30 already.  So I guess that puts me about half-way there.  Its just difficult, being around kids with snacks all day.  Yes, I'm a 5th grade teacher and I adore every minute of it.    The year is nearly over with a week left to go. Jeez...I can't believe it's been a year since I first started teaching.  I can clearly remember arguing with my parents, specifically with my mom...about being a teacher.  She always had this way of adding in that I should think about it, how great I am with kids, etc., etc.  Well...I did it...and now its the end of the first year.  I already told my kids I will cry on the last day of school and even possibly their culmination.  Ha Ha!    So, I guess that's it for today.  I will hopefully keep you updated on my journey. Ta Ta for now...
