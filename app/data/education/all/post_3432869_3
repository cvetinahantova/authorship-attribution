Happy Birthday to my roomie, Andrea!  It's funny how I remember writing my journal entry last year on her birthday.  My, how things have changed in a year!  Last year I never would have even imagined all the new and exciting things that are happening in my life today:  I have a wonderful boyfriend, Tony, I'm about to make a career change, a location change, and some other serious life changes.  Tonight the girls went out to eat to celebrate Andrea's birthday at a place in Middleton called Vin Santos.  Excellent Italian food.  We were even so lucky as to have Chloe come up from Chicago to join us!  I really miss having her around.  A funny thing happened today at the bank.  I met a man, Thomas Lucas, who was opening an account to start up a sister-city organization with a city in Japan.  I didn't recognized the name of the city.  I didn't even know that it was in Japan until he said, "I'm going to be the only signer on the account right now because our treasurer is going to Japan in July."  I found out that the girl was going to be a CIR (Coordinator for International Relations) with JET.  That struck up some very interesting conversation.  He even invited me to a meeting next month to meet some Japanese folks here in Madison.  Should be fun.  Maybe Tony will want to come along?    Sometimes life spooks me out when things happen like meeting Mr. Lucas.  I mean, I met him a day after finding out about my placement in Japan.  How bizarre.  But then I remember that it's all a part of God's plan for me and I really feel like God works in marvelously mysterious ways!
