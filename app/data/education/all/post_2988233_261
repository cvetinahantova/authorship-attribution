Tuesday is date night for me and Tommy.  Tonight, no date night.     Renee and Savannah are on their way to Chapel Hill to get the rest of Savannah's tests for her transplant done.   Renee is my babysitter.  I am her's.  We like it that way.   Not many people will volunteer to babysit for 5 boys.  They don't have the gonads to do it.     Not that is is a difficult job, you just need nerves of steel, or be the most laid back, go with the flow person on earth.     So far this morning, I have dealt with two arguements over the video game, one fight between the dog and son #4, thrown several 4 ft metal sticks away that were being used for swords (they even had pointy ends) confiscated firecrackers, and held three  summit meetings on the importance of  1-not hurting your brothers feelings by calling him scardy cat, and    2- actually helping your brother when he is stuck in a tree and is falling out 10 feet above ground,    3-  helping your younger brother get away from the dog that has chased him down tackled him and is playing and unwilling game of wrestlemainia with your brother, while your brother is crying for help, and you are standing there laughing your head off watching the dog rip yor brother's shirt.  A new shirt by the way, he just got over the weekend.   In the movies, brotherly love is so simple, they would fight to the end for each other.  NOt so in real life.  Brothers are the enemy.  Brothers will take even a girl's side against another brother if it will embarass him, mildly hurt him, or there is the slightest chance brother will pee his pants in front of people.     It's just now 1pm.  Bed time is a loooooooooong way off.
