Well it was carry on as we left off after I got back from Silverstone. Sandra was in  a strop. I tried to give her a hug but she didn't want to know. She moaned about having been left with the kids all day while I was off enjoying myself. I said that perhaps I should move out - her comment was we can't afford it. So I suggested seperate beds but she said there wasn't enough room. She still says (although not convincingly) that she wants to be with me.  She continues that any affection is hypocritical as the other day I was contemplating killing her, but now I wanted sex. I had told her how I was feeling to try to shock her into realising how bad I had felt. It doesn't seem to have made any change.
