Ok so I still don't have hot water at my new home....UGH!  So this morning I got up around 6:50 so I could leave and shower at a friend’s house.  And let me tell you it was the BEST shower ever!  He had this cool showerhead so it was like I was showering in the rain.  Oh I liked it a lot!  Can't wait to go back tomorrow, yes tomorrow and possibly Friday. We called on Tuesday to get the gas turned on, but they said it would be Friday before it would be on.  Also still no cable or Internet, sooooooo makes for a lovely night of unpacking, but it's ok because I have vodka and grapefruit soda now!! LOL. Oh that reminds me.  Yesterday was my grandma's 78th birthday!!  Happy Birthday Grandma.  She is in town and so I went out to my parents’ house in the Wood to celebrate last night.  My dad grilled since we didn't on Memorial Day because I was all movin and shit.  But anyway my Grandma is funny because she is deaf in one ear, and I always forget which one and end up having a conversation with the wrong ear...lol.  Anyhow for her present I got her a little picture frame thing that would match her bedroom AND because she loves cheap alcohol........I bought her a 4-pack of fuzzy navel wine coolers.  She was very excited and got a kick out of it.  She gets silly drunk off of like 2, and it is very fun to watch.  So I provided entertainment for us all by giving her the wine coolers. Hee hee. Ok well back to me.  I am at work Hella early today!!  I know it's hard to believe, but I got to work around 8:20!!  For those who don't know I'm usually not here till like 9:20.  So yay for gettin some extra time in!  Ok well I am off for now; I must get my morning caffeine before I have absolutely no focus what so ever.  Bye for now.
