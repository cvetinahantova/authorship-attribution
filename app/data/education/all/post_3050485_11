today is our day of reckoning. i did not memorize for the exams. honestly i don't like memorizing. anyway i hope at least i don't flunk, better yet, to be more optimistic about it, that i would do well.  so it is political law for today. what more? hmmm.... i think it is time to get off from the internet and do  some honest to goodness reading. procrastination is my middle name.  : )
