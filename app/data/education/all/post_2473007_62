The heavens cried, the teardrops fell     And spattered on the streets of hell. A smoky haze entombed the town,     Devoured souls without a sound. Each ghostly form, devoid of life     Cut here and there - a piercing knife Now thrust into a weeping form     As sorrow haunts him, black and warm; And never-spoken fears arrest the soul.   Undying pain with all its death     Beleaguers him with every breath Of hopeless air; more hopeless still     The children by the windowsill Who spend their days in ashen heaps     'Till evening comes and body sleeps. And death without but punctuates     The shadows moving through the gates In silent ranks, attending to this end:   "Defeat! Despair!" the mourners wail     And fling their cries into the gale. (The tempest on the sea of death     Spoke terribly with every breath) The breath - that breath that from them pours,     Like foul stench from Hades' shores, Defiled every decent thing     And made the raven pause to sing Of death and of mortality's decay.   The shadow gone, the rage subsides;     But deep within the soul abides That nameless fear of death and hell-     That fear for which the teardrops fell. Immortal though this coil seems,     The truth is more than shapeless dreams And will reveal eternal worth     As this Transition moves us forth Into the life beyond this life we know.
