Well.. i'm at e sch library now. I'm in e middle of my 3rd free period! Kewl man.. come 2 sch with so many free periods. My second free period was spent wif my darl. Haha.. it was kewl.. Have 2 look out for teachers and stuffs. U noe how teachers are right. Not all of dem of course. Only some. 2dae, we'll be having a rehersal for the national day performance on friday. The 'Outdoor' parade and also the indoor performance. You can't exactly call e observance parade an outdoor parade in my sch coz its done in e gymnasium. An enclosed area. So.. ahhaa... Its bartley campus.. wad do u expect man? Going 2 wear e No.5 J! My first time wearing dat. Very seldom does and ncc cadet get 2 wear such a ceremonial uniform. No.1 uniform gets so dull and boring after some time. So i guess its gonna be kewl. At least i get 2 show pple myself in uniform. Haha.. Afterall, which girl doesn't love seeing a guy in uniform! Haha.. I did another video for this event. ANOTHER! But.. i've realised, my video editing skills aren't dat good. Its still juz at e low level stage. But with a good word from miss gan, my mgt tutor, the principal wants me 2 work wif the technicians from both toh tuck and bartley and produce videos for Graduation Ceremony and stuffs. It would definitely be a learning experience for me. Getting 2 work wif real professionals. Its gonna be a blast. Yeah.. Life is good.. Its all good!
