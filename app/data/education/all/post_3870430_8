Hi all,  This is a serious post, which we will discuss in class tomorrow. Having consulted with other English teachers and the school, it has been decided that a modified "strike" policy will apply to the blogs.  Any breach of the blog rules, which are posted on this site, will receive a strike.   As you know, the blogs will be assessed. Three strikes means that you will fail the blog task.  Based on what I have read so far, I don't expect anyone to fail from breaking the rules. In fact, I have been truly impressed at how well everyone in 8S has done - there are people who have developed beatiful templates, insightful posts, and some pretty good jokes, too. I'm extra impressed by the way almost everybody has stuck by the rules, even when it was tempting for them not to.  In other words - great work.  Zoe
