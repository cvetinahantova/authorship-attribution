Hey everyone! I just wanted to thank Donna, Denine, Krissy, and Caddie for a fabulous weekend.  I'm glad the wedding was in the morning so we could make it to NY on Saturday.  It was good to see everyone, we should get together more often.    Speaking of getting toghether... Is everyone going to home coming?  People are welcome to stay in Spencer with us, but I'm not sure if Mike and I will be around the whole weekend.  My brand new cousin Amelie is being christened Columbus day weekend in NY city, I think that's the weekend of homecoming.  I hope I'm wrong cause I'd love to have you guys hang out in Spencer with us, especially Donna since you've never been to Spencer before.  Not much going on around here.  I just started tutoring kids for the fall SAT.  I have one student whose prior SAT score is like 730.  Hmmm...  guess there's no where to go but up.  I've been looking at the questions she got wrong and she misses REALLY EASY stuff, she could be a tough one.  The other three girls are fun and pretty average students.  None of the are thinking about HC, I'll have to work on that.   I also wanted to show you guys some pictures from my sister's wedding.  Hopefully this link works   urlLink http://www.barkerweddings.com/new_photo.asp?id=1611  .  If not go to barkertavern.com then select weddings, then recent wedding and the pictures are under Patrice O'Sullivan or John Grace.  Hope all is well with you guys. Karen
