Check out  urlLink this  link for pictures of my Adventure in Ecuador.  I've been over here since September, and I'm going home in August.  Well, back to Canada at least.  Not quite sure when I'll get home home.  Well, not quite sure where home home is gonna be exactly.... ahhh the joys of being in limbo as a single.  Well, Parent's home is home home for now, and I've no idea when I'll get there either.  Anywhoo, I'm here in Ecuador with  urlLink Avant Ministries  (formerly Gospel Missionary Union)  I'm working at the  urlLink Alliance Academy , a missionary school that served most of Latin America at one time.  And that's enough for this post.
