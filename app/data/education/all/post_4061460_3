In just a couple of weeks I will be teaching a Freshman English course at Fort Dorchester High School in North Charleston, SC. I plan on having my students keep a blog to go along with their reading of the diary/novel  Go Ask Alice . Honestly, I have never "blogged" before. In fact, all of my attempts at keeping a journal have been dismal failures, so I hope my students will help keep me accountable by checking up on me every once in awhile as they write in their "blogs."       I will be giving more info about myself on this blog in the future (on slow news days), but today I need to go pick up my kids from basketball and cheerleading camps, do my Bible study, read some more, go pick up some class sets of novels, start to work on my syllabus for the upcoming semester, begin to create a web site for my classes, and hopefully get in a little  Star Wars Galaxies  before my wife gets home from work.       Hopefully, I will add to this blog tonight and tell you how my day went.
