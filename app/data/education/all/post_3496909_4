I'm a person who don't usually say out my problem...Just can't find a person to sit down and talk...So even if I have any problem. I just sit down there and keep quiet..Or sometime I just smile even i'm not happy...But if sometime that person ofference me... I confirm give that person a nice black face... And also those nice nice words will come out... Yupz... that's me... I last time had a quarrel with my friend..Don't wanna say the name out... I think got 1 month never talk to her... At times i felt guilty, sad and also angry... But i always think that it's my fault for starting that stupid quarrel... Why izzit my fault. Because if i talk to her. She will not get to know about his percussion guy in band... And also will not go into relationship with him... And as i can see, she love him with all her heart... But that idiot just don't know how to treasure her...In my eye he really treat her badly... And i hated him alot... If you were in my shoes and your friend is some how so call bully in that way will u like it...will you bare to see it... Up till now i still hate him... Maybe he had some good points...but i still don't like the character he has... Well it's the pass...but this guiltiness still make me feel bad... I still think that it's my fault... I cause this thing to happen... it's all my fault...
