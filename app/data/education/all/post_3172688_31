Hey...  It's been awhile... Anyways I wrote a poem:    Untitled     W ishful thinking,  H opes and dream;  D on’t take them away from me.   I  need to know  T hat you will eventually  H ead out the door,  S ay good-bye, and leave.   T he stress is   S omething so big,  I  can’t even say;  S ometimes I wish you   W ould have left yesterday.   I  need my   S pace,  W hy can’t you see?  I  can’t  H andle  Y ou here with me.   I t’s amazing  H ow everything  S eemed to   S ing.   B ut that was  B efore you came.  N ow everything  S eems so lame.   I t’s a wonder why  N obody likes you  A nd your petty little pouts  T his is why we get angry  A nd why we scream and shout.   I  hate you with a  P assion  A ll of you, and your  F ashion.  E verything seemed so  R ight  W hen you weren’t there  A t night.
