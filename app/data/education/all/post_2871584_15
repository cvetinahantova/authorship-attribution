It's so strange.  On one hand, I'm so deliriously happy to be leaving Georgian Court, and heading back to Utica.  On the other hand, I keep telling myself "this is the last time you'll be doing such and such."  I get all sad and nostalgic.    Then reality sinks in, and I'm happy again.  Today was fairly basic.  Connie and I went out for our 4:00 coffee run, and insanity ensued as always.  Tonight, Nicole and I went to Target, and then we got some Chinese food.   I need to find a moving truck to rent.  It's amazing.  I only have two weeks of work left.  Damn.
