From the last time I blogged things have gone up.  My back does not hurt anymore, the biggest plus ever.  My little ER visit in Hawaii cost is around $700+, thanks Queens Medical Center!  The bigger focus of my life is that fun job hunt.  I've been working on the sub teaching application for about 5 days now and its a slow process.  Finally got rid of the feeling that I am in some type of moving vehicle, Jen knows what I am talking about.  Being on vacation for the time I was had the whole mixed blessing/curse thing going.  Hope all the rest of you are well!  Thanks for all the comments and concern.
