Yeah, I've been MIA for a while.  blah blah blah.  I had a lot to write, but I'm feeling drained.   Alot to do.  I', taking a test to be a teacher.  I'm got an interview to be a teacher.  I'm got to take a nap.  yadda yadda.  i've been really tired recently.  nap nap nap.  I feel like an elliot smith song.    get this.  these questions were on my biola internet resume thing.. I filled it oout my self just now.  :)   > When I meet people, I like to find out the answers > to these questions > (they can be bias-inducing though):  >  >  > -What is the most important thing to you right now?  Thing?  Like an object?  or can it be conceptual?  Ok.  I guess I'll go with the more common material mindset and say...music.  Good music.  I'm listening to Nick Drake right now and it's beautiful.  I love the soundtrack to my life.  On a higher plane, Hope is the most important thing to me.  I can't wait for this world to be restored to its former glory, because the shithole that it is right now is really getting me down.    > -Do you think it is okay to swear? Oh.  Apparently so.    > -What type of music do you listen to? "type" is a stupid discription.  I appriciate and music that is well-done, and has a bit of emotion behind it, though my bread and butter is the progressive/indie rock stuff (with pop sensibilities, of course).  > -What is your purpose in life? What?!  Is question straight from that Rick Warren best-selling classic?  My purpose?  To love God and to love others.  > -Who is a person that you think is funny? Me.  > -What kind of clothes do you wear? Comfort over fashion.  I've getting better though.  I recently bought slacks.  > -Who is God? big question, holmes.  creator. father. savior.  comforter...shoot.  my daily sustainer.  my everything.  > -What do you think of your parents?  They showed me a lot of love when I was growing up.  For that I am thankful.  I have a hard time getting them though.  We don't think in the same terms.  They are both very unique and with both show up as characters in my writing.  > -How do you want to die? loud, dramatic, big crowd, hero's death.  or something that makes lots of people laugh.  > -If you could commit a crime and get away scott > free, what would it be? rob a bank.  no doubt.  that'd be cool.  > -Where do you want to live? anywhere along the mediterranean.  but probably LA with have to do.  > -Do you like baseball? is this a joke question?  > -Do you want to marry me? If I could I would.  > -Do you like to break things? very much so.  > -Who do you hate? I really can't think of anyone.  oh, anyone on a tv dating show.  > -Why are you talking to me? because i am me.   That's me.  word.  dmh
