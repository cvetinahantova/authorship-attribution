I've been wanting to create one of these for awhile but I haven't because I'm lazy. And well tonight I'm still lazy but also unusually bored. Thank you Amy for sharing this with me. Now I can babble and just pretend ppl read this and care!   Anywho, I don't know what I should put in here.. nothing too exciting happened today. I slept in till 9 and that was the highlight of my whole day. Pretty sad. The highlight of my week would be the banquet. I was recognized for my work with my goats (not that that's a hard job but it was still cool). I finally got the whole boy friend meeting the friends thing out of the way and I think it went pretty well. The blown out tire afterwards was just an added bonus not to mention a nice learning experience for me. What did I learn? I need new tires and a AAA card *grin*. I'm such a girl..   Once I get started it's hard to shut me up. Those of you who know me well or not so well know that hehe. Maybe I talk to much? Nah that can't be true... Well I guess that's it for now. I think I like this more then changing my AIM profile randomly.
