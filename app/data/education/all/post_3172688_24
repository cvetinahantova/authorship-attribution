Hey! Right now I'm in Mr. Gary's class once again... Everyone is talking about shooting themselves if like something happened. Like just a little while ago the class was talking about the "Mr. Perfect" award that is going to be given out in a few weeks. This one guy that is a possible winner for the "Mr. Perfect" award is bisexual so some of the girls in this class are talking about how they would shoot themselves if he won. I really don't see how some of them can be so immature. I mean, I see how some people can be against bisexuals or "gay" people, but saying things like that in class is totally inappropriate and their opinion should have been kept to themselves. I don't mean to be rude towards people that are against bisexual people, and I'm all for them having their opinion, it's just that they didn't need to go that far. I am, personally, all for "gay" and bisexual people. That is their choice and none of my business. I don't think badly about people like that. I actually have some good friends that are "gay". If you'd notice the quotations, and are wondering why I am putting them there; the answer to that question is simply because, gay's original meaning was “happy”. Not bisexual or anything related. To me, this is the perfect term for liking the same sex though because if you found the one you want, same sex or not, then you must be truly happy, or at least happier than you were before. Anyways, this is all for today... I got to go. Bye!
