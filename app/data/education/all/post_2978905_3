Aloha.  I don't have much to say really.  You would think that after spending 8 hours in a car driving, I would have a lot to talk about, the truth is.. I don't.  I spent the May long weekend at home... in that city where I am originally from.  I visited with family, and friends... and it was sure a fun time.  So, I'm going to talk about something I hate.. it was a result of an experience I had.. whilst home.  Apparently... I am a bridesmaid in my good friends wedding.  And, that part is ok.  The part that sucks BIGTIME is that part where you are getting your dress sewn, and everyone is in there poking and prodding you.  I actually had to tell my friends fiance to turn around when they had my shirt lifted way up.  You would think people would just figure that out.  OH, hey.. that girl is half naked, perhaps I shouldn't be staring at her.  Either that, or they should call the wedding off, because he really wants to be with me :)  Perhaps I should ask him.  Anyways... my friend told me that I could wear whatever undergear I wanted to, and I did... low and behold the seamstress was yelling at me because I wasn't wearing the right stuff... I also forgot my damn shoes at home..  Wasn't a good scene.  Oh yeah, and everyone pretty much saw me naked.  Not cool.... not cool....    I guess I just think everyone should wear whatever the hell they want.  OR>.. just go to a store and buy dresses that fit people.  Uh huh.  That's pretty much all I had to say.  Oh yeah, and... beef jerky is good.
