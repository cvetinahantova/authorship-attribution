hey all,  well i'm starting to crave good southern veggies but other than that i'm adapting pretty well.  i really like what i've seen of the people and culture here.  hope ya'll get to come see me.  i'm still talking with various people about jobs everywhere i go but i looks like bangkok is where i'm going to end up.  i'm still on the island right now having a great time with karen, wendi and crew.  ya'll be good.  i'll write more later.  jane
