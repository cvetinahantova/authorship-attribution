I don't know if this day is significant.  But besides Spider Man 2 opening with a four-star rating (WOO HOO!), let's remember the Muppets.  Incredibly entertaining puppets have never been so cool. Everyone post their favorite.  I am gonna have to go with either Fozzie or Kermit.  Although, I think I am a lot like Kermit mainly cause no matter what we'll both always be chased by a pig.
