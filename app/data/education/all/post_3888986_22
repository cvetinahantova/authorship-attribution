I could paint you in the dark Cause I’ve studied you with hunger like a work of art These are very secret days I collect my information then I stowe it all away  Call me when you breeze through to your appointments The work you do Call me, I’m collecting you  The pleading prayer and hairshirt sting My hair-trigger love and faulty spring Motivation smokes a name, but I don’t like that smell applied to me so Blindly just the same   call me When you breeze through to your appointments the work you do Call me I’m collecting you Turning up my collar to an unseasonal chill you ask a favor, you know I will The rain comes a surprise we fly across the railroad ties I feel the danger the foolish thrill oh yes I will  What it will or won’t be then The shutter pre development the ink full in the pen Mind the mind’s eye’s trickery You might picture killer beautiful much more than it might be  Call me tell me what you’re up to what you’ll do Call me I’m collecting you  I would be foolish to think that I could turn it off and stay alive The way I live when you switch on hand on the dimmer, give me just a glimmer Give me just a shadow hope around the edges, agony and rapture forever uncaptured  Take these secrets to your grave Drug across your landscape and buried in your cave You’re piling up and out of sight But trying to add it up just feels like counting shades of light  Call me when you breeze through to your appointments what you must do Call me I’m collecting you  Hang it in my window let it complicate my view The separation the glass of you But I can paint this picture any way that I see fit The art of pain the subject sits unmoved
