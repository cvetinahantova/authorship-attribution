Hello,  Welcome to my blog. My name is Michael Choi and I decided to make this blog to keep track of my time here in Korea.  I am a 27 year old Korean-Canadian male from Calgary, Alberta,Canada.  I came to Korea in the fall of 2002, and unfortunatley I didn't own a digital camera untill now.  My blog will include stories of my stay thus far and stories to come.  As well as stuff on Hockey, Snowboarding, Poker, Teaching English, etc...  I hope you enjoy what is to come from GYOPOLIFE..and in case you don't know what a GYOPO is, it means overseas Korean, born or immigrated to a foreign country.  Take'r easy...
