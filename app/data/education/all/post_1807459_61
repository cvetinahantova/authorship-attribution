As I have a little free time I'll just babble for awhile.  As it turns out there is a KTF store in my neighborhood.  That was a very pleasant surprise.  So I hit it up today and got my phone working again.  I don't know what I'm going to do tonight.  At some point poker night was suggested but I'm not sure if that will materialize.  Today is the start of level tests and Steve has no work.  What a bitch.  Oh well I'm hoping I get tomorrow off.  It is getting colder but really it hasn't gotten that cold.  Finally my heater works.  This is good b/c I hate having to fall asleep while freezing my ass off.  I wonder if I'll work with Judy today?  One if my friends Clint is getting married.  This is strange b/c I never thought he'd get married.  His brother Meat (note, not his real name) is currently serving in Iraq.  I think we've hit a period of low energy amongst the friend group.  Seems I am the only one who always wants to go out and get crazy.  This could prove a problem for me.  I think I'm all Communed out.  The place is nice but I do believe in the old adage "there is too much of a good thing".  I also think I'm the only person not burnt out on downtown.  I guess I have a high tolerance.  Speaking of downtown it is getting all messed up.  One of my favorite places "Beer Boom" has be completely destroyed.  What a bummer.  On top of that the place across from WABA was knocked down and it now being rebuilt.  Stuff opens and closes in Korea so quickly.  The turnover on shops is just crazy.  Has El Toro been rebuilt yet?  I want to go shopping but I don't know what I want.  Does that make any sense?  I also dislike shopping in Korea b/c the owners of the shops are all so pushy and stuff.  Not to mention stuff in department stores is insanely expensive.  I need to clip my finger nails.  Ok time for work.
