This week has been a rather normal one, as weeks are concerned.  I’ve been rather excited about the fact that my final class for this semester is next Wednesday.  I don’t know what it is, but at the conclusion of each semester, I feel a huge weight lift off of my shoulders.  The weight seems to be getting heavier and heavier with each passing semester, but luckily, there are only two remaining before I can append some additional letters to my degree.     Other than that, I need to call our vet to schedule an appointment for our puppy to get fixed and boarded.  We are going to a wedding at the end of August, so he will have to be boarded for a week.  I hate doing it, leaving my little puppy, but I am sure he will be ok.  I never thought I would be so protective of a puppy.
