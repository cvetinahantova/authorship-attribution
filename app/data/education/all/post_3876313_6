Tonight I had an information session for work which means I worked 13 hours today.  Well, at the information night (entitled shake it up) I had a chocolate shake.  BOY, WAS I WIRED!  I cannot believe how much this baby has taken over my body.  I have never been wired off of sugar.  It made for an interesting presentation to the 50 people I spoke to.  I don't think I will participate in the shakes next week though.  ;-)
