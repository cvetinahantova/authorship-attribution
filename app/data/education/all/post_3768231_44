Bless my brother! lol. He knows I've got a 'thing' for  Greece  (which has absolutely nothing at all to do with the Olympics, by the way...). For my birthday last week, a large parcel arrived on the doorstep. He'd found a picture-book all about Greece, and had posted it up to me! Whoo hoo! I still can't believe the amazing colours of the place - it's almost unreal. The water is unlike anything I've ever seen before - almost satin. So, that adds upto 9 books I received for my birthday this year - 6 by George Johnston, 1 by Robert Lowell, and 1 on Greece! Whoo hoo! And there's 1 more Robert Lowell book to come - gees, I'll have to build a bigger room to fit them all in, I think... ahhh, you become more bookish as you get older, you know... well, that's my excuse, anyway...! lol
