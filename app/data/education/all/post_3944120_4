When I started this blog, I wasn't altogether sure of how much time would need to be spent on it. I'm now in that stage of "new thing" where my energy to continue it is waning, and I'm finding other things that need my time in a more pressing way.    Josh's computer is officially back to life. I brought it home to my workshop last night, and spent some much-needed time with it. I don't know what sort of virus that poor guy had in there, but it's gone now. I think he's the only person with a Compaq from 1998 that has Windows XP Pro, hehee. Quite the upgrade from Win98SE, dont'cha think?    I also set him up with FireFox and ZoneAlarm, as well as a free antivirus program whose name escapes me at the moment. He won't know how to run the antivirus, but he'll learn :)    Oh, and if you're ever in a hurry to lose $400, take your car to Midas. I got kicked square in the pants last night when getting a new exhaust for one of our "fleet" just because Ford decided to put this crappy braided steel section in their exhaust. I left the parking lot with a quiet vehicle once again, but feeling rather used. Wait until their computer breaks, then I'll be the one using MY knowledge to take THEIR paychecks away!! All your computers are belong to us.    Question: Do you ever feel like your lack of knowledge/training in a certain area puts you at a severe disadvantage? For example, my lack of knowledge about automotives made it impossible for me to know whether or not I was being hosed. What did you do about this?
