I had a look at some brand new cars on finance yesterday. It seems I could get quite a few for under the '100 quid a month' mark - Citroen, Renault, Hyundai….But is that what I want? I don’t know!       Rang up a chap about a Clio - he wanted 1350, but I said I would offer him 1000 (no tax and solid colour, slightly over priced) - he said no! Another had his car on auction for 1500, with no reserve and only 1 day left. I said I would travel the 80 miles with the cash, and pay the full amount without haggling, if the test drive was OK. He called me a "tssr!"….and his auction closed without selling.      I'll take a look at another second hand one at lunch. I've got to go into town this lunchtime, to renew my season ticket for the football team I support (the one luxury I was allowed, if I could save for it in time). I've decided that if I put the season ticket on a card, I can gain interest on my money in the bank, but pay off the amount outstanding interest free when the statement arrives - and it gives me more time to save, thanks to my wages not being there! Again, my Saturday job employer hasn't paid me, so I'm 100 quid down this week (that's twice in the last month that they haven't paid on time).
