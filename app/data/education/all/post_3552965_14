According to the thrilling editorial in this week’s Great Yarmouth Mercury, this is the winning combination which will soon be drawing back the crowds to what is, if the 6 foot multi-coloured sign that greets passengers arriving by train is to be believed, ‘Britain’s favourite Holiday resort’.  The new lottery sponsored Time and Tide museum is apparently set to transform the face of my home town, providing a wholesome, family orientated alternative to the lapdancing club, casinos and endless miles of amusement arcades where most tourists currently spend their time and hard-earned cash. ‘Fat women from Bolton and their skinny husbands with too many tattoos’ - according to Jim Davidison, the town’s main clientele - will no doubt be delighted that Big Y is taking steps to go a bit more upmarket...   Listen to me, cynical as ever.  I’m sure the museum is a good thing but I remain sceptical as to whether it will mean Yarmouth will become a ‘heritage resort’.   Mum and I will be taking a trip there in a couple of days though to see what all the fuss is about (and to break up the monotony of unemployment) so I’ll be able to give you a detailed report very soon.  In the meantime I’m just applying for lots of jobs and hoping that I’m lucky enough to get something soon.  I’ve been offered two evening classes by an FE college in North London which is a start I suppose but obviously I’d need to find other work too to survive.  Still, I’ve been getting a pretty positive response from my C.V and so I suppose all those years busting my ass in Camland may just be paying off.  I’ve littered my covering letters with references to ‘La Sorbonne’ which is hopefully going down a storm too.  I’m running out of things to say already so I’ll leave it here for now but I’ll be keeping you all informed of my progress on the job front/thoughts on life, the universe and the Time and Tide...
