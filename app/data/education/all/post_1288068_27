This feels odd. Do I reference no-longer-posts? Do I literally start my online life again, having metaphorically stripped naked and waded into the sea like a virtual Perrin? Perhaps I should assume a new identity and try to trap the boy into a crazy web love affair? With his own girlfriend! That would be fun.  And so to business. *clears throat and intones in newsreel manner*  Today I wrote my entire 'school based action research paper'. Or 'armchair based inaction no-research paper' as it shall henceforth be known. Go me. Tomorrow we are in a lecture. Joy. I wonder what it will be about. Jim is the new new Andy.  It is well past my bedtime. x
