Hi again,    Just got back from our trip to Vancouver Island.  While we were gone, Angie and Mom both called to tell me that another forest fire had started. This time it's practically in my own back yard.  It started on Monday night - this time a lightning strike in Okanagan Mountain Park, about 5 miles from my Mom's house.  My mom lives in a subdivision in the hills and is on one hour evacuation alert.  She wants me to come and pick up the 30 quarts of dills she just did...  lol.  I took pics of the fire from the Coquihalla Highway as we drove into town - it's unbelievable.  I don't think we're in any danger because there are plenty of houses between us and the forest but my mom might not so lucky.    It's weird to be going through this again so soon after the Barriere fire.  My BIL and SIL are back in their hotel btw, but they had quite a bit of smoke damage.  The fire fighters stayed in the hotel during the evacuation.  Louis Creek and Barriere town have been hit pretty hard.  Weeks later, the power is still out too...  I'll keep you posted.
