urlLink Credit Card Usage and Debt among College and University Students. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Tamara Holub.  It views the issues that around college student credit card debt.  From the ERIC Digest:  Since the late 1990s, lawmakers, college officials, consumer advocacy groups, and higher education practitioners, have become increasingly concerned about the rising use of credit cards among college students. A recent study has shown that both the number of students owning a credit card as well as the amount of credit card debt held by students has risen in the last couple of years (Nellie Mae, 2000). Since eighteen year-olds in most states are eligible for a card without parental consent or employment, many have been concerned that students will use credit unwisely because of their financial inexperience and suffer the long-term consequences of carrying high debt (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2001, June, p. 1).
