i miss my girlfriend. i miss bicol and i miss the four pillars urlLink  .   of course, i also miss my jealous bed.   gad, this education comes at a heavy price. i gave up too many things for this. i gave up a chance to go to italy, least i would be absent for more than two weeks this august. i gave up the comfort and the unhectic lifestyle of bicol. i gave up my car and my motorcyle, my spacious and luxurious room(hehehe). is it worth it? i have no idea. anyway, i just want to vent some angst.
