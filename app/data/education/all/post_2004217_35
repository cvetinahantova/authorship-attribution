Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman... Maybe he won't find out what I know; You were the last good thing about this part of town.

You need him I could be him I could be an accident but I'm still trying; That's more than I can say for him.  Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman...

Someday I'll appreciate in value, get off my ass and call you but for the meantime I'll sport my brand new fashion of waking up  with pants on at 4 in the afternoon. You need him I could be him... I could be an accident but I'm still trying; That's more than I can say for him.  Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman...
