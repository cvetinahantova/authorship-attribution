Were was I headed what was I looking for or maybe was I looking for something I already had?     Looking in to my existence? In the beginning I had a shallow view of the future and my existence. This view was influenced very much by commercial direction.  What I had to understand was my life was a journey, and a learning journey. What I was going to learn wasn't presented on any black boards or readable in any scriptures or manuscripts.   I had it in side me but to allow the lessons to emerge and humble me with there existence and directions is were the journey has it's storm's one thing that has certainly been shown to me is we have to listen or you will be made to listen!  Was I  strong enough to allow these lessons to be taught was I focused and wholly enough to see the lessons and step in the required direction.   Looking back it shows me many times when I feared to allow the messages to come through I feared being judged and I now realise the only judge was me.   I was a heavily one sided judge, I tried to maintain the so called  Normality  not looking into the general fear of the unknown.   What is normal and who can classify and describe normality and who decided on its boundaries??  An Easy answer used by all is society.  My question then is which society and which belief?
