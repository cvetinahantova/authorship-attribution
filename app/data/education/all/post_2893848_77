Who ate all my guava butter?                                                                 by IJ      I went to High school with  urlLink this guy , star of some new Fox reality show involving a deceptive paradise, deceptive breasts, and deceptive contestants deceiving other deceptive contests.  I know what you're thinking, but the lack of blurry-naked, deceptive old dudes, at least, is refreshing.  Actually, I went to elementary school with him too.  When I go back to my parents' house, I can see from our living room across the yards into this guy's parents' kitchen.  Before you think I'm creepy for knowing/admitting this, consider that they, at least, can see me in my parents's living room from their kitchen.  Actually, I not only co-educated with this fella for about twelve years, but I still have a minor grudge against him.  The high school in our town was two stops down the D-Line, and from our neighborhood, the D-line was a solid ten minute walk.  This guy, however, had an old buick he inherited from his grandfather, and drove to school everyday.  He  gave my sister a ride every morning, but not me.  Because his buddy, who lived right across from the D-Line, didn't like riding the subway.     There are a few ways to look at this:    -  If I hadn't had to walk that twenty minutes everyday for those years, I wouldn't have listened on my walkman to all the albums of my youth :  London Calling, Repeater, Damaged, Doolittle , and a retrospectively embarrassing amount of ska.  If I hadn't walked to and from the T so much as a kid, there's nothing to say I wouldn't still be playing  urlLink Dungeons   urlLink &   urlLink Dragons  to this day.  ( urlLink This guy  calls DM)  -  Being snubbed by someone never feels so good as when you find out that someone eventually went on to exercise such poor judgment as to be on a reality television show.  They say that it is important to be liked by the right people.  If that's true, why couldn't it also be true that it is important to be disliked by the right people?  -  I now have the calf muscles of a God.
