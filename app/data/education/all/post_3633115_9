Today will be a first visit for S, Shorty, and I.  We will be heading to my in-laws new place approximately 2 hours from here.  My father-in-law, C, is a minister and they were just relocated for the first time.  He had a change of heart to be a minister about 7 or 8 years ago.  He had been lucky to remain at the same church that they had been at for nearly 30 years. But this year, they gave him his own church, so he and my mother-in-law, V, had to sell the house they purchased brand new 30 years ago.  Now they are closer to us than before, only the town they are in has less than 5,000 people in it.  I get along fairly well with C and V.  I usually get "the look" from V about, well, it feels like nearly everything.  Anyone who has a mother in law would understand, I think.  So, I will be out all day.  No blog, no reading other blogs, no computer! Whatever shall I do!  Probably do the 15 minute walking tour of C and V's new town then stare at each other or the TV until dinner.  The nice part about the new house is that we will get to have a separate room from Shorty.  In their previous residence, we shared a room with Shorty and the computer.  This should be a very nice change.  Have a pleasant weekend, readers.
