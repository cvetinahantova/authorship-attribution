Hi there guys, Please could you pray for our little church, I don't know how many people I have spoken to about this, so forgive me if I have. As a church we have been meeting in a youth centre for the last 13 years. 2 years ago an Old church building in the centre of Welshpool Town went on sale, with the Lords amazing provision and guidance we have purchased and renovated it. We are moving in this weekend!!! From next Monday to Friday we are opening up the church to visitors from 10 am to 2pm, then having evangelistic meetings at 7.30pm. Then having a Thanksgiving service on the Saturday at 3pm. Please please pray for us.... That we will be ready as a church to recieve non believing visitors into our building and know what to say and how to say it, and that people will come to the special meetings, and that the Lord in His mercy will save people. We are so thankful to God for his provision, and we are now so aware of the responsibility that now goes with it. Lots of people have been interested in what we have done, especially as some of the older folk from the town remember going there as children, or have even got married there. This is a great opportunity to invite them back, and for them to hear the gospel. Any way, thats all for now, will try and update you as the week progresses. Love and God bless, Ruth.
