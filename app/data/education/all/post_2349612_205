the problem is, i have no excuse to be bored... i had math i could be studying, email i could be catching up on, chores/cleaning around the apartment i should be doing, fun books i could be reading, movies i could be watching, mail i should be sorting through, and yet i'm sitting here whining... go me.  dave called eh 50 minutes ago and said he just got in to pennsylvania... either he and his friend (a) drive slower than me (b) make more stops than me or (c) both... this isn't hard to do... i drive in 2 and 3 hour chunks and generally don't stop for more than 10 minutes at a time when i have a long way to go.  oh well.  anywho, this means they'll not get in til closer to 11pm now... 5 hours to kill... on the agenda: pay bills, make sweet tea, and eat lunch (yes i know it's after 6... doht)  i haven't seen anyone i know all day -- i think that's the problem... i might go pick up my plants, just so i can say hi to john instead of talking to myself til 11 -- ah, what a social life =P  later dudes
