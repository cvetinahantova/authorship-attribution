Go  urlLink Lance !     Hey, I might not be one to really get into sports, but Lance is from Austin and is totally kicking Ass! Other reports I read said that some of the other competitors had difficulty keeping up due to the 85 degree heat through the Alps.  Dude, Lance is from Austin...it's hotter than 85* like, all the time.  Here's for a 6th straight victory!
