The interview went well, I think.  The position is in the Public Information office at the District.  They deal with all news media and city and county officials.  When I arrived I was waiting in the foyer when someone rushed out of the Superintendents office needing to retrieve an article from the local paper the Glendale News Press.  Well, I happen to read that paper everyday online so I went onto one of the computers and brought up the site and searched for the article and printed it for him within about 3 minutes.    So that was a good start.  There was 13 questions that I feel I answered well.  I should know the outcome by early next week.
