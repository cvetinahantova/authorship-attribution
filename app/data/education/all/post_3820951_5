last night and this morning was another roller-coaster emotional ride for me...  before class last night, i cried talking to meg when she made me realize that soon it'll be the ber-months already and we are once more nearing the year's end...and i got an anxiety attack...the type where one is forced to think of what he or she has accomplished in 23 years of existence...  and where he or she is headed...sheesh!  after our research class, we went to mcdo to wait for her parents who will pick us up and we got to talking about applying for the graduate fellowship in dlsu...and i got excited because the program's really good as you won't need to pay for your tuition while you do research or teaching work for the university. and you receive a monthly stipend to boot! and you'll be a fellow! wow! my thesis mentor sir david bayot is a fellow...and he's published a book and is one of the most brilliant people in the literature department! expert on literary theories i swear! i really really really pray and hope we get into the program... have to talk with sir david (for the nth time!) about this and ask for his help...
