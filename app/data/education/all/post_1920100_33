Hi Its been a long time since I have wrote on this thing. I don't know if anyone reads this but if you do email me so I know and I am held acountable for writing on here! wlariso2@hotmail.com. Well to catch you up I Thank God I (and my friend) passed the CSET exam. I still can't believe it. I thought I had failed that test. Anyway, I am glad that obstacle has been conquered. I have also applied for teaching positions. I am waiting for a response on that. Today I have an interview to work at a center. I think I will be a reading and writing instructor but the lady in charge asked if I can teach math too. Well it is kind of weird right now. I feel that this interview is going to be a two-way interview me interviewing her and her interviewing me because I still have to find a lot of details. I still feel that if this job works out it will be good because I will be able to reach a lot of students that need that one on one help. I enjoy teaching so much. I am glad and thankful that God has called me to do this.  Spiritually and emotionally I am struggling. Please keep me in prayer. I hope everything is well with all of you. All of you make my life more special I am blessed to have you in my life.  For encouragement this week:  "Living a life of faith means never knowing where you are being led. But it does mean loving and knowing the One who is leading. It is literally a life of faith, not of understanding and reason - a life of knowing Him who calls us to go."
