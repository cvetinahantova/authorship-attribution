Sean Fahey, norse god/comic reviewer over at  urlLink Chud.com 's  Thor's Comics Column  posted an  urlLink great article  last week:   "I think of it this way. In any given  month , the  number one  selling comic sells at most  250,000 units. In its opening  weekend ,  Catwoman  sold approximately 1,670,000 tickets.  Six times  as many people saw  Catwoman , a film panned by critics garnering overwhelmingly negative publicity, in its opening weekend than read the first issue of  Identity Crisis , heralded as the year’s largest comic book event and June’s number one selling book. Six fuckin’ times as many. More tickets to  Catwoman  were sold in one weekend than issues of the  top five  selling comic books in the entire month of June  combined ."   That's a shame, folks.  These books just aren't for the geek set!  True, the spandex and superpowers world of heroes makes up a huge percentage of the comic books published, but there are many, many more that you're missing out on!  The article continues:   "How does this happen?  In short, I believe it’s because most people just aren’t aware that the material is available.  I won’t believe for one second that at least a third of the people willing to pay ten dollars for a ticket to  Catwoman  would not have rather paid that ten dollars for the first trade paperback of  The Walking Dead  or  100 Bullets .  I won’t believe for one second that a fan of  Law & Order  would not be willing to pick up the first trade of  Gotham Central .  I won’t believe for one second that at least one person in ten that saw the  Lord of Rings  films would not pick up  Conan .  I won’t believe for one second that anyone who enjoyed the  A-Team  would not enjoy  The Losers .  I won’t believe for one second that the overwhelming majority of George Romero fans would not be willing to pick up the first trade of  The Walking Dead , and I won’t believe for one second that the overwhelming majority of  Evil Dead  fans would not be willing to check out  The Goon .  I won’t believe for one second that at least ten percent of the people that read Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum would not pick up a trade of  Queen & Country  or  Sleeper …          …if they were aware of these books."   Please read the rest of the article!  (link above)   My current non-superhero faves are both penned by Brian K Vaughan--  Y:The Last Man  (about a future in which a plague has wiped out every male of every species except one man and his pet monkey), and  Ex Machina  (a book that is strongly reminiscent of TV's  The West Wing  and follows the the world's first superhero, now retired, and his struggles as the new mayor of New York City).  The wonky superhero stuff kicks major ass, too, though.  From last week's issue number 2 of Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke's  Justice League Elite , published by  urlLink DC Comics  :    Major Disaster says: (after magician Manitou Raven summons a giant mystical flying ferret to transport the team to battle) " Join the JLE.  Fight terrorists.  Good pay, benefits.  See the world by giant fuckin' rat.  Sheesh!  (Shotgun.) "     Try 'em!  You'll like 'em!
