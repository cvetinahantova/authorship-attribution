Hi everyone- I am not sure how many of you know about these blog sites- they are all the rage in today's world (one of the benefits of working with today's youth... I know the trends...well sometimes). It's my hope that this blog will really take off for us- that we come here, post our thoughts on whats going on in the world and relive the days of the hallway conversations. I've seen examples of them among other college groups of friends and once they get going they can be a pretty awesome resource- because you can talk about things that maybe we don't cover in the group emails like our thoughts on current culture, events, etc... Welcome to the 4th Floor and Friends Blog....Blog away and enjoy :)
