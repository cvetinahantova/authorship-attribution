Thanks to the Power of ebay, I have an undisclosed number of 5lbs. bags of beef jerky being shipped to my house. More to come when they come...  But I'm also looking at buying a digital camera. It's not a smart thing to do financially, and I owe my mother money, but, since I’m going to Israel, I would really like a camera I can take good pictures with, specifically, the  urlLink Canon Powershot s50 . I suppose I could purchase a less expensive camera, but I’ve used this camera at the  urlLink JCC , and I like it, I trust it. And when it comes to a purchase like this, trust is extraordinarily important to me.
