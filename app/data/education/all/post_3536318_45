...for figuring out the commenting problem.  (So if you're on one the thousands of people that contact me everyday about how you're unable to post a comment, then here's your solution:   Hi Paul - more interesting insight (ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz...........) into the "Comments" - I finally experimented enough to figure out what "allowed" me to finally access and post Comments on your site. What I have to do is, after getting to your Blog, hit the "Reload" button on my Browser. Once I do that, I can comment to my heart's delight - without doing that, when I hit "Comments" - nothing happens. I did this experiment on both IE and on AOL - and it worked in both. So... RELOAD, RELOAD, RELOAD!!! You may want to mention this to others who may be having the same problem.
