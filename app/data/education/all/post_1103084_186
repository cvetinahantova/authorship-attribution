................................ Truth is overrated ................................  (the following are characters based loosely upon an actual conversation)  Joe: We're gonna win it all. We're gonna get to the tournament and win everything.  [silence on the van.]  Joe: Well?  Andrew ?  Whaddya think?   Andrew: I think you've got two of the three principal virtues going on -- faith and hope -- so that seems good.  Ryan: do you really believe that those are the three principal virtues?   Andrew:  Um. They're Pauline.  The church affirms them.  That's my tradition.  I guess so.  Ryan:  Well it just  seems like there might be other virtues.   Andrew stares out the van window at the passing cornfields.  Lots of passing cornfields.  It's Ohio after all.  Ryan interrupts his reverie.  Ryan: What about truth?  Shouldn't that be one of the virtues.   Loud anthem-like Rock music fades up in Andrew's head.  YEAH, that's the point, Ryan, he thinks.  Truth is overrated.    It's not a commandment.  It's not a fruit of the spirit.  It's not one of the three principal virtues.   Ryan:  Or integrity.  Shouldn't that be in there.   Exactly, Ryan.  Integrity must be understood in the shape of LOVE faith hope patience gentleness humility LOVE.    truth is contextual, relational and communal.  And THAT truth is underrated, i'm thinking.
