Still no call, no text, no IM.  And guess what?  I'm not going to do a god damn thing about it!!!  Moving on to the next prospect.... Jake, Atco, 21.  Today was my first day of waitressing.  Not a bad job, but I worked my ass off.  I probably worked as much as I did when I worked at the Home Depot.  I made $65 in tips actually waitressing from 11:30 till 3:00.  Not bad at all, Julie says.  Not much else to report.  Feeling pretty damn good about myself, actually.
