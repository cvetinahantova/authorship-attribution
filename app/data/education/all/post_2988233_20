Guess what?  my Dad took me to Sam's club again, I am a blessed woman.  I now have, a box of hamburgers, salad dressing, mayonaise, ketchup, butter, bread sticks, nutty buddy bars, kerosene, salad lettuce, whoohoo, we are eating good tonight, oh, and I got nacho cheese sauce too.  We love nachos around here.   I talked to mom about the thing with Shane, she doesn't even remember saying it.  BLess her heart, she is 80 years old, she has black spots in her memory,and when she gets loopy like that, she can't remember a thing.    Tommy came home from work in a better mood.  He even went up to mom and dad's and went in.  Pass out, he went it.  My mom has always been able to get him to talk,a nd they talked for a little while, well, I guesss I should say mom talked and Tommy listened.    All in all, so far, a good night.
