I managed to pull a muscle in my back this morning.  I slept all wrong and aggrivated it while I was at the gym.  This proved for a pretty week work out.  Got tickets to see Troy so I'll let you kids know how it is.   In sad news it looks like Tim might be leaving sometime soon for good.  If this is the case then we need to get crazy this weekend b/c it will probably be the last weekend I can see him since I'm heading out on Wednesday.  Arabian Night's looks like a go.  We need a cool Korean to come with us.  Anyone who has a cool Korean laying around let us know.   I went to the travel agent and got things squared away and I then to the bank to see about travelers checks.  I'm ready to get out of here and hit the road.   I've been doing a really good job keeping up with e-mail.  I'm very proud of myself. I hope I only have 5 classes today.
