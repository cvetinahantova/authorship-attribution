I love email.  I love blogging, because when I get a comment, I get email telling me so.  I check my email far more often than I actually receive email.  It's a little like before caller ID, when you could *69 to see who your most recent caller was (useful if you took the trash out when you were waiting for HIM to call).  Of course, the last call was invariably from your maiden aunt, reminding you of your mom's surprise birthday party Sunday afternoon, but you persisted in dialing the magic code, because  you just never know .  So comment away folks.  I need the email.
