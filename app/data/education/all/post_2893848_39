Should I become a postman?  I'd have to give up Cheeba because they  definitely  drug test, and philosophical objections, gallons of water and internet miracle flushes aside, it would likely be many months of ascetic self-denial before I could even  seriously consider taking the civil service exam.  But the pay is  good, and I could grow that handle-bar moustache I've always wanted.    Unrelatedly, I'm glad and mildy self-consciousthat in my two-week absence everyone has been posting so much.   I guess I was smothering you guys.    Chicago is great.  I'll write more about that later.  If anyone wants to pick up some impeccable slack until I have my own internet access, please let me know.   Then again, at this point, I've probably lost all my readers anyway.    Barrack Obama is my new hero.   I know Kerry has adopted Langston Hughes's line, "Let America Be America Again," but watching this badass speak, the better line seemed to be "Let the Democrats be the Democrats again; the party they never were."    Did anyone else catch David Brooks's comparison of Obama to Tiger Woods?  What an ass.  Whenever I see him on Jim Lehrer, he talks like he's fighting back the self-conscious and bitter tears of a playground victim.       I'll see some of you in Philly.  If anyone wants to come see Modest Mouse and Deathcab for cutie in Chicago on August 14, you can stay with me.
