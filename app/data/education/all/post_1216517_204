usa.  home sweet home.  i suppose.  i need to take 15 showers to remove my central american scent.  it's kind of sad to see (smell) it go.  im excited that im back in the land where the keyboards have question marks ?  and quotations " and at-sign thingys @.  im still addicted to the glorious haze of travelling though, don't get me wrong.    i'm not enamored with car alarms, mcdonalds, hummers, phones that chime out nelly and 50 cent, traffic jams, smog...but its my home.  i love to travel.  i always will, but i need a home.   and im here.  nap time.
