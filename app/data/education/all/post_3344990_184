Chapter 36-  I was made for a mission    Verse to remember-  Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.  Matt 28:19,20    Question to consider-  what fears have kept me from fulfilling the mission God gave me to accomplish?  What keeps me from telling others the good news?   Give the right opportunity and timing I have no fears about sharing with others who Jesus is to me. On page 286 the book states �to fulfill your mission will require that you abandon your agenda and accept Gods agenda for your life�  So that brings me to this question.  What is my agenda?  I sometimes think that my agenda is to survive life from one day to the next.  How much time is consumed by pursuing a paycheck so I can pay the never ending flow of bills.  Bills are like washing clothes.  Once you start the cycle you never seem to stop.  You start out in this process by controlling the process but after awhile  the process can take on a life of its own and begin to control you.  I owe I owe off to work I go is my motto every time I head out the door to work.  The pursuit of money so I can keep my head above water is a large portion of my agenda. The bible states that if my faith is the size of a mustard seed that I can move mountains.  How much faith do I have for God to meet my needs when I spend most of my waking hours working for a paycheck.  Instead of being a kingdom builder I am doing everything I can to maintain a certain level of existence.  Poor financial decisions and unfortunate circumstances has me in this place.  To be a good steward I must work so that through me with Gods provision I can provide for my family.    The second question that comes to mind is this.  I have people in my neighborhood on my street that I do not know.  Am I lazy?  Perhaps I am just too wrapped up in my agenda.  I need to figure out how to simplify the tasks in my life and free up more time to fulfill Gods agenda.  What is God blessing in the community I live in?  How will I ever know if I don�t take the time to look around and ask God to show me?  The other thing that might keep me from sharing the good news is my natural desire to hide the things in my life that would affect the integrity of the gospel.  It is one thing to be an effective speaker or be able to present the facts.  It is another thing to be able to speak Gods word with integrity and power and confidence.  Paul could say � Do as I do� with regards to being the example of a Godly man.  I know that there are moments in my life that reflect my humanity and sinful nature.  When those things come into the light it damages my testimony of who Jesus is to me.  How can I share the good news to a non believer when I have moments when I am a bad ambassador for Christ?  I know that in my weakness HE is strong.  What about the times that I chose to willfully sin and deny the power of God in my life?  How much integrity will my testimony be then?
