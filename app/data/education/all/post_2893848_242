Bombardment by Scott  I'll say that the Red Sox and the Cubs (cultural implications we're talking now) have more in common than being "cursed." That the BoSox and the Cubs have continued to lose is an indeliable mark on their personality, and there are other factors: the neighborhoods are similar, the ballparks each have a quaint and substantial history, the beer is expensive and bad, the fans are highly disrespectful to the opponents. Fenway and Wrigley are the last monuments to a different period, a modernist ideal of classicism and form coming together to withstand the test of time and marketing. It's ridiculous that the Red Sox even be compared to any other baseball team. The White Sox live in a bright shell beside the tollway express lanes. There are gigantic pinwheels affixed to the upper deck. You can buy 10 different kinds of beer. You could also get ribs, if you are a real Postmodern baseball enthusiast. Working-class the Sox are not. Between the Cubs and the White Sox, I'd say you have to go with the Cubs because the Cubs stand up to what the Modernist wants out of baseball. Granted, the south side of Chicago is poorer than the north. The north is crammed with yuppies. But this in no way suggests that the Cubs are more haute coulture. It just fortells the story of Chicago, which is that the Cubs happen to be located within a more taxable real estate area. That the Cubs continue to play quality Modernist baseball belies the yuppie occurences in the surrounding area. Do your careful research, but I don't think two teams in baseball hold more in common in terms of personality and essence than the Cubs and the BoSox.
