These photos were taken during my commute to Yonezawa, from Tokyo. I quickly learned that I would have to keep my camera at the ready, otherwise the shinkansens (bullet trains) would vanish out of sight.  There were a couple of varieties of shinkansen that went by while we were there. The two most interesting ones were the ultrasleek stupidly high speed variant (not pictured), and the double-decker version (*sigh* - also not pictured). I did manage to get photos of the type that I travelled in though (hooray!).   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
