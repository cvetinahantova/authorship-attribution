urlLink Christian Question and Answer Epistles   We just celebrated Good Friday and Palm Sunday.  Easter is on April 11, 2004 and as you know there will be people going to church on this day that do not choose to go to church any other day of the year. Why is Easter so important that people buy new clothes and go to church on this day?  Perhaps buying clothes is not the issue but we all know that there are people that will go to church to show off their new duds.  Well, anyway, Easter is coming and it is VERY significant to those of us that identify ourselves with Christ by saying HE IS the LORD of LORDS and KING of KINGS.    We have all asked the question.  Should christians participate in pagan holidays such as Easter and Christmas or Halloween?  This question was posed and answered and I thought the article was good enough to share with you.     When you click on the URL I posted above you will need to scroll down past the dialog box where you can ask a question.  You will see a list of "past" questions posted.  The question I am talking about is the FIRST question.  Click on that link and you will be taken to that article.  Thanks     God bless
