Okay, I really really wanted to write something depressing and be all pissed off about stupid crap but I'm not gonna do that. I feel frustrated about a lot of things in my life right now and how everything is so unpredictable and how Zack keeps trying to erase this entry! I finally got to talk to Ashley last night, which was awesome. I just hope that we can become really close again. I just don't know what she wants yet. It's all good though. I know that everything works out for the best so I will just have to wait and see. I love you all very much and call me if you want to do something.
