The only free phones there are on the Mix-It thingy, are: Nokia 3100 (it glows in the dark!), Segum MYX2 (my father has it, so that is a big no-no), Nokia 3510i (EVERYONE'S got it), and T-Mobile's own phone- LGGD7050 (dinky and with a camera, I LIKE IT!) The T-Mobile people are telling us different things from the web-site. Silly people!
