I feel so drained today. I don't know why, as I've done nothing that's really required a lot of energy. Well, I had a driving lesson; they always seem to take it out of me, seeing as they're so damn stressful. We did awareness, anticipation and planning today, all of which I was rubbish at. I'm so envious of people who can drive.  The Leavers' Ball is tomorrow. It'll be the last time I will see a lot of people with whom I've spent the last 7 years co-existing, so it's going to be happy, sad and strange all at the same time. Maybe in 20 years I'll run into someone in the supermarket, someone I wasn't that close to, and we'll squint at each other, and say each others' names unsurely and then have an uncomfortable conversation about our lives now, and whether we still talk to anyone from school, which we probably won't. Alternatively, even worse, I could run into Laura/Becky/Debbs/Selina, with whom I'd lost contact with over the years, and we had nothing to talk about. I think I might just move to Leeds. And then JYF finally occurs on Saturday! Huzzah. My sorry ass will arrive in Nottingham at 11am, hopefully, and then for the next 36 hours much fun will be had by all. Twice.  So here ends my first day as a proper grown up. Thoroughly wasted, I think you'll agree. Only 3 more months of them to go...  Ceff x   If I only had a notion...
