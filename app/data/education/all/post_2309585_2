You represent... hope. You're quite a daydreamer and can be a hopeless romantic.   You enjoy being creative and don't mind being alone at times.   You have goals, and know what you want in life... even if they are a little far fetched.   urlLink   What feeling do you represent?    brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Amazing how one can become so suddenly inspired. For whatever reason. I pulled out the photo albums of my trips to Central America in 1993 and 1994 and started organizing them into scrapbooks. I'm feeling creative and accomplished right now, I must say!  This is it for the year. See you in 2004!
