She is away at the moment, camping in Devon....is that why we have rain and thunder storms? - LOL.  I really miss her, we have met once since our "split" and we got on really well. We went down to her local pub on a glorious evening and spent the night catching up over a pint! It was good to be able to see her and talk to her properly. We had been limiting ourselves to the odd chat on MSN and I had decided not to be pushy and give her the space she needed to make up her mind where she wanted to be, in terms of our relationship. I am glad I did, because things seem to have turned out OK. I can't wait to ring her and hear her voice, but at the moment my moble phone has been disconnected, but that's another story!  I had really hoped to be joining her on the camping trip for a couple of days, but with the combination of poor weather, the reluctance of the doctor to give me time off and that fact that the company I work for on Saturdays have left me an urgent message to contact them in the morning about my job at the weekend, it doesn't look as though I am going anywhere.
