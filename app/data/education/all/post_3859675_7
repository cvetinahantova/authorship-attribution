Hello, this is the first time I am doing an online journal. I want to do it to help encourage others, let them know how I am doing in my struggles, and how life is doing. I have been struggling with sin as always but I know God is faithful whenever I need Him.   I have been out of school for the summer and have not much to do until mid-August. I just need to find some good books to read and to start reading them. All I have been doing this summer so far is trying to lose some weight, get healthier, and taking the kids (my nephew, and my 3 nieces) to the Summer Matinee Movies every week.   I have also been trying to get together with some brothers and sisters-in-Christ to encourage them. It seems to me that the summer seems to be an interesting time. It seems that folks have a harder time growing spiritually; I have been having that problem as well. I have been finding harder to deal with life because I have so much free time because school is out and all. The problem is boredom can bring sin, I am currently looking for more to do until August.
