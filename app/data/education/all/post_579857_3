Greetings in the name of Jesus!  i will fast from tv. well except for basketball. because it helps me chat with nonChristians at IMPE. anyways, here's why...for lent i fasted from all types of Law and Order. believe you me, that was tough. it's my favorite show. there's lots of drama and a feeling of compensation and closure at the end. none of the relational drama i know about.   anyways, being summer and kinda bored down here in the apt alone, i've taken up a lot of television watching. so now i will fast for...forty days. i hope i have the right heart in doing this. in place of TV i will read, read and read. cuz i dont read much. i will still watch movies if it means i'll be spending time with people and building relationships for God's glory. basically, i'm fasting from wasting time, letting TV fill me unhealthily.   i will break fast after June 30th, so we'll see where i'm at July 1st. God help me!  By His grace and mercy, Gill
