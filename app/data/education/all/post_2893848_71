Soap River   By IJ   I was walking across the Burlington Street bridge today in Iowa City and it looked like someone had dumped a couple tons of laundry detergent into the Iowa River.  The suds piled so high as to almost touch the lip of the dam and extended all the way down to the Benton Street bridge, about a halfmile down river.  What the fuck?  Does anyone know why this would be?    There's a scientific explanation for everything, I guess.  But that's so final.   I myself prefer pseudo-scientific explanations, because there's about a million explanations for everything that way, as opposed to science's measly one, and hey, they all might as well be correct.  One explanation is that with the recent thaw, the extra water is rushing over the dam at a greater velocity and more air is working its way in.  But still, this stuff was foamy and sticky, clearly something more than just water.  Perhaps a better pseudo-scientific explanation would have something do with salt in the ice and/or snow.  I was pretty confident about that last one until I wrote it down.  Any notions?
