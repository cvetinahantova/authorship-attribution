urlLink The Ronald Reagan Library    President Ronald Reagan (1911-2004) died yesterday at age 93.  There is no tragedy in his death as he lived a full life and his last days were spent in "twilight."  Regardless, I mourn the loss of the man who set the course that buried the Soviet Union and may have saved the world from nuclear war as a result.  Here is the note today at the Ronald Presidential Library:  Mrs. Ronald Reagan issued the following statement from her home in Los Angeles, California:  "My family and I would like the world to know that President Ronald Reagan has passed away after ten years of Alzheimer's, at 93 years of age. We appreciate everyone's prayers over the years."  If you want to send condolences, please visit www.reaganlibrary.com. The Library will be closed for a minimum of 7 days beginning June 5, 2004. We appreciate your understanding at this time.  R. Duke Blackwood Director Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
