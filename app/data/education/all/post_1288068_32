Like all Scots-in-exile, I spend many a gin-fuelled evening waxing melancholy about the Old Country; how blue the skies! how pure and life-giving the water! how cheap the property!  Thankfully, I only socialise with people polite enough not to ask why, if it's so bloody great, I don't bugger off back up there. Bless 'em.  Anyway, the boy has now booked tickets for our biannual jaunt North, first to his place on the beautiful  urlLink South coast , then to my parents in the  urlLink Borders .   No, it's not a holiday per se, but it is an excuse to behave like a teenager for a couple of weeks next month. Woo!  In related news, the excellent  urlLink Chris Cope  points out this hot Borders story -    urlLink The Devil, I tell you!
