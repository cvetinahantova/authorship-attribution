What a fun day it's been! I got to go to school at 7:00 this morning, which is the hardest thing to do because I don't learn well when I'm sleepy, but I also got some homework done (yeah being productive, I prayed in our group on Sunday that those of us who are in school wouldn't be procrastinators) and I got to go shopping! I was so happy because I needed to books for my Literature class so I went to Barnes and Noble well I thought that I had only 7 dollars on a certificate that I had so I would pay three dollars for my books, but I had 17! Not like it is a real big deal but I didn't have to pay! One kiss from the King. And then I went to Abecrombie because once again I thought I had 7 dollars on my certifcate so I got a cute shirt from the kids abercrombie, they have clothes that fit me which is sad. Anyways I got another kiss from the King because I again had 17 dollars so I ended up paying a dollar which is awesome!  I am so excited because my mom's birthday is coming up, my dad and I set up a day of relaxing and treatements at Dolce Salon and Spa, and I get to get a facial too! It will be fun mom/daughter time, maybe we will make a beautiful moment of our own. hee hee.  Gabe had an award ceremony tonight for making all state for Soccer, it was nice because his coach who is also the english teacher wrote a descriptive paragragh of how Gabe was such an awesome leader and player. It made us proud that Gabe got such an honor. I was trying not to sit to close to him at the dinner because we don't like people to think we are dating, ha ha. Then he takes my hand and kisses it or sits closer just because. Silly boy.
