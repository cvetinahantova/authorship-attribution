urlLink Challenging technolust: the educational responsibility of librarians  This is by Alan Bundy of the University of South Australia.  This paper was presented at the annual conference of the International Association of Technological University Libraries (IATUL) held at the Technical University of Crete, May 1999.  From the site:  The high expenditure on information technology in educational institutions is occurring too often for political reasons, driven by technolusts; a quest to be perceived at a technological cutting edge which will always be a mirage; and commercial interests which have fostered information technology anxiety and competition within, and between, countries. Even senior educational administrators are vulnerable to the siren sounds of the technolusts and their proffering of an educational panacea and change agent through information technology. This is a danger in developed countries. It is much more so if developing countries conclude that information technology is the solution to their educational deficits. Because they are heavy and effective users of information technology, librarians, more than any other profession, have a balanced and discriminating view of the place of information technology in education. They are aware that the fundamental educational issue is information literacy, not information technology. This awareness needs to be reflected more strongly in library mission statements, to provide an overt basis for the contesting of any educational process or expenditure which does not have enduring learning and information literacy outcomes.
