IT'S A BACKPACK LIFE FOR ME  I went surfing at seal beach on my day off monday to celebrate the presidents.  it was dope.  i want to do it more often.  i hung 10.  i did a ridiculous amount of spring cleaning the other day.  I gave away 2 garbage bags of clothes, 2 boxes of books, and threw away 2 garbage bags full of absolute crap.  i win.  I'm finally becoming not a pack rat.  woo-hoo!  pat me on the back when you get the chance.  it's been a long journey.  i keep everything.  I think i have the receipt for my birth around somewhere.   but seriously, every movie stub, receipt from road trips, homework, the list goes on.  it's crazy. i went through a bunch of stuff, but you could have just thrown away boxes from my garage when i wasn't looking and i wouldn't be able to tell you what i was missing.  it's sick.  materialism, man.  it's a killer.  many times i've said i want to go minimalistic.  i still do.  i own no furniture.  it's on purpose.  i hate bulk.  i still have 3 boxes full of books though.  i couldn't bring my self to part with steinbeck, hemingway, keroac, and the rest of the boys.  you know how it is.  but if i could carry everything i owned in a backpack, i'd be a happy man.  pipe dream, i know, but i can dream can't i?  I have a dream that every man rich and poor will carry all their posessions on their back...ok i'll shut up now, but consider it, eat up my words, young sages, for they are wise and will bring healing unto your souls unto the 3rd and 4th generations...or maybe not.
