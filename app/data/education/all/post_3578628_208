Today I was out shopping.  This was the fun part of my day because later I went to see an oral surgeon.  He told me all about the fun I'll be having when three teeth are pulled.  Can't pull all four.  One might get infected.  We set a date, Aug 17th.  My summer is going to end a week earlier.  I'll be full of pain and insane.  I'll get to take it easy in band unfortunately.  I'm sorta happy about that.  It'll be kinda weird not marching in the first game, but that's what will happen.  Here comes another big plan of mine.  ONE WEEK IN ADVANCE... Friday 13th (ooh spooky!) or Sat 14th.  I want to make sure we do something but FIRST, let me know that you are free and interested.  Then we can all work out something to do before I get my teeth pulled.    Oh I watched Secret Window and Open Range...Both good movies but watch Open Range when you have lots of time...Watch Secret Window cause Johnny Depp is great.
