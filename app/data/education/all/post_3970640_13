When I was young I worked at our small town library.  Not much exciting happened there, but we did have this one patron who would sign his name and in one fluid motion draw a little hand holding a pencil at the very end of his signature.  All of us girly pages would squeal with delight when he entered the building and we’d all vie for the chance to check him out (his books!!) because then we could be close at hand when he wrote his famous (to us) signature.  It didn’t hurt that the man was good looking, but we really were interested in his signature too.  People don’t much care about their signature now a day.  You don’t have to sign for you books at check out – it’s all computerized.  I suppose celebrities practice their signatures, but that would be about it.  We’re in the computer age and your signature is a cute ditty at the end of your email.
