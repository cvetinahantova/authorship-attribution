I really hated having to move my blog, but I really didn't want my family to read about me.  I don't need their criticisms and such.  Also, I don't want to post about them, and not know as to whether they would read it or not. Ya know?  So anyway, now that it is the butt-crack of dawn.  I will head off to bed feeling a bit better about no one in my family being aware of this site..except S.  He's the only one. Ever.   I hope
