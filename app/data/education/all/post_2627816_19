Shane's Download Of The Day   Today's Download is an IM client that can access all 4 of the main instant messenger networks, as well as IRC.    Trillian   Don't you hate it when you have to sign on multiple instant messengers because your friends are all on different ones? Well... with Trillian, you only have to have one open! Trillian can access AIM, MSN, ICQ, and YIM at the same time! It is also skinnable and has other cool features. Trillian Basic is free (no ads or anything but missing features) but Trillian Pro is plain awesome! If you like Trillian Basic, I reccomend paying the $30 for Pro. You won't regret it!   urlLink Trillian
