Speaking at Estero High School in Florida near Fort Myers.  Making a new friend, Dr. Jones, who works in the parking lot of the school.  Wonderful audiences.  Full of energy and very supportive administration.  Spent the rest of the day with Micki (my mom) on jet skis in the ocean...until we tipped over.  Don't ask.  Found a great sushi and thai restaurant.  Great day.
