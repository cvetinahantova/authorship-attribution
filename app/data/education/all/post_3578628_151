Alright, I found a game that everyone should check out.  It's great.    urlLink http://www.gamegarage.co.uk/info/122/   I also want you to go check this out too:   urlLink http://www.jibjab.com/   Just click on the big funny picture that says "CLICK TO PLAY".  I know you'll have your doubts but these are worth checking out if you have a little free time.  Just ask Josh Hall...he loved them.  Continue to enjoy summer!! Later!
