The following points come from a relatively interesting and well-done study published in  JM  by Steenkamp, Hofstede and Wedel (1999), "A Cross-National Investigation into the Individual and National Cultural Antecedents of Consumer Innovativeness."   Our knowledge of why consumers differ in their innovativeness is still sparse (Gatignon and Robertson 1991)  Studies have found the disposition of innovativeness to positively correlated with optimum stimulus level, independence, extraversion, impulsivity, risk taking, tolerance of amubiguity, inner directedness, capacity for status, and flexibility and negatively correlated with dogmatism, conservatism, need for structure and need for clarity (Foxall 1988; Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1992; Venkatraman and Price 1990; Zuckerman 1979). [sidebar: another study I looked at shows that dogmatism is not related to early internet adoption, which doesn't surprise me.]  Findings from the empirical portion (which is crosscultural and includes several EU countries) of the paper are as follows:   Conservation (conservatism) lessens innovativeness  Consumer ethnocentrism reduces innovativeness  A more favorable attitude toward the past lessens innovativeness   The cultural findings probably aren't of interest to us -- but here they are:   Degree of individualism in a culture increases innovativeness  Degree of uncertainty avoidance in a culture decreases innovativeness  Degree of masculinity in a culture enhances innovativeness  There are some interactions between culture and personality that are interesting, but not relevant to our study.   Oh, and as concerns age:   The authors used age as a control variable -- as in Venkatraman and Price (1990), age is associated with reduced innovativeness.
