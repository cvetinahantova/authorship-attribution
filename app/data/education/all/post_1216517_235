in honor of those of us who are near the sea, or those of us (me) who dreamed about it last night, here's a fun one that jangly old gloyd will want played 24/7 in 70 years when he is in a nursing home   PIRATE LOOKS AT FORTY  -  urlLink jimmy buffet   Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call, Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall. You've seen it all, you've seen it all.   Watch the men who rode you, Switch from sails to steam. And in your belly you hold the treasure that few have ever seen, most of them dreams, Most of them dreams.   Yes, I am a pirate two hundred years too late. The cannons don't thunder there's nothin' to plunder I'm an over forty victim of fate Arriving too late, arriving too late.   I've done a bit of smugglin' I've run my share of grass. I made enough money to buy Miami, But I pissed it away so fast, Never meant to last, never meant to last.   I have been drunk now for over two weeks, I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks, But I've got to stop wishin', Got to go fishin', I'm down to rock bottom again. Just a few friends, just a few friends.   Instrumental   I go for younger women, lived with several awhile And though I ran away, they'll come back one day. And still could manage a smile It just takes awhile, just takes awhile.   Mother, mother ocean, after all these years I've found My occupational hazard being my occupations just not around. I feel like I've drowned, Gonna head uptown.
