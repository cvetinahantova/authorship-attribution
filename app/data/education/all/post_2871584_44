Thankfully, the past two days have gone much better than Tuesday did.    I woke up Wednesday morning to maintenance knocking on my door, as expected.  They came in, and took care of the bathroom first.  Then they looked at my fridge, and since it was brand new when I moved in, told me that they would have a brand new one for me by the end of the day.  The only bad part?  I had to move my whole kitchen around so they could get the broken one out and the new one in.  Oh well.  It could have been worse.  I now have a working refrigerator.  Yeah!  Once I moved everything around in my kitchen, Nicole and I headed out for another college visit.  This time we went to Ithaca College, which was even nicer than Binghamton was.  I was seriously amazed by the way that most conducting programs seem to work.  Nicole is almost sure that she's going to be applying to Ithaca, although she may also do Binghamton as a backup.    When we got back to Utica, I didn't really feel like cooking, so we went to Zebb's for dinner.  Afterwards, we came back here, had a few drinks, and watched a couple of movies.  One of them was "The Whole Nine Yards" which was not at all what I expected it to be, but *very* funny all the same.    This morning, I woke up to my phone ringing, although for a good reason, and since it was already 10:30, I couldn't really complain.  Nicole and I went out and did some shopping.  We hit a few different stores.  I restocked my freezer, and I bought an air conditioner!  Wee!  Tim said that he would come over and help me install it, and then my apartment should actually be bearable for the summer.  Thank God.
