Ok, so I went to the Emory Spine Center. They diagnosed me with Spondylolsis...I don't really know what this is. I do know that it has to do with my neck/shoulder area. I have to go to physical therapy twice a week for a month. The physical therapy referral form noted that I would be doing the following therapeutic exercises: stabilization, strengthening, stretching, and soft tissue mobilization...sounds interesting.  Tonight I went to one of my favorite places,  urlLink Barnes and Noble . I  LOVE  to read and listen to music. It’s kinda weird and maybe a little freaky but I get the best feeling when I am in the store. I can’t totally explain it. I feel relaxed, smart, motivated, and excited. I also feel a little overwhelmed because there are so many things that I find myself wanting to read!   In the music section they have this new listening center. You can listen to the top selling 100 CD’s. You are able to listen to the whole CD! I heard of a relatively new artist,  urlLink Jem . It’s not the Jem from the  urlLink Jem and the Holograms  cartoon many of you may remember. This Jem is from Wales and her debut CD is “truly outrageous”! All kidding aside, the CD is really good. This quote regarding Jem’s music was taken from her  urlLink website , “a fresh and distinctive new sound. Jem's music is a combination of bright melodies, soul-searching lyrics and diverse rhythms that grab you from the first listen. Her seemingly innocent lyrics contain those closely observed details that are as much about optimism as they are about discovery.”  I also purchased two new books:  urlLink Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris  and  urlLink Little Bitty Lies by Mary Kay Andrews . I can’t wait to read them…by the pool…if Atlanta ever has another sunny day…
