A special welcome to Lynn,Chad, Deborah, and Jerry for creating and posting to the class blog.  I must admit that I wondered what we were about to get into when I was asked about "blogging"!!!  I liked your thoughts about how to use a blog.  Do you have any other ideas about how you would use the blog in your classes?  carol deal
