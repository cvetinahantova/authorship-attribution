I had every intention of getting up today, and doing a once over on my apartment.  I figured that if I got my cleaning done today, tomorrow would be a nice day of relaxation before Nicole got here.  Yeah.  That was the plan.    When I woke up, I had absolutely no motivation to do anything.  I did manage to wash some dishes, and clean the kitchen, but that was as far as I got.  Instead of cleaning the rest of the day, I read outside for a while (it was a beautiful day) and then watched "Dogma."  Now I'm watching a four hour stint of "Law and Order: SVU" and even though I've seen all four episodes, I really don't feel like doing anything else.    I guess that means that today was my relaxation day.  Tomorrow I get all the fun of cleaning the rest of my apartment, and washing some sheets and towels.  I'm hoping that it will be a dreary day, and that might act as a motivating factor.  Eh.  We'll see.
