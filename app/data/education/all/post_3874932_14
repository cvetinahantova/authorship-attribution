I've spent some time going through Everett Rogers' book (a 4th edition was printed in 1995).  He certainly has better examples and a better discussion of diffusion and adoption than I ever had in class.  Concerning cosmpolite people -- the idea is that they are earlier adopters because they tend to look outside their local network of people for new ideas and innovations and are thus more independent thinkers.  Later adopters are more likely to have adopted when others within their "local" network have adopted.  The case of senior adoption is interesting because I think there's more of an early adopter/no adopter split.  The first 25% that have adopted (I think that was IDC's number) may be just about all that will adopt.  Fully 80% of our sample answered 1 on a 10 point scale, indicating that they have "no interest at all" in adopting the internet.  The sample of folks that are still interested (above 5 on the scale) is so small that I can't even use any variables to predict who is still interested.  One thing that seems to be missing from our data is the year when Seniors adopted.  I think I had this in an earlier version of the survey and I thought that Carol Glasheen had indicated that it was in the panel data, but it's not.
