Haiyaa ... Yesterday I didn't come to school because I'll be having my qualifying exam on Saturday. I had been practising Maths the whole 'morning' not until I grabbed my a$$ to logon to Internet and met my long-lost family... Well, not really long-lost, just that we never knew each other before though we were both closely related... and he was online.. before, we only connected through  friendster.com  and yesterday, we were chatting together till afternoon.       Syarul ... he's my nephew, the son of my cousin from my dad's side. Frankly speaking, I am not that tightly close with the family from my dad's side because they're much-much older than I am. I even got grandchildren from that side... So, he called as '  babu alai  ' which I rather heard it cute and glamour~ We talked so much about stuff and he even gave me testimonial which is the most unique and funny testimonial ever. That man is so unique! So, he was @ Miri, yesterday. He stayed at my cousin's home there... I added my other's nephews e-mail add and even friendster... I think I want to make a bond with them. Not  JAMES BOND  but  family bond ...   It was raining heavily again yesterday... I watched  Athens' Games  the whole noon till night. Finally I cut off my nails... No more pain!!!       "You misjudge me for not being me. Why was I to blame when I did nothing wrong?? I don't know why my heart is so painful when I think about you... You are special to me. I realized that we were not meant to be together. No more tears and laughter... But you know what? I am  cool  now. I am fine with all the decisions you had made. I don't hate you though my heart is broken into pieces because of you. I am professional and I got the attitude. You don't have to care about me anymore because I will not be. This is the end of our lives... People said that friendship will never ends, but you and me just end it for an absurd reason... I hope you will think twice after this because life is worth a while... Goodbye!"        Happy Birthday (12th)  to my cousin,  Md. Hazwan Nabil ... May God bless you. May your life will be filled with prosperity and joy. Be happy always (and I know that you do)...  Adangtah main PlayStation atu...  Study hard for your success... And I'm praying for your safety and success always!!
