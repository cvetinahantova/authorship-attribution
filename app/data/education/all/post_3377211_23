urlLink    Look at me with awe and wonder you puny nerds! I recieved a REAL letter from the greatest author of the past 30 years, Stephen King himself! Apparently, even Mr. King realizes that I am the new God of Cool, and that's why he's asking only me to join his club. The best part? The two books he mentions (Carrie and the Stand) are the last two books I need to complete my Stephen King collection! I must be the luckiest man alive! Sometimes you just have to wonder how stupid these companies think people are.Â  urlLink
