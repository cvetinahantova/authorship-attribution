I took a look at I, Robot preview and thought, "Wow! This is hokey."  It's just it's interesting but I felt like it was missing the element that movies like Minority Report and Paycheck have.  Right now, I question my idea that this movie could be so bad.  It opened and made 52.3 million beating out his (what I think are better movies) films like Independence Day (50.2 mil.), Men In Black (51.1 mil), and Men In Black 2 (52.1 mil).    For any sci-fi movie, you have to be able to buy into it.  But with an actor like Will Smith leading the way, you can almost count on people loving it.  I was watching Never Before Scene on MTV.  The crowd loved what we was doing in I, Robot and truthfully, I think I have changed my mind.  At some point, I want to see Will Smith's new film.      (Note: This does not excuse Waterworld from being one of the worst science fiction films of all time.)
