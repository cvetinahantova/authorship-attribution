Hello All I'm adding your comments to the posts so everyone can read them more easily.   Deb   July 19, 2004 I never had the good fortune of meeting George, but enjoyed knowing him through email and through reading his books. It was truly my pleasure to build his website at http://www.rdavidhunter.com. He was always kind enough to surprise me with signed copies of his books which I enjoyed very much and will treasure. I know your family has suffered a tremendous loss from his passing. I wish only the best for you. Sandy Meier
