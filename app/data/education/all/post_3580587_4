Raining cats and dogs.  I love that saying.  I guess today was one of those days.  One of those raining cats and dogs days.  And, just 'one of those days' days.  A big outdoor event I was supposed to take part in (work related) was cancelled because of the weather.  I found that out after I got there & drove around looking for people who weren't there.  But there were other people there.  Austinites.  They certainly looked the part.  Slightly rumpled Columbia clothes, unshaven faces, and loyal dog at foot.  And they all drove nice cars, too.  Dirty cars, but I suppose it was residue from all the rain.  Anyway, it made me wonder what they do.  Do for work, I mean.  My first thought was that they were writers.  Maybe not all of them.  But a good number.  As I'm writing this, I wonder if any of them are professors.  Off for the summer.  I wonder what they do in the summer, anyhow.  Hmm.  Walk their dogs in the park on a rainy day, I suppose.  "The Book of Questions" has been sitting on my computer desk for a couple months now.  Think I got it back in 1997.  The questions have remained the same (it is a book, afterall), but over the years, some of the answers have changed.  Hmm.  Question #1: For a person you loved deeply, would you be willing to move to a distant country knowing there would be little chance of seeing your friends or family again?  Answer #1: No.  I would never live in another country.  Don't think I would ever 'deeply love' a person who supported living in another country, especially with 'little chance of seeing friends or family again.'  And love is no reason to make such a rash decision, anyhow.
