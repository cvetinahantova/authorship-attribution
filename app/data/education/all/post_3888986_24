I ate a whole lotta shit yesterday.  Coffee-   3 pts  Granola bar for bfast-  3 pts  4 turkeyslices and a piece of cheese-  3 pts  Granola bar snack-   3 pts  Cheese dip and flat bread for dinner (ugh... how terrible when it is in writing)-  LOTS of points.   Water= 2 glasses   BOO  :(  That is it.  I drank Crystal light raspberry lemonade all  day... free points.  Soda=  None ... hooray for me.  (dentist said no more soda... so i'll report that too)  Excersize:   none  unless you count painting.  my calves are killing me, and I sweat my ass off.. but I wouldnt really call it cardio.  1-10 scale of the day  (1 being super dieter- oprah, and 10 being  fatty fatty boobalatty- goodyear blimp) about a   6.5
