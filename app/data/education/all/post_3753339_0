Work:  Margot's back.  Please.  Comments:  Margot's back!  We did our usual thing yesterday--lunch @ Makeda, going to the bank, running other errands, and basically catching up on things.  I graded like a madwoman last night, and a lot of the papers were very good.  I prepared for class, went out for a very late dinner with Margot, and then we hung around a bit more until she grew tired.  Not much was done, and I didn't write a thing (not to mention the fact that I didn't exercise).  I also spent a bit more money than I would have liked, but I don't think it will be the end of the world.  I did not hear from the insurance company today.  I watched part of a horrible Red Sox game, and mapped out my academic schedule until Thanksgiving--what a nightmare that will be!  If I can do it though...wow.
