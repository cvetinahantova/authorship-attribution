i found it so hard to concentrate in school the other day. i couldn't help thinking of jammi. i couldn't help imagining him seated on the empty chair beside me. even sir ralph passing by and the hard chacha lessons in PE couldn't take my mind off him. i just couldn't believewhat we did last sunday.   jammi and i talked for the whole afternoon. i received my first guitar lessons and we ended up doing it again. he started it, asking what i was wearing. needless to say, i was wearing pink[it so happens everytime he calls, i'm wearing pink]. then he joked me about liking it if i was wearing nothing. so i pretended to be serious about maybe being naked the next time we talked. i got so anxious when i realized one thing was leading to another. before i knew it, i was feeling the same rush of energy in me like before. after that, we both felt weird since we weren't supposed to do that anymore because we're no longer lovers. but, then again, i liked it.  the next day he called. after 20 minutes of helping me tune my guitar, he asked me to go online. his voice started to sound serious and i asked him why. he said he was gonna do his homework first so i insisted he do his work first. but then he told me it was my payment for the lessons and he was gonna tell me something important but he can't say it at that time. i was expecting him to say "i love you" and it made me too giddy. when i went online, he told me something that i don't think i can take. he said, after i said goodbye, he started smoking again and got involved in shipment of marijuana. he told me he didn't smoke pot but i was still upset. he said he wanted to let me know how disgusting he is as a person. i asked him why and his reply was, "cause i didn't wanna lie, worse, cause i care about you." but still, i didn't like him being like that. so when he told me to punish him, i told him to give me a call when he stopped.  bad decision... i miss him like hell...again... i just did it because i love him... so much...
