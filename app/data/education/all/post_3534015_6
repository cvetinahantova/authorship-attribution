It's early by some people's standards.  Rather late by mine.  It is so beautiful outside.  I love my office, I have a view of the entire escarpment from here.  It's only mediocre in the winter, but in the spring it is LOVELY!  I don't really have alot to do today.  I haven't really had alot to do in a while.  I do admit to feeling a wee teeny tiny bit guilty over my complete lack of work, but when I'm not given work, how can I complete it?  So I spend my days posting on forums and playing games.  My new online "home" is the Canadian Idol forum.  I joined one week ago today and I am at 200 posts.  I either totally rock or totally suck, I haven't decided yet.    I have had other blogs over the years, but they inevitably fade away, probably because I am not convinced anyone reads them.  This one serves a different purpose.  It is a gathering spot for pictures, poetry, and prose.  All my random writings will go here.
