Okay, so I spent Saturday/yesterday spazzing about how he went to Mid-Winter without me, and crying and stuff, and we talked last night. Oh my god. He apologized! I don't know why, but it was the sweetest thing in the world. He was afraid I was mad at him. I am so in mother-effin' love with this boy, ah. I don't know, but I'm slowly trying to convince him to go to prom with me. Yeah, plan ahead, so no more tears.   I sat in front of him in history, and it was so amusing. I don't know. I swear, we act like more of a couple than actual couples. I'm slowly dying, being with him, his touch, he is my sin. My best friend who I want like so badly that I feel like crying. I can't control it. Seriously, I think he feels it too. I'm scared as to messing up our friendship. It's so weird. Best friend/therapist/boyfriend? Hah. I don't know. I just want him. He is my savior. He keeps me strong, and not wanting to die all the time.
