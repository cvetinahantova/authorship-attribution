I took my students to the food musuem today. It's quite far away from my school and thus, we had to take a journey that had given me a big carsick before I knew anything about food of mankind.   The visit was OK. The so-called musuem was a bit too small. There were a lot of pots and plates from different countries like Egypt, Middle East and China. Varieties of coffee and tea were introduced too! I must say I admire the creativity of the Mongolian as they invented a very funny yet practical pot to make skimmed milk tea!!! What a health- concerning race!  After the visit came the real stuff---chocolate making! All my students longed for this 'special' event since they arrived. I sat with my boys. (A very good proof of opposite sex attraction works for all age!) One of my favourite boys made, a volcano I would say, rather than a piece of chocolate. We all had a good laugh for the chocolate we made. TOO bad I didn't bring my DC.   My students promised me to send me the pics they had taken but I only received one......
