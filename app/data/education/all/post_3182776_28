Today was meant to be spent hunched over, typing like a demon in the shadow of teetering piles of text books, grinding my teeth as black coffee flooded my system through intravenous drip-feed. Instead, some higher power has sent me a gang of recently graduated design students with a stack of kung-fu movies on DVD and a penchant for computer generated violence. It's so hard to resist the lure of the living room settee and those ergonomic controllers that fit so neatly into the hand... So much easier to conquer pixelated worlds than to overcome 2500 words on educating the able in New Cross. I am so WEAK!  This morning I hauled myself into town to buy books and discovered the marvellousness that is Foyles. Why has nobody told me about this place before? There it sits, like a poor relation opposite the shiny corporateness of Borders, looking like just another of those cheap-ass bookstores, when actually, it's like ten Waterstones stacked one on top of the other, so filled to bursting is it with wordy wonders. And the art section is HUGE! I shall never frequent another chain-store again.  I also saw Brian, the erstwhile Big Brother star and occasional TV presenter at Liverpool Street station earlier. He was orange, and chubby, with a daft hairdo. That was my first London celeb-spot in three years, unless you count Lee Hurst on Bethnal Green Road, but he lives here, so I reckon that's kind of cheating. Anyway, I think it's sad that Brian's gone a bit to seed, but touching that he still takes the tube like normal people. If I was famous there's no fucking way you'd get me on the Central Line anymore until they fix the air conditioning. Celebrity culture is arse, but London Transport are top of my list of People Who Will Be First to Get It When the Revolution Comes. Wankers.  I must away. The kitchen is calling.  Happy Saturday, one and all.
