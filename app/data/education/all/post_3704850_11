Hey guys:  Since it's easy to forget to check the blog from time to time, I've turned on the feature that sends out an e-mail to a specified e-mail address when there is a new post or a comment made.  For this, I created a mailing list on Alma's mail server.  The address is:   urlLink web.project@alma.edu   Anything sent to this address gets sent to all 5 of us.
