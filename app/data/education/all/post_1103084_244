in which a number  of  wise  men sit at a dinner table and discuss a wide range  of  topics.   purge the gender from this one -- and i've found a greek term for one of my favorite activities...  Utne's  urlLink salons  focus on a similiar idea...  the  urlLink lets talk america  people focus the idea upon how the political sphere might be reshaped if people seriously committed themselves to the power of talk...  ...but *good* conversation doesn't draw arbitrary lines around what is *political* and what isn't (as if *anything* was *ever* not political)...in fact good conversation really engages *any* topic as being worthwhile...  ...food, time, and engaging people seem to be the most important components...
