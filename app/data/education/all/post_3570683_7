urlLink    I got the idea for the hair, the broken handcuff, and the boots from other dolls, I can't take credit for that, so don't think I'm trying to steal the dolls, I just can't remember where I got them from!  I thought the pieces were cute and reproduced them, trying not to make them look exactly the same... so I would be using the original as a model, but they still look copied and pasted... gaypher  Posted by  urlLink Hello
