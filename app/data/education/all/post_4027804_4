Driving school starts at 5 pm. I am awake at 12. It is 4:30 and I have still not had my before-going-out shower. It is 4:50. I still have not gotten ready to leave the house.   It is 5:00, and I'm in the shower. 5:30 I get there, late as usual (I promise, being late is like a trait that will run in my future family...::shakes head).   It's now 4:49. How did time go backwards? It did not. It is 4:49 the next morning, however, I am still not tired.   I think I'm becoming bipolar...either that, or I end up changing attitudes differently than I thought. For some reason, being out alone makes me mad at people, and well...>.>      urlLink
