i can't decide...is it better being at home or living with the boys?  it's really a toss up. i think i've decided that it would be best not to come back home unless it's necessary.  sure, i love seeing my family...but our house is so messed up and my family really is dysfunctional.  sometimes it just really makes sense why i'm the way i am.  nobody really knows about it...and everybody thinks i have a perfect, "normal", "real" family but the truth is that we're not normal and we're far from perfect.  and a lot of screaming goes on, although that's the worst it gets.  i really hate arguments and yelling.  i've realized that i'm a lot like my dad too...which sort of frustrates me.  not that he's not a good guy or anything, but he's forgetful and is super defensive and takes everything the wrong way...and we don't get along a good deal of the time.  i hate to think of myself having those same qualities but i know i do.  i spent a good hour of my night cleaning up dog vomit.  the dog i'm petsitting for must have gotten sick today and threw up quite a few places.  not my idea of fun, that's for sure.  i hope there isn't more to clean up tomorrow.  they are coming home tomorrow so that will be nice not worrying about her being sick.  one of my new year's resolutions is to start writing in this blog the way i should be writing in it...and keep it from being a place to just complain about things going on in my life.  we'll work on that.  and one last thing...is it so bad to call it the "fridgerator"?!?!?!
