On the way home from work I was listening to a science program on Radio 4.  They were doing an experiment on personality types that involved lemon juice and cotton buds.  The hypothesis was that Introvert personality types produce more saliva than extroverts.  This is because they tick over at a higher level of stimulation and so are excited by the taste of the lemon juice more than extrovert types.  This explains why I am content to do stuff (reading, drinking coffee, sitting around) that others get fidgety and bored about.
