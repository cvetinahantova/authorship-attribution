Okay, I am sitting here in Computer Apps. bored out of my mind and so I decided to finally hit up my blog again.  Things are coming back together in my life and maybe I can have the rest of the year with no more downfalls. That would be awesome. Jesus Christ is the friggin man. Number one! I'm starting to listen to country music, which is scaring me, but its pretty kew!I am passing in school finally and straight chilling. Love you all very much! I won't be online anytime soon because I have no computer.  ...................You'll think of me.............
