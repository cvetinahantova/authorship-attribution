Pulse of the Nation   Like any good sox fan, I feel a responsibility to make enemies who  urlLink will never even bother  to hate me back  (Who ees Pete Coco?).  In the interest of this, I have printed many pics off of  urlLink Dirtdogs , many of them photoshopped wonders; A-Rod in swim trunks, holding his wife, in a bikini, from behind, both in a fountain.  An almost heartwarming scene, but for her  urlLink head .  Then there's my personal favorite, Saddam Hussein in a yankees cap.  To this, I have added a speech bubble, in which Saddam accuses A-Rod of  urlLink the very act  previously reserved for Jeter alone.  I keep these things on my refrigerator.  I would frame them, but that might creep out my girlfriend.  Better to affect casualness.   Meanwhile, there's a fussy fixture in my kitchen and I am convinced that it will someday crackle and spark to my dog's, if not Adrienne's and my own, doom.  Recently, this light stopped working and we had to call our landlord.  Did he replace the fixture?  Of course not.  He stood on my kitchen table and jiggled the sockets until there was light.  (Isn't it funny how people can sometimes make you feel foolish by beong incredibly reckless?)    He did, however, leave the following note:   Tenant,  I replaced the bulbs but the fixture is old and next time we'll have to replace it.    Thanks,  Maintenance  ps- you're right, A-Rod does swallow.   And I live in  Iowa .
