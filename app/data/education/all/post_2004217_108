urlLink    So...tired...Â  urlLink     I am far too sleepy considering I had a good 6 hours sleep last night. I went to Netherstowe School again to see Third Enigma with Kat, Draper and someone called Andy, then stayed over at Coz's. I didn't even have anything to drink or (ahem) over-exert myself, so God only knows why I'm totally shattered now. The band were ace again, but I didn't expect any less, in fact, they were better this time around. The rest of the evening consisted of defending Hells Is For Heroes to too many people (Blink 182?? EMO??? Tis not normal...), stressing about coats and being disappointed at the non-stunningness of Draper's friend. When we went back to Coz's we watched about 3 films which all seemed to merge into one, leaving us with the feeling that we'd watched a film where a boat with Dean Cain on it sank, before he climbed into the air vents of a house that was on fire, only to see a woman being chased by Jedis/Dan from Big Brother before she stabbed the bad guy in the eye with her nail file. All excellent films, I think you'll agree...  So... Draper. Think. It was a half-and-half situation for me last night: half the time he was annoying and obnoxious, and half the time he was strangely attractive (surprisingly good music taste- always does it for me). Despite what everyone says, he's a nice guy; he's chatty and can be quite gentlemanly when you say the right thing ("I'm cold" = "Do you want my coat?", "I need to get dressed" = "Do you want me to go out?"), and although sometimes he makes comments that are waaay innapropriate and kill the conversation, when you think about it, everyone does that sometimes, it's just he does it a little more than other people. Give him a break! He's not quite ace, but he's alright...  Ceff x   As you sleep, when no one is listening I will lift you off your feet, and keep you from dreaming...
