It's amazing how much mischief can be caused while your parents are off in LV for 3 days... I didn't do much except go to a barbeque at Justin's house and watch  Bourne Surpremacy  with Patrick at Camera 12 on Sunday; then Monday came along and boy, was that quite a day. I didn't wake up until about a half hour before Bub came to pick me up to go see Anchorman. After the movie, Ollie picked me up around 2ish and headed over to Stanford shopping center, found that there was really nothing there so instead we decided to watch Napoleon Dynamite because of the added scene to the end. How 'bout that.. 2 movies in one day. =P After that spent the night at his place, and..um.. well.. ya know ;-)
