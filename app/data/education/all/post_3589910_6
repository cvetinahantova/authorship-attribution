Yes, and no, I didn't misspell it, I just write it like that to make it kind of unique. And Faery is the original (one of them) word for fairy. I'm not a pagan or anything like it. I must admit though I'm interested in those subjects but to do not practice them. I live in my faerytale, inside my mind and soul. Anyone might think, "how childish" or "how immature". But you know, it's good, because sometimes is hard to deal with some stuff of the outside world. And I'm one of those who deal with them without killing myself over them. But there are times I must escape this reality so harsh. I see it so beautiful every day even though is actually bad times. Those are the benefice of a child's heart. As I always say:  "I want to live with the heart of a child and act with the wisdom of an old soul".  I don't live in luxuries or anything like it, so I'm not a real princess... Actually I am, everyone of us is. Why? Because we are all God's children, and He's the King of kings and so that make us Princesses and Princes. I've had like... 10 blogs more or less since I can remember but this one is not for me, it's for Nephelle, my inner child. Hehe, yea, I gave myself a name. I thought, well, if I'm going to live so much in this world of mine, I might as well give myself a name for that world. I'm not different in any way on both world, I'm actually the same crazy little girl at heart, (I'm not that naive) who never wants to grow up. I have my own diary but here I'll write just to escape reality a bit. In my diary I write real day to day events and feelings and all. Here... Lets say it will be a bit of the same but with a little of faery dust. So there you have it, an introduction to my own faeryland.
