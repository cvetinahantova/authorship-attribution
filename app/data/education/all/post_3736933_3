What a fabulous gift. This is my first entry of many, and I am sure I will have a few stories to tell, and if you know me, I am sure you are nodding your head right now. I closed another chapter today, my last day working at UTS in the Faculty of Education Student Services City Campus. My stomach bloated (from my fabulous good bye luncheon at Cafe Otto )as I contemplate how to find the words to describe the wonderful people I have been working with since September. The memories are many, the laughs and tears I have shared. I hope I have definately left something with all of you guys. I know I haven't been much of an office worker, but I hope I have been someone who's spirit, you will always remember. Well I think I have a voice you will never forget, hey Shalini, or should I say Shazza Mazza!!! Well I love writing, but this is something new for me, collecting my thoughts and typing them into a computer. So bare with me, and my entries as I begin to learn how to use this site, and hopefully add some lovely pics! I will take you on my little adventures, and the dramas of just being me. First stop Athens, Greece. So I will sign off for now, but don't worry I will post a new entry very soon.
