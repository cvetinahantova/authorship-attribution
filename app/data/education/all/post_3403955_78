I know there is no real possibility. Us being miles apart. But when I dream I dream of you. A dream so sweet it make me think all of my dreams can come true. My dreams are quite simple, just me being honest with you. Something I would hope to do someday for real, to be able to tell you. Tell you how I feel when ever your around. What your smile does to me or when I see you standing in a door. Just the thought of you give me tingles all over and causes my heart to speed. You always know just what to say you always know what I need. My fear of telling you my true thoughts and feelings? Quite simple I am not sure if the risk is worth losing. I have risked before and lost not just the hope but the friendship that was built. I would rather care for you from up close then have you not like me from a distance. So I call you friend and share your joys and such. If one day it would work then that time will come to be. Till then as a friend I will be happy for you as you are for me.
