Hello!  My name is Sweetheart and I am a parakeet.  Actually, I'm a budgie.  I am just a baby, and I was hanging out with my brothers and sisters, and all of a sudden, a big hand captured me!  I spent a little while in a dark box, then, all of a sudden, I was in a small room and some big human was chasing me around.  I finally got into the cage on my own.  I think the human was a little relieved.  I am still a little scared, but the human comes over to my cage a bunch and says, "Hello, Sweetheart!" and "Pretty bird!" to me.  When she does this, this big white thing (although smaller than the human) comes over, too, and makes a "wooing" sound at me.  The human says the white thing is a dog.  I think its name is Maddie.  I'm sure I can get used to both of them, they seem pretty nice.  Maybe some day I'll even talk to the human. She keeps telling me that she's my human mom.  I can tell she likes me, but I think she gets a little scared when I get scared and try to fly around the cage.  I can't fly real well because the people at the store gave me a haircut so that some of my feathers that help me fly are gone.  They said that it's for my protection.    Ok, I'm going to go play with my toys now and maybe eat a bit.  Talk to you all soon!
