I hyped them last week and this week I got the record, which will be released in the U.S. on May 4. So here's the deal:  I thought I was going to to be  so  original in picking out the Cocteau Twins stylings of Delays, but  urlLink everybody  beat me to it. It's mentioned in every review! You really notice it on my fave song on the CD, "Wanderlust".  This record is as ambient as the album title: you expect to hear seagulls and wind through your headphones. There's also bits of REM and The Sundays here and like "Long Time Coming" reeks of something I cannot pinpont. They cover a lot of ground and despite it being a bit derivative, it still sounds fresh compared to what's out there now.
