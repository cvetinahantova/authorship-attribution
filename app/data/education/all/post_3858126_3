So I went shopping today in mighty Tesco (an oversize cornershop that sells everything except...well, best not go there!) and I decided it was time to find out what had been happening in the celebrity world. I picked up a copy of  urlLink Kerrang  music mag so that I could catch up on the rock news and a copy of Now! to find out the ins and outs of being a 21st Century celebrity.   So: Britney is happy with her dancing boyfriend (so?)  Sadie Frost has gotten over her times with Jude Law at last.  Leslie Ash got broken after a bedroom session, contracted an infection and is now starting the recovery period - she can walk again now. (that's some bedroom session)  The fifties are back in again!  Elizabeth Jagger and Sean Lennon are an item.  Jay Kay and Amanda Donohoe are an item.   Anyway, more later.   Love y'all!   I have now found an amusing site which reminded me very much of those years gone by when I had  urlLink technical problems  in my life. Check out this advice page for help.   Or maybe you just want to throw a  urlLink baby  about. WARNING: giggling becomes annoying!   urlLink Bushisms  perhaps?  Extracts from  urlLink letters of complaint ?  Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy
