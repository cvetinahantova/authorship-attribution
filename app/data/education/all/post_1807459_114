Have I really not updated since Sunday?  Where has the time gone?  I feel like I have no free time.  I seem to be seeing a lot of movies lately.  I saw The Hunted last night and it was pretty bad.  But in Korea that really doesn't matter.  It entertained me and that's about all I ask for.  I've been seeing a lot of Gyeh-son lately.  I think  that's where my time has gone.  I'm surprised she isn't sick of me.  Ok I don't have much time to blog b/c I have work coming up.  Nothing too eventful has happened this week.  I think this weekend should be pretty giver, at least I'm hoping so.  Oh I found a board game cafe where we can drink.  This either has disaster or fun written all over it.
