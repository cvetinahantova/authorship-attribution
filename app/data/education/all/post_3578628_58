We're back...new and improved with your considerations in mind!  I found another article while searching for something and came across this:  Foreign countries are now starting to decree that flying foreign country's flags during athletic events is a sign of DISRESPECT!  Yes, countries across the sea are beginning to believe that flying their components flag is disrespectful to the HOSTING TEAMS COUNTRY.  So far the US and Canada have not taken part of this new "scheme."  As for our opinion here, it should be considered more disrespectful to your country for NOT flying your opponents flag during an event because it shows how stuck-up you are.  Hopefully the US never stoops to this level.
