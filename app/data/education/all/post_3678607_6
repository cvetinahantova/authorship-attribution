Yesterday, I was asked to complete an online poll for Harris Poll Online. The email claimed that for ten minutes, you will get 30 HIpoints (you get points for the polls you take). However, by completing that poll, the sucker you in for another, "Would you like to answer another poll [approx. 30 min.], for an additional 200 HIpoints?" Of Course I would! I have no life and all the time in the world! So I did, and it was very time consuming and BORING! So, after I finished that one, "Would you like to answer another poll [approx. 10 min.], for an additional 50 HIpoints, making a total of 250 HIpoints?" Well, duh! If I did the last one, why wouldn't I do this one? So I did. I will never do that again... Oh, who am I kidding, I can't turn down a $5 giftcard to The Olive Garden for 800 HIpoints! I need more, more, more... !     I am such a sucker...
