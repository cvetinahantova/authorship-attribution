I think I have to go to Houston this weekend!!! The dumb italian consulate.  I have to try to get a visa to go to Italy and I just received all the documents from the School I will be working for and now I just need to give them to the italian consulate.   IN HOUSTON!!!!  I would like to call and ask them some questions...but they are only open from 9:30 to 12:30 -amazing!!!!!  I am literally freaking out right now. What about the garage sale? What about the research I was going to tackle? What about cleaning my car to sale? What about my freakin' sanity?   This whole thing is beginning to be a HUGE ordeal. I mean, i'm not an idiot. I knew I had a lot to do, but I am in gridlock at this point.  I am sitting here with it all in front of me and I can't get any of it done because I don't know where to start.   I need a clone.  At this point that whole issue with the embrio cell thing...i don't keep up..well anyway..not looking so bad right now.   GRRRRRRRR..i'm out....to scream or somthing.
