The time has finally come, and for an hour and a half, i packed everything i could POSSIBLY need for the next 5 weeks. I admit that i have never seen a better packing job in my entire life! LOL... so, 2 huge suitcases, a duffel bag, and one rollerblade strapped onto a school bag later, and im all set to go! [btw, the other rollerblade is in the duffel bag... you know... right underneath my pale yellow dress shirt. seriously.   Anyway, i leave tomorrow at 11am... oh my goodness! only 11 hours to go! bye!
