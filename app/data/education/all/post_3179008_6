It has been a while. I have been busy now that there are more students in the class. Plus, we now have two females in the class, which certainly shakes things up in here. It also effects the rest of the classes, since one of the girls we got recently is good looking. She also is "friendly" with males. As you may know from reading earlier posts, most of the students we get are emotionally, sexually, and/or physically abused. This girl has had many relationships with males older than her.    At this point right now, one of the male students is threatening to hurt another male student because he spread rumors about him and this girl. This may appear to be normal type drama for the age range, but this kind of situation can lead kids without impulse control to do drastic things, which can be dangerous and highly regrettable.    She has now just returned to class in tears, manipulation and bipolar episode rapped into one, and has asked me to take space at tables outside, away from the male student in our class. I suggested that she would not be in staff sight, and that the male student isn't in the class right now. She agreed, and asked to use the restroom. I think she will just sit and cry to see who bites. I'm not buying it, but I do have sympathy for the fact that she uses the methods she does; learned behavior. I also have the benefit of know some of the group home staff that work with her. So, I have gotten some inside info. on her behavior at home. And, by saying "behavior," I don't mean to imply negativity, but a nonjudgmental view of other perceptions. Difficult, but I can do it about 70% of the time.   I am not cold-hearted, but I won't help this 17 year old girl unless I make it clear that I am not going to be a part of her methods of operation. Of course, I do this with as much tact as is possible in order to maintain a relationship with the student. What a dance it is.
