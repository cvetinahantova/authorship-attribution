Ok, a cute little Christmas story for you all...  At my sister's school, they have a Korean exchange student named Yoo Young. She's in band with my sister and her gang, and she hangs out with them, as they are all charmed by her incredible cuteness. Anyway...she asked my sister if Santa would be at the band's Christmas concert. Well, we've had the same guy play Santa for the Christmas concert for years now, so Haylee said yes. " Real   Santa?" she asked. Turns out that in Korea, Santa is seen as a symbol of goodwill, but they know that in America, he's the bringer of gifts and so on, so she was really excited about the prospect of meeting the actual Santa Claus.  So, Haylee spread the word around not to ruin this for her, since she still believes in Santa (and it would crush anyone to learn the truth when they're thousands of miles away from home). And when Santa came out to greet the crowd at the end of the concert, her face absolutely lit up. And, since she was too nervous to talk to Santa by herself, Dad took the liberty of introducing him to her (she trusts Dad, since he's her director and all). She sat on his lap, he ho-ho-ho'd for her, and she walked away absolutely glowing. It was such a sweet and fun moment. Here's a pic I snapped of the two of them...  (Pic coming as soon as I can find where my mother put the bloody disk!)
