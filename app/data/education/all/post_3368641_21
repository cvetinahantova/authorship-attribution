THE SORROW HOLE   I have arrived I say this long climb up through the darkest hours has left me empty my eyes do not open or register another dawn  the rain falls like troubles as nature cries the tears that I have been unable to and I walk to the deep woods and collapse in this sorrow hole in hopes of it drowning me  I've held the blade and the bottle of pills I've stared down the barrel and leaned over ledges I've died to myself so many times that the skeleton of my good days could find no calories to sustain itself  It is a life of lies that has kept me  distracted from my self too close to the truth and it burns my fictitious  point of reference away  I lay down in a pool of my own  unconscious making tonight either the rain or pneumonia or insanity will truly know me as the fool I really am consciousness fades...  I am alive I say one more dawn  to meet my disappointment one more day to find my way out of the sorrow hole  (For a lost friend)   Â©2003 DC Vision
