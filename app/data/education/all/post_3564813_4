THPS4 is actually really good! I had the oportunity to play THUG a couple of months ago round a friends, and hired it that same day, however after playing it for a couple of hours I decided it wasn't for me. I didn't like it. This is a different story however, I actually like number 4.  Anyway, I also changed the skin, to give the blog a nice clean look, lol, I have to say, i've only been blogging for a day, and I'm already obsessed with it! I really do think everyone else should have one! I really like the way you can share your diary with the world. Did you realise that these things even get turned in to books?  Imagine... in a couple of years time you could walk in to a book shop, and pick up a book/blog that you read years ago? Well, don't say it doesn't happen.  Tomorrow: Well, I have to go to Media Club after school since i'm doing Media Studies next year, last time we went we filmed a short movie, it went like this.   I was a teacher guy, who walked out of the door, I walk around a corner. You next see Darren, on his bike racing past. I stop him, and tell him to walk back the way he came because he shouldn't have been riding his bike. Next, when he is on his way back, he talks with a friend, still riding his bike. I shout at him and he takes no notice and speeds off, running over James in the process.   Pretty crappy, huh? Yeah it maybe, but just remember this was our first time. Anyway, tomorrow we have to go back and edit what we did. Can't wait. Oh, we also filmed some staff leaving, at one point when *name edit* was leaving on his bike, it actually looked like he was taking a piss while what he was really doing was adjusting his bike helmet. Oh well, smile, your on camera!  Anyway, going to go now, watch the monstrocity that is Eastenders. Wish me luck, this programe is really shabby, but somewhat adictive - "Ohmah, are you coming home for tea?".
