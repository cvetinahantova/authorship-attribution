i just read lyle's blog and all i could say is that i don't have a chance. man, i'm so desperate for a the wrong person...AGAIN. ano bang bago??? my brother was right, i'm the one chasing ugly people not the other way around which is supposed to be. did i just say lyle's ugly? nevermind that, it's something everybody calls "sourgraping". whatever.... he and yang are very much in love. he and yang are of the same age. he and yang have through a lot. compare that with this: me and lyle were not even close to aqcuaitance. i'm 4 years younger than lyle. lyle and i have a lot in common but what's that gonna do? man, i'm getting my feelings wasted all over AGAIN.  i never learn. i just live in this weird fantasy of mine while ignoring the fact that it just wasn't meant to be. he said opposites attract. opposites attract my ass. i'm not gonna fall for shit men[which are only two for the time being..were pala] tell me. hey, i've been with guys years older than myself. no wonder i grew up to be a stupid complement to men. i've been fooled too many times. i guess i really should just wait for my time.  but, hey, i could always keep my little fantasy that maybe lyle does like me. nah, that's too big. maybe he liked my "kiss". ah, that's more like it.   man, i've wasted too many weeks missing him. he has his own life so he can't always talk to me. i've got my own life, too...that was meant only for him. KIDDING!!  bahala na...talaga...
