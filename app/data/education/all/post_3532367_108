The kids had their school report last night, in general we were very pleased with them. The only problem is that Rob is moving into a class, with a teacher that we are not that keen on. At this stage, they keep the same teacher for 2 years, so Sandra had some concerns. We both went in this morning to discuss it with the Head. She was surprised, but tried to allay our fears about the teacher concerned. We can't pinpoint the issue, just a gut feeling, that she is watching her time go by, until she retires. The appointment made me a bit late for work, but who cares, sometimes the kids come first.
