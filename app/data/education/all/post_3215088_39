Came back from camp today ....this time rd is Kranji Pri School. Had this grp of campers that really made my day. I was supposed to leave the camp on Wednesday cos i wasnt involved in the second part of the camp. But these campers in one of the grp made me feel appreciated. They were not even my "kids" cos i was just helping a colleague who is new to the job....so i attached myself to the grp for a few hours to help him lor. After lunch, i am supposed to leave the camp already and the kids asked me to stay back with them. Haha...they funniest part is that the actually dowan their instructor and wanted me. This is not good cos it is in a way undermining my colleague. Tats y i decided to go home first and not return that night so as to give my colleague more time to build rapport with his kids. Nevertheless, the kids made me feel that i must come back and help them and him . Went home on Wednesday and back to the camp on Thursday afternoon. I neber expect to receive such warm welcome from them cos i oni took them for less than 2 hrs on Wednesday.  Even the camp 2 i/c who came in midway thru the camp thought i was the grp instructor for that grp...hahaha  When i walked past the canteen ( they were having lunch) , they actually remembered me and called out to me. Had alot of fun with the grp...too bad did not conduct the night walk for them , if not i will scare the hell out of them...hahahaha.....  The main purpose of me going back to the camp is to support the campfire I/C who is doing it for the first time. These colleagues were a bunch of great peers and i think the least i can do is to support him by helping the kids prepare their camp fire presentation well and keep the spirits high during the campfire. Guessed with the ful support of all the grp instructors, the campfire was super smooth and good. The grp i attached myself to also did very well.   Too bad my camp days for this holidays is ending soon. Sigh. Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
