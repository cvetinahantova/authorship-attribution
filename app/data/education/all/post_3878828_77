ONLY 16 DAYS! (and 16 is my lucky number). So I thought today would be the perfect time to start my own kick *ss web page. Everyone should have a blog! I've been packing and shopping and studying and worrying and getting excited and emailing alot. How is there so much left to do? I got some new tapes for my vid recorder today so I'll be putting up some digi pics eventually. I hope I can get a laptop. It would make keeping up with this blog alot easier in Tokyo/Oshima!
