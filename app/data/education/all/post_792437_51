The wonders of food..    Â  I find it interesting that even the most evil of enemies can sit down and be so happy and cheery when they both have food in front of them. Why do you forget hate, forget whatever, and just start playing oh so nice, when you would never be like that when you were hungry?Could the food be enticing people to act that way? And if that's the case, maybe I should use food to get many things....I'll jot that down...There's more to the story, but I'm too lazy to write it..
