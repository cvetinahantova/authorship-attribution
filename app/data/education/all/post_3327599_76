wanna know something funny about hate.. it takes so much emotion and time. another feeling like that is love. so love and hate really isn't that different now is it? so the previous statement has nothing to do with anything other then being completely consumed by hatred is a horrible way to live. it's better to just let go and not care anymore, indifference is healthier then hate. dont hate me, just dont care.      ok so now that i said that.. yesterday Sheila and i went to the vet that was fun. and after that Phil and Sheila and i went to see Napoleon Dynamite. it was really funny. the FFA comments were greatly appreciated. it made me realize that in all our movies about high school it's always about jocks and cheerleaders and geeks. what about our future farmers? none of us really fall into any of the previous categories.. some of us can be considered "special" lol but that's about it. how do we spell girl Kyle? gril? and what about respect? respcept? Aretha Franklin would shoot him if she knew how bad he butchered that song... i'm really gonna miss Redneck Ray and Banana Head this year. who will we make fun of.. oh i know! Teri! lol jk. ok so anyway, after the movie i went to Phil's. we went to walmart around midnight which was really funny.. and stood in line forever because no one knows how to work those self checkers. anywho around 1 this afternoon i decided i should drag myself home. only to take andrew to blockbuster. i spent the rest of the afternoon watching mortal kombat and playing the legend of soltar. (aka solitaire for those of you who are retarded).
