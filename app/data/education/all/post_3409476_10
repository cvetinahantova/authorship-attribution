I have an interview on Thursday for Administrative Secretary Confidential in the Public Information office at the District.  For those of you that aren't aware, I am looking for a new job because the school I am at will no longer be yera round as of the 2005-2006 school year, which means I will not be a 12 month empoyee.  I will have 8 weeks off in the summer UNPAID!  My last resort is to get a new job outside of the district.  I have my transfer papers in to try for any open 12 month 8 hour positions.  So keep your fingers crossed for me.
