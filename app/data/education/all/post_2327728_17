I was highly annoyed on Monday.  Wholy unsatisfied with everything and everyone about covered it.  Perhaps it was hormonal.  Either way, my attitude about Halifax is starting to change.  I am no longer down about living in this city I hate, but I am frustrated and angry!  To add insult to the already injurous city I live in, three of my favorite hangouts have closed.  Are you kidding me?  Seriously, though.  I don't understand it!  How do people live like this!
