I forgot about this until I burped. I know that is sooooo gross, but it was nasty then so the recurring nastiness just makes it worse. I had a grilled cheese and salad from the cafeteria for lunch. The grilled cheese? Oh, so good! I was in Heaven. The salad? Not so good. And here is where we get to the nasty cheese.  The salad had what appeared to be nice, yellowish orange cheese on top. I'm thinking, "Mmmm cheddar" because I am such a cheese freak. R. says I was a mouse in a former life. Anyway. I take a nibble, and, oh God, the horror! It had this powdery texture on the outside that reminded me of how latex gloves feel on the inside. Ewww. Then, to make it worse, the cheese tasted faintly of cheddar but more like really rotten bacon flavoring. Gross! I wanted to yack. For real.  To make it worse, the tomato and the cucumber both had hints of nastiness to them as well. I can't place it, but it was almost a meaty flavor that frightened me since they are veggies.  Oh...I'm shivering just thinking of how gross it was!
