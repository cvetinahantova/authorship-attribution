It's about 3:30 in the morning on Teusday, we're staying up the last night we're here. Probably end up sleeping in the cars on the way home, meeting Zak's mom somewhere to pick us up... I have no idea how we're going to fit all our stuff in her car. Don't think we'll be able to fit everything in the tiny little sports car... Oh well, whatever, it'll suck if it doesn't work out. Whatr you gonna do?... Having trouble staying awake, I'll make it through the night, just won't be a breeze. Drinking Mountain Dew... Been drinking it for a while, sorta stops working after a while, probably help a little... Just doesn't give me a caffeine high. Still playing games, gonna start a Freelancer server... |)u|\| r311y W4|\|7 70 p14y, |\|p!! Yeah, havin fun and stuff... Umm, want to type more. I have it in my head right now, just can't get it out for some reason or another.  Was talking to Katherine around 8-8:30 and things  seemed  to be fine. But suddenly out of no where she says shes gotta go and doesn't know or whatever, that was different... I tried to get her to talk to me before she left but she said her dad was yelling at her, I think it might've been a lie to go... :\ umm... yeah, so I'm kinda lost atm. Got really frustrated that she just left without saying anything else, hate it when people leave without explanation... Can't fucking stand it! Uhg, ok... So yeah, played some freelancer and now finishing this post. Ttyl...
