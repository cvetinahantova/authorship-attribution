Last night I ventured to Rifu to see the movie TROY!  Yuko and I picked up Steph from Hon Shiogama (train station closest to my apt) and headed into Rifu.  We decided to buy our tickets first because 1)it was ladies day which means females pay 1,000 yen instead of the usual 1800 and 2) in many theaters in Japan you have to chose your seats.  Yes, reserved seating in movies theaters!  We then walked across the parking lot to a ramen shop and quickly ate and then returned to the movie theater to meet a couple other teachers.  Needless to say the movie was really good and Brad Pitt was definitely worthy of writing home about.  After the movie we ventured over to Coco's Cafe for dessert and at nearly 11 PM I ended up back in my apartment ready to crash.  When you leave at 7:40 AM and get home at 11 PM,it is quite the long day.  The teachers at Shiogama Boys are so much fun.  I will definitely be missing all of the jokes and crazy antics that always seem to occur when Yuko, Nitanai sensei and I are together.
