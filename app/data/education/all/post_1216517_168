HEATWAVE!  It is so freaking hot!  Yesterday the thermometer supassed 95 degrees and today feels the same.  A couple days ago it was in the 50's.  I went from using my heating to using my fan overnight.    Yesterday afternoon I went to downtown L.A. to the Los Angeles Islamic Center to hear a couple talk that spent the year in Baghdad.  However, The LA marathon was going on and blocked my path to the destination.  I ran in the marathon for 2 blocks.  I was passing everybody.  of course, they were all on mile # 26, but hey, whatever.
