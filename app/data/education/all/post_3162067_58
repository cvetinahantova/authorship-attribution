Finally got some feedback on the job I went for 2 weeks ago.  I think it's quite positive. We liked G****'s CV - it was very clear, contained all the relevant details and her statement of intent was excellent and a very useful summary.  When it came to her skills section she might consider bullet pointing this so interviewers can see everything at a glance.  As for the interview, she came across well and answered all the questions clearly, we also liked her honesty when it came to her teaching background and the reasons why she left it.  Unfortunately, there was a stronger candidate for the post. So at least I'm not totally useless. Very lonely right now.  The morning and late afternoon is always a time when I miss human-interaction the most.  Yes, I have the rats to keep me company but I do miss my friends.  And I feel a bit headachey and dizzy.  Gonna go now - this PC stuff ain't gonna help my bad back. Oh, and thanks to Blogger for taking my comments on board.
