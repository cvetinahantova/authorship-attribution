I haven't had a chance to say too much on The Local Cafe.  I have been thinking of something to write about and I thought that I would ask anybody who would like to help with me and many others efforts to help the teen population in our country.  Many of you know, I listen to the Christian stations on the radio and tv.  I have been praying that our teen population will live a good, properous life without the use of drugs, illicit materials, etc.  I'm not asking those who don't agree with me to bash me for putting something on that deals with religion; I'm asking those who would like to live a good life the right way to do so and ask others to as well.
