I was pleasently surprised to find out that the service that I had to sing at today was only 30 minutes, but I still got paid 100. This has added to my happiness level. YES!      Anyway, it's been a while since I last typed something here. Just letting you all know I'm alive.  I know you're all disappointed, sorry ;^p.      Psyched for Florida!         Anyways, I've got to go. I'll talk to you all later.
