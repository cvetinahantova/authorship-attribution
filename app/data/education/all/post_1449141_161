What a great begining!  The forum was all that we dreamed it could be: thoughful, stimulating, engaging, and comapssionate.  Terry urged us to not only be "against" the Bush Administration's war plans, but be "for" true liberation for all.  That means we need to stand against those who would use religion or culture to enslave some (women, racial or religious minorities, gay/lesbian/transgendered)to benefit of the few.  Bringing troops home will not give anyone freedom.  We need not to demand that all live up to the ideals of free self determining human beings. Lets take back the term liberation and use it in its true deep sense and refuse to acknowledge perversions of the term to meet short term political ends.
