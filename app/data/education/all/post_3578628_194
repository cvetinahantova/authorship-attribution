The new way to make it look like you weren't ridiculous for allowing people to film you in a celebrity porn video just might be to donate all the money you make to charity.  Paris Hilton's decided in order to settle her sex-tape scandal with kinky costar Rick Salomon she'll give her share of the money  to charity.  She just wants to make the situation positive.  According to the New York Daily News, Hilton stands to earn about $400,000 plus a percentage of the sales from One Night in Paris, a 45-minute tribute to the platinum princess, who's shown having sex with Salomon and engaging in other more PG-rated activities. (Nothing with Paris is PG rated but anyways)  The big plus of donating money is that the two stars wouldn't have to sue each other for money anymore.    So getting down and dirty could be a new way to help support people.  Just grab a camera, do your stuff, and put it on the web.  Pick a charity like AIDS Foundation or American Heart Association maybe the Red Cross could use it.  Oh, and helps if people think you're incredibly sexy.  I think this sleazy shit is retarded.  Anyone can see this isn't about a hot porn video.  We're only hearing about it cause Paris is fighting with her costar *SLUT*
