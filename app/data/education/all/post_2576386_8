urlLink Batjay  suggested via the email that I create a blog about teaching as there are not too many around.  Hmmm, not a bad idea, so here goes.  It's now official.  I am once again part of the administration. No, I'm not looking forward to it as I still enjoy being with the students.  But the principal is my friend and he thinks he needs me to this post.  So, what am I supposed to do, eh?  So, the opening of this blog is just right.  No position, new blog.    Although the position is still that of a Coordinator, a position which I had for sometime until I resigned, this time the job entails handling discipline problems. (I never thought I was disciplined.  The principal has to do some heavy thinking, I guess)
