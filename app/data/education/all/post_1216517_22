WEATHER IN THE A.V.   Here's my 3rd article.    urlLink Desert 11, AVC 2   This story appeared in the Antelope Valley Press Saturday, April 5, 2003.  By DARREN HARBAUGH  Valley Press Staff Writer ------------------------------------------------------------------------ LANCASTER - The sophomores on the Antelope Valley College softball team played their last home game on Friday. Despite the cold and the rain, it was supposed to be a fond farewell.   College of the Desert had a different idea.  The Roadrunners dominated the Marauders, raining down 11 runs on nine base hits, for an 11-2 win cut to six innings due to the mercy rule.  This loss drops the Marauders to 8-3 in Foothill Conference action and 14-24 overall, while the win improves the first-place Roadrunners to 11-0 in conference and 32-2 overall.  AVC is still in second place in the Foothill, but their hopes of overtaking the first-place Roadrunners are all but dashed.   The Marauders need a second-place finish in the conference to earn a spot to the Southern California regional playoffs.   "We need to focus on what's ahead," AVC co-coach Becky MacQuarrie said. "We need to put this game behind us and stay on track. Right now our goal is second place to make it to regionals."  College of the Desert first baseman Vanessa Martinez led the Roadrunner attack with three doubles, driving in three runs. She shone defensively as well.   In the bottom of the fifth inning, she made an over-the-shoulder diving catch on a pop fly to shallow right field.  College of the Desert pitcher Vanessa Rodriguez, shut out the Marauders through five innings.   AVC scored two runs in the bottom of the sixth on a run-scoring single by Liz Brandt, but the comeback came too late. The Roadrunners had driven five runs across the plate in the top of the sixth. The game was ended by the mercy rule.  "We really expected better hitting and better fielding coming into this game," said AVC coach Becky MacQuarrie.  "You've got to give them credit," said AVC co-coach Cindy Vargas. "They've got a great pitcher. She has those kind of stats for a reason."

It was i the 30's.  I'm not joking.  Here's the forcast for AV:  urlLink Remainder of this afternoon and tonight:	Mostly clear. Breezy. lows in the 30s. West winds 20 to 30 mph  I couldn't feel my hands after sitting in the chilling rain for 2 hours with only a thin sweatshirt.  I could barely take notes when I interviewed the coachs because my hand couldn't grip the pen.  It sucked.  I couldn't feel my face either.  i've been spoiled by L.A weather, man.  Antelope Valley is incredibly windy too.  Nonstop.  I don't get it.
