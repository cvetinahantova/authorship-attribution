Large by Salvadoran standards, two story stucco apartment.   Cool tile floors, and my feet still stick to them.  My own bathroom, which I share with creeping bugs, whose little legs I can hear if I listen hard enough.  I make a concentrated effort not to listen too hard.    roommates, full of energy, spunk, desire to explore, and a general disdain for all things that creep and crawl.  Entertaining at times.  I let the moth flutter about the room, my sticky arms, our drying clothes, and Jamie swats the air with a rubber flip-flop.  Yes, yes, I think I will love living with these girls, in this place that will be our home come hell or high water!    Wealthy foreigners in the wealthy part of town.  A view of the city, the hustle bustle, and a volcano across the valley.  I´ll climb it eventually, but with the company of the armed tourist police, whose job it is to protect hikers, campers, travelers.  Get used to never being alone, not even to stroll in the evenings, hike in the woods, or shop downtown?  Could you do it?  Do you think I could?  If you know me, you know I will, and I´ll love it because this is what I choose.  I´ll cherish my alone time, and embrace the togetherness I´m surrounded with.
