forgot about this til just now... anonymous quote:  "the way you serve your personality is like a bad egg souffle... like say you make a souffle but goof up and put in waaay too much onion, and you know it, so you add lots of salt and stuff to make it better... then the darn thing tastes good, and you have a good personality... but instead of just starting over and trying to do it with less onion you just work with that's there... it's a bad souffle man."... (in this really weird analogy apparently onions are being worried and paranoid and salt is being humorous... go figure)... at any rate, i have omelet on the mind now... wonder where i could get a good one (i don't feel like buying a carton of eggs for one decent omelet)  the end.  gave up on homework, i'm going to sleep.
