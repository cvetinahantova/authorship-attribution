urlLink Welcome to Mailblocks. The Mailblocks email service blocks spam email from your inbox and up to three other email accounts you choose   I sent an e-mail today to somene who I have never sent an e-mail to.  I received an e-mail back from this service asking me to use their authentication process to PROVE I was a human and not some e-mail script sending out spam.  They provide a FREE service and their BASIC service seems reasonably priced.   Only 9.95 per year to KEEP spam out of your inbox.  Divide the number of spam emails you get by 10.00 and see how much you are paying to STOP spam.  Anyway, you get the point...  LOL...
