I now find myself in the city of Dalat.  I just arrived today and it's an awesome city with a lot of character.  It has a very Europeon feel to it.  I went to the beach yesterday in Mui Ne.  Fun but nothing really special.  They have some amazing sand dunes that I went and saw.  I again rented a bike and zipped around during the after noon and then played around in the South China Sea.   It looked like it was going to rain so I dipped into this here internet cafe but of course it didn't.  It started a little bit and I figured it wise to get out of the street.  Anywah I need to check my mail and stuff.  I'm not sure how long I'll stay here or what I'll do exactly tomorrow.  There seems to be a far bit as far as tours and whatnot go so I'll figure something out.   There seems to be so much to do in Vietnam.  At first time was dragging ass in Cambodia but it's really picked up ever since I was in HCMC and it's showing not signs of slowing down.  I have at least 2 more weeks left in Vietnam and then I'll go to Laos.  I think I might try and fly there if I can find a good deal.  I'm a little worried about running out of time.  There is still tons more I want to do.  Namely I really want to make it to Myanmar.  I'll need to fly in and out which shouldn't be a big deal.  But b/c of visa issues I'll have to wait until I get back to Thailand to fly.   Ok I haven't put up some quizzes in a long time so here goes.
