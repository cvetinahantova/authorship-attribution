Hav came round last night and we ate lasagne and Lindt chocolate bunny and quaffed pink champagne. How incredibly decadent!   Got up this morning and winged my way down the East London line to my new school. It took about half an hour.  Half an hour!  Am going to gain just  hours  of my life back this term through not having to make ridiculous odyssey-esque voyages to work every day. This is amazing. I can play an extra hour of Gamecube every night! (I wanted to say extra planning, extra marking, extra resource-building, but who am I kidding?)  The school is called Haberdasher's Askes. That's cos it was founded by the Guild of Haberdashers way back in ner-ner-nerfty-ner, and some guy called Aske donated a wad of cash to them when he died. It's massive and split over two sites, and it has more resources than you can shake a meter ruler at. They have darkrooms, they have kiln rooms, they have screen-printy things and a minibus service. You can charge your lunch to the school on a little swipey-card, and the same card will also do your photocopying for you! Genius! And they gave me keys! I keep using exclamation marks ALL THE TIME!!! It's a whole new world, people. I just hope I can remember how to teach so they won't kick me out.   In a miraculous development, Barbara has put the Assessment essay deadline back to the 1st of June. Honestly, today couldn't really get any better!   Will probably get run over by a car on the way to the pub.
