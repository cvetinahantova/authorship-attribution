Dear Congressman,  I receiveed today's Washington update where you call for an "END TO THE POLICIES HURTING ECONOMIC GROWTH."  In the message you call for an end to tax the tax cuts that our Govenor has already stolen from us. Why don't you call for a reduction in goverment spending and waste instead of taking more money from MY pockets.  Remember, it is MY money, that I worked hard to earn, that you are spending.  All the government has done has take it from me in taxes.  Sincerely, Marc J. Fleischner Berlin, NJ.
