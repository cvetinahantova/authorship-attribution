................................ discursively formed ................................  i've been away for the weekend with a group of students who i love.  no really, *love*.  it was a really great group.  a really rewarding time...  it was the sort of group that was constituted mostly of external - processers...so the experience was thick with commentary, punchline, idiom, and in-jokes.  by the end of the weekend Ann mentioned the sort of incipient disappointment at seeing it end.  Kristy took notes on it and ended up charting an entire universe of discourse.  after these sorts of time-out-of-time experiences -- everyone who participates comes away with a keen sense that there's a world we've created together.  and even though we'll temporally never be able to return to it -- its a world that will always inform our future worlds.  but then i came back this morning and checked my blogroll and found out that i (or at least the character i play on this blog) was popping up on several blogs.  And it felt great.  So. Thanks for making me real marcaus, kelly, trena, & bemis (albeit ambivalently so...).  oh yeah, and commenters too.  Russ, Ryan, Kleman, Skylark, Marcaus, Gary, my brothers....   i'll be thinking of y'all today...  peace~
