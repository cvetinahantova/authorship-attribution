Round and round she goes indeed...          I am The Wheel of Fortune    The Wheel of Fortune represents unexpected encounters and twists of fate. You can't predict surprises; you can only be aware when one is circling around. Indeed, Card 10 often suggests wheel-like actions - changes in direction, repeating cycles and rapid movement. When the energy of the Wheel arrives, you will feel life speed up. You are caught in a cyclone that may deposit you anywhere. "Round and round and round she goes, and where she stops, nobody knows."

Month:   Day:   Year:          That was a jolly surprise.  Not!  Well, maybe. A bit. We did the nose. And the hat.  The weekend was... Eventful. Really interesting things happened. Some of them, well, I would have liked to go differently. But it could have gone worse. And to that special someone, if you're reading this, I'm not mad at you. Not a single bit. You did what you felt was right, and I fully understand your position. So don't go on getting depressed about it or anything, because I  will  find out. And do something about it. Something nice, that'll cheer you up.  Sunday I went back to Waterloo (oh yeah, I didn't tell you that I was spending it with my parents in Kingston, did I?). I went to see one of the places renting rooms, and the landlady had told me that if I liked it I could move in immediately. It turned out to be not exactly as nice as the one I'd seen before, but it was available immediately, and it was cheaper. So I said "what the hell, it's only 4 months" and took it. So now I got a new address! Yay for me. I pretty much went to sleep right after moving in.  Today was eventful too, in a different kind of way. I started the day with "Social Implications of Computers", a very interesting class. Definitively a keeper. Then there was a run to the bank to start my account. Which I did. Yay. Then back to school. Get the key to my office. Get my computer account. Find out that it's not working. The account, not the computer. Have to go activate it. Then to class - Algorithms. Darn boring too, but I had brought books, so no harm done. Then... Well, since I had no computer and needed to write my paper due for tomorrow, I decided to drive back to Kingston (yeah, I'm crazy, so what?). At least now I'm going to be taking the laptop with me, and tomorrow I'm getting a wireless card, and hopefully then I'll have internet access. No printer yet, but something is something. Now... Well, I think a nap is in order, then I'll hopefully get up in time to talk to some folk online, then off to Waterloo again. It'll be another long day I'm afraid.
