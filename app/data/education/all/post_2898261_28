Listening to: students' complaining Mood:      So I've finally got a few minutes to spare... but as usual it's only a few.  Spoke to D today. I can't even imagine what he's going through. His child's life is on the line because of a very sick woman, namely the child's mother.  He's blaming himself, which I guess is understandable, but fruitless and unfounded. I didn't know quite what to say to him because I don't particularly believe there's any words that could be said to ease any of his suffering, so I just remained quiet and said pretty much nothing.  Additionally, I was offered a wonderful job today E1500 per month, accomodation paid for, during the summer months... in Spain. I've already turned it down, for obvious reasons. I think G was a bit upset/surprised at that, but life goes on... It's just not something I can do and that's the end of that.  Lately I've been contemplating my future and how I would like it to turn out and I've come to the conclusion that life isn't as stable as I thought it was because I can't for the life of me see what I want to happen, happening.    This is a turn for the books, someone who had life planned out to the max now without a plan... Unfortunately, I'm not OK with not having a plan. I don't like it one bit, in fact I feel very much lost and disorientated without one, however 'loose' it may be...  And now the few minutes to spare that I had are over...  HASTA
