"Badly done, Emma.  Badly done indeed."  If you don't know where that came from, you don't deserve to know ;)  I watched almost the entire movie on Monday, and had to leave, right before the end.   Why do I always want chocolate chip cookies for breakfast?  For that matter, why hasn't Jenn's baby come yet?  Poor Jenn.  Come out, come out, wherever you are...olly, olly, all's in free...open Sesame!!??!?   Ali Baba had dem forty thieves; Scherezadie had dem thousand tales ...  Yay for free association.
