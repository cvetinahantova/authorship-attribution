I'm feeling not so paranoid today!   That wasn't the case earlier, but as the night wears on, I've been feeling better and more relaxed.  Perhaps it's the realization that I leave tomorrow for  a mini vacation at a cabin up north.  My mind works in weird yet wonderous ways... I got to thinking and I got to thinking after typing that last sentence,  what is "up north"?  For someone in Florida heading up north for a vacation that could be just about anywhere.  What about someone in Canada?  How far up north could you go?  To me, up north is almost akin to a utopia - a place where everyone exisit in peace in seemingly perfect conditions.  It's the ideal vacation spot where you will find relaxation and contentment.  When things are troubling you, head "up north".  Though so perfect in all it's makeup, up north also seems almost unreachable and unattainable as well - like a carrot dangled before your eyes.  Up north is El Dorado - it's the Fountain of Youth.    Well, regardless of what it is, my daughter and I are heading there this weekend - at least we are going to attempt to find it!  Sitting at our campfire with a trillion stars glistening overhead, no phones or computers in sight, I think we'll come darn close.
