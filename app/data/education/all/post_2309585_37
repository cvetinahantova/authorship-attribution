urlLink     urlLink Which Evil Villain Bad Habit are you?    I've come up with a plan. It came to me all of a sudden while I was trying to walk to the Reynolds Center. See, it was during class time, when people don't usually stop to let you cross the street. Well, someone actually did, so I waved at them. And it felt good that somebody actually acknowledged my existence for a couple of seconds to let me cross the street. And it made me feel nice. So, I smiled about it for a full five or ten minutes.  And so, my plan: acknowledge someone's existence for only a few seconds a day. Even if they're a total stranger. It'll make them feel good for a while, so they'll do the same thing for someone else. Eventually, we'll all get to noticing people around us and feeling good.  There you have it. My plan for world domination. Or something like that.  BTW, I just watched the finals for the county spelling bee. The winning word was "rhubarb."
