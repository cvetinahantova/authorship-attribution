R is for Rawk   I promised what little publicity I can provide to my friend Alyse who, along with the rest of her band  urlLink The   urlLink Winks , will be playing SXSW next week.  Go see them; buy their record; tell all your friends.  They are the toast of the town.    Alyse was almost in my old band but she was too shy to play the drums in front of us.  For this reason, I always assumed she just sucked, but I guess I was wrong.  Not only is Alyse my first friend to play SXSW, she is the first friend I have whose  urlLink masturbatability has been commented upon in a published forum .  But, you know, he liked the music too. Please join me in wishing The Winks success at the showcase.   In other news, it's Tuesday, so I'll be gone all day.  This would be a great time to unveil my drawing of a singing slice of bread, but I'm having trouble with my image host.  Sorry.
