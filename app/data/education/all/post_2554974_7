----------------------------------------   New Years Eve!   --------------------- I was frankly disspointed wif e east view unit, not onli wad e attendence attrocious, e attitude of e cadets was like shit! Damn.. it was a waste of my tyme. Den went 2 Yasir's house 2 get ready, he took like 15mins 2 wear e damn contacts! In e end we juz left dem!   We den met up wif e rest for e guys, haha.. smuggled KFC food into e cinema as usual! SCHOOL OF ROCK WAS AWESOME MAN!! I really love e bassist of e band, Katie - Rebecca Browns. She's damn cute for an 11yr old girl. The movie was full of kewl jams! The story line was quite interesting. I cud see dat Andi was interested in Yasir as she wanted him 2 sit next 2 her. I had 2 change seats wif Yasir.  Well.. den we met up wif Shariffah and went 2 my sis's b'dae pit. Fai and hamizah n andi left early..party poopers... Den e rest of us hanged out at e jetty. We watched e sunset while tryin 2 tune e guitar for my sis. Enjoyed e cool breeze while attempting 2 dive into e sea! ahha.. well.. den mas was thrown into e sea.. she was interrupted off her meal of chicken wings. Den we left n took a walk wif tubby.. again! haha.. yasir, alfiyan n izzat was scared stiff! aha.. i passed dat phase already!! it was kinda fun.. disturbing n scaring... Den we went home coz it getting late.   Now talking 2 Miss Sherriff... she's forcing me 2 blog! coz she loves 2 read... read read read.. ok.. i guess i'll stop... Happy New Year!! Yeah! HANG LOOSE!
