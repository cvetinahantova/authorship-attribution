Despite it's name  urlLink Jockey Slut  is one of the Best music magazines around.  I like its attitude a lot more than some of the other Dance Glossies and shows that them music is still much more than hedonism, drugs and semi nudity (unlike some "dance" magazines) it also does a wicked CD series that rounds up the best in alternative dance and electronica and is alsways full of gems.  This month's magazine has a retrospective on the Chemical Brothers and a feature on Banksy.
