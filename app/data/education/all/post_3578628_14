I dunno but I was thinkin...movies (or documentaries) probably make more money because of the controversy they create.  Like..if a movie has a lot of buzz going around with it, it'll probly do better than a movie that doesn't.  But just because it makes a lot of money, doesn't necessarily make it good.  It might just make a lot of money because of how controversial it is - not because it's any good.  Just a random thought.
