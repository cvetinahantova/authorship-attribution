Everyday---day in and day out we have to figure out what gives excitement and what breaks the routinary things we do, to make always a day as if it is another-- different, special and wonderful day!  Yesterday was a great time spent with Jorge (Sta Lucia and Lola Helen), another day of "kakulitan" at paglalambing. Kaya nga ngayon pa lang na-mimis ko na siya. Mami-mis ko talaga siyaÂ kaya lang ganyan talaga and buhay. But at least we have started building great memories to ponder on and laugh at when we are far away from each other, when we are lonely and so alone...  Today I have to study for my exam on Monday and Tuesday but I started my day washing my clothes though ang logging in my blog to at least write things that are coming in my mind. I plan to go to UP and get my stuffs there in the binding center. Then I have to discipline myself now, to really sit and start studying or else I'll be doomed!   And suddenly I just remember this song:   "How did you know I needed SOMEONE like you in my life.  That there's an empty space in my heart.  You came at the right time in my life. I'll never forget  how you brought up the sun to shine in my life  and took all the worries and fears that I have.  I guess what I am really trying to say; it's not everyday that  SOMEONE like you comes my way.  No words can express how much "I LOVE YOU"   It's a meaningful song, and i linger on it!   I thank God.   JO
