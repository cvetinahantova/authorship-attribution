urlLink    So here we have the most beautiful little girl in the world.  This is my best friend's daughter, whom shall remain nameless at this time as I'm not entirely comfortable putting out personal information about other people.  I snapped this on June 5th after working with her on the whole "Say cheese" thing.  It's times like these that I wish I had one or two of my own, so I could stop doting on other people's kids.  Maybe I'll just wait until she turns 13.Â  urlLink      What I meant by waiting until she's 13 is that every 13 year-old girl becomes significantly more unbearable than they were when they were 12.  It's a scientific fact that exists amongst all women.  From the ages of 13-20, all women go through temporary periods of insanity.
