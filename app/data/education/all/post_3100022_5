Wow what an awesome place, it so strange to see a city with no cars, trucks, bikes etc everything is water based like the  (overpriced) gondollas. The church was about as good as the many I have seen all around europe, but the city itself was the most impressive thing. If you should plan to go to venice, I would recommend it, but bear in mind that there is really only enough there to keep you interested for mno more than two days.  Did you know that the entirety of venice is built on top of underwater foundations. There is a lot of history here two, I have been finding out along the way, about how much the nations of europe are intertwined.   Our tour guide is fantastic too, he is really good at giving just the right amount of information along with cutting out  all of the crap, for instance, we went on a guided tour through the streets of florence, with a local guide (because over here it is illegal to be a guide unless you have a permit, and are a local based business) who was crap because she keeped on telling us about how many bricks it took to build a certain church, and how many steps there were to the top, rather than any of the important information about the history of the place.
