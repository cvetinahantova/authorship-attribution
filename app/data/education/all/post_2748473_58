Shit        Old friend, I hear you I know just how you feel I've been in your shoes before  I've seen your worries, And I can understand everything you going through  And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight My friend, I've listened Things only can improve You have all the time in the world So keep on fighting, And never let them say there's anything that you can't do Cause I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight  I watched as you sat with a cigarette in your hand, holding a drink in the other, Trying to drown all your pain: And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight Old friend, you'll realize, Good things are worth the wait Enjoy the times that you have You'll see a new day, When darkness fades again, And the sun can rise to shine And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight.       I am such a lazy piece and don't ever post anymore because you guys never get online to talk to me and it makes me very sad. Not really. I'm such a dookie head.
