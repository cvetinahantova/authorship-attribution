Oh gosh we have to rush to the LTO to follow-up tina's stuffs. Well today is another busy day for us, at least last night I was able to sleep well because my cough took pity on me...but I woke up at around 4:00 Am just to go to John's place (call of nature) and was able to sleep again. But I have to re-visit my doctor then after go to the LTO office with Kuya Joseph. A lot of people were saying I am getting thinner each day because perhaps of lack of sleep and lovesick...ha ha ha, FOOL!   I really have to sit down now and discipline myself to review...my comprehensive exam will be on September.   Nothing's new today except that I am still waiting for Jorge's call.   Jo
