Well, I had an incredibly interesting trip to the cities this weekend.  Odd things abounded.  First of all, I visited my old high school (Eagan), because my brother was coaching a speech tournament.  I ran into an old teacher who recognized me, and we talked for a bit.  I decided to walk around the school, and realized that all the classrooms were unlocked.  After visiting a few classrooms, I walked into a special one; the class in which I took accelerated math for two years, and got my ass kicked constantly.  At the time, I was a student who was never meeting expectations and so forth, and, acting like an 18 year old, I blamed the teacher and so forth.  Sitting in the chair, I knew I was a different person.  Where before I felt weak and the prey of mathematics, I now sat in the chair as a master of that realm.  My old spirit still dwelled in that chair, but it cowered in the presence of my current self.    Saw some speeches, met my brother's mentor and friends, then left.  Next thing was the Iranian party itself.  Very well done; good food, good music, good people.  I met this family whose mother was Iranian, and father was Cameroonian (Cameroon is in West Central Africa, between Nigeria and Congo).  There were three children, one woman, age 25, and two sons.  The oldest son graduated in Eagan '97, which is the same year as myself, although we didn't recognize each other at all.  He was only there for 1 year, and it is a very large school (over 2000 students when we were there).  When he left, he gave me his card so we could hang out next time I'm in town.  Onto his sister, May.  We talked for a while, and she was very cool, and beautiful; the half-persian, half-african blend can be an amazing thing with the right genes.  She works at the math department at St. Thomas in St. Paul.  She grew up in Cameroon until the age of sixteen, and went to school in Mankato.  She also loves "The Lord of the Rings," having read all the books a couple of times, and the movies a few times.  I plan on keeping in contact with her.        I went to bed on Saturday night, thinking that I had a satisfactory weekend.  How little did I know that it was not quite over.   I flew back to Bemidji Sunday morning.  At the airport, I ran into Tommi, my ex-fiancee.  We haven't seen each other or spoken to one another since November.  The last conversation had been very cold.  As I was getting into my Jeep, I saw her at her car, which was about fifty feet from where I was standing.  She had been dropping her mom off at the airport.  As she opened the door, I just looked for a moment, not knowing what to do.  She hadn't seen me yet, but I thought, "what the hell?"  "Hey!" I said, and she looked at me, noticeably surprised, and after a moment, said "hey." We stared at each other, unsure of what to do for a solid fifteen seconds.  Then I walked over to her.  The meeting was very warm.  We talked for a few minutes; she seems to be happy with her life right now.  We didn't have much to say, and she was late for work.  This entry has gotten quite long, but I have one more thing to say.  I know I have been angry with Tommi on occasion over the last few months, and have said and thought some pretty harsh stuff about her.  Well, I would like to take it all back.  I know that I can't, of course, but it is not how I really feel about her; I would like to keep her in my memory as I saw her today.  Despite our problems, I did love her because I find her to be an amazing person, and I suppose I do still love her to some extent.  Yes, she did hurt me, but I was the one who hurt her first by ending the engagement.  But don't read into this too much; I have no intention of starting the relationship again, or even contacting her.
