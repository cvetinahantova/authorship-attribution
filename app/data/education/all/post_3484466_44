Well, we played another game of StarCraft... Nate and I kicked ass the first game, and then Nate and Matt teamed and Kyle and I got our asses kicked. I kinda got in that lazy/bored mood and built a ton of cannons and nothing else, so the rest of the time was spent watching them pick their way through.  Anywho, I'm really bored, now, so I'll be back later.  Current Music: Elton John - Your Song
