..as Siobhan likes to call him. He is now 2 months old. He went to the Dr. today, he weighs 13 pounds and 5 oz. He is 24.5 inches long. The Dr. was quite surprised when I told her he was sleeping 5.5 to 7 hours at a time, eating and then heading back for at least another 3-5 hours. My kids like to sleep! He is as cute as can be, cooing at everything. Smiling when he sees something he likes, and we have even heard a laugh or two. Of course, three shots later, he is snoozing away. What a little joy that boy is!
