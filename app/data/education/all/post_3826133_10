Kins and I talked during lunch.  I think we're both going to run away to Seattle.  It will be fun, and I can get my daily dose of KEXP.  On the radio, not the computer.  Even Karen today is doing nothing.  I don't feel so bad (now) that I've spent all day playing games....again.  It's either 1404, 1406, 1359, or straight up 1400 by the four clocks sitting on or around my desk.  No wonder I can't make it to work on time.  Which I did this morning, partial help going to Mr. Monkeypants as he called me incessantly this morning making certain I wasn't still asleep.  (Thanks, Sam.)  No luck on the publishing as yet.  Will keep you posted.  Literally, I suppose, as that's what I do on this site.
