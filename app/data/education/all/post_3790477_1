in the illusionary infinite regress how do we express ourselves the faceless face of time make our faces melt and rhyme because a breathing out and in suriving only animal realities of sexual sin beyond there is no doubt nor faith but only personalities which bubble up and out from within an edge no straight nor spherical no rational nor removable i wonder where we will go when there is no roads to show no path to know  what i'm wondering about is in unconscience universe there is no difference for me and no peference to be morality is crazy and logic is insane and the potrait that is made is all there is to fake then how does this jive with the way that i live and how does this jive with the way that i die and if the story self made then how do i surive  no faith no individuals, no community no beauty, no reality, just pretended personalitie? faith a oddity on the curvatur of that bubble, making it easier to pop, the short lived, forgotten rott in the ground and the worms will dine tonight with a smile and delight
