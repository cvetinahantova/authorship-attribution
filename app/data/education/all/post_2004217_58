I feel strangely calm today. Perhaps it's because I'm at my dad's house. Stop looking confused, I know what you're thinking: that I hate it there; I feel trapped, marooned, distanced from my own little world. But ever since I started work at Marks & Sparks and going to dad's house involved me arriving, eating, sleeping and leaving in the space of 24 hours, I've felt restless; I think it's because, as much as I don't like it, coming to Worcester and seeing my dad has become a part of me, and (I think) it's important for me to get that experience of father-daughter interaction. Or perhaps I'm content because I've found someone to go to Drive Thru with me :o) Love you Sean! Debbs is gonna come see Hundred Reasons with me as well, so all I need to find now is a gig partner for Mest and Less Than Jake... anyone?  Ceff x   'Cos this life is too short to live it just for you, but when you feel so powerless, what are you gonna do?
