What is it about  urlLink Froot Loops  that make them taste so good?  Is it the five pounds of sugar, the various color additives, perhaps just the round, donut like shape?  Perhaps the allure is that of Toucan Sam.  Who doesn't like a talking bird telling you to eat his cereal.  I think I know.  It was the fact that I was deprived of this particular cereal as a child and now, cannot get enough of them.  Yep, that must be it.  That or they use crack/cocaine in lieu of sugar.
