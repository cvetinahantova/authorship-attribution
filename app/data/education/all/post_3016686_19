From the NY Daily News:   Somewhere over Massachusetts is a sparrow who apparently doesn't care for '80s rock.  Cyndi Lauper was reaching for a high note during her opening number at Saturday's KISS-108-sponsored concert in Mansfield, Mass., when from the sky came a white glob of bird poop.  The fecal critique landed in her open mouth.  Showing more aplomb than Tippi Hedren ever displayed in "The Birds," the Brooklyn-born rocker wiped her tongue on her sleeve and kept on rockin'.   The 50-year-old singer did kvetch backstage that a bird once plopped on her head while she was on stage.   "My grandmother says it's good luck, but I think it's disgusting," she moaned.   Maybe birds just want to have fun.
