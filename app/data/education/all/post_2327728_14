Ok, I now intend to "practice" my PSST note for the Coast.  I am sending it later today, so it probably won't show up for a week or so.  D'oh!  I think that is too late... it's too close to the holidays - what if he isn't from here?  Anyway, possible notes are:  "Jake @ FLB - I think you are ridiculously attractive.  Are you single?  I wish I could get my head out of the sand, cuz I think we'd make a good team.  Just come up to me and say hello!"  Very Weezer-esque...maybe too much so.  "Jake @ FLB - I haven't had a crush like this since high school.  You make me nervous and weird, and I want to give you my number, but I can't seem to get the words out.  I don't want to buy anymore candy, but I don't know how else to see you."  Too childish?  I think it's sincere, but I am not sure if people would understand where I am coming from.  "Jake @ FLB - Did we make serious eye-contact, or was that just wishful thinking?  Maybe so, but you should know I think you are attractive, and if I had the chance to get to know you, it would be amazing.  How much candy do I need to buy to get your attention?"  Ok, last one.  This time, how about a feel-good message?  This is what I would like to get from someone.  "Jake @ FLB - there is something about you and it makes me want to know you. I want to ask you out, and if I knew you were single, I would do it.  For now, I will admire you in secret, and keep coming back for boysenberries."  There we go.  That's the one.
