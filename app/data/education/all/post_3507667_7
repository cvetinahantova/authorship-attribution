Well this is one of those days that I'm just exhausted. The girls were up at 6am, and I didn't get much sleep the night before. Ran around all day doing laundry and cleaning, then got the bright idea to do some baking, so I made brownies.   The girls must have found some speed pills lying about, because they were going nuts all day, nonstop, until they went to a birthday party for a neighbour that I totally forgot about and had to race down to the mall and pick up presents and a card.    My loving dog, decided she didn't like the fact that I left with out here and chewed up the loveseat, down to the wood.  So she's, excuse the pun, in the dog house. No treats for her today.  The girls are in the bath now, and then shortly to bed, so to give myself a bit of a break, I've decided to vent here on my blog.  All you parents out there no what type of day I'm talking about, we all have them.  Single parents of course are doubley exposed to the strees.  What I need is one of those coin dispensers of Valium and Ativan...ohhh yeah!!  RLB   A Moments Peace should last more than a Moments Peace!
