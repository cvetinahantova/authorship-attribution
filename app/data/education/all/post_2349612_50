Dorothy moves to click her ruby shoes Right in tune with dark side of the moon   Someone, someone could tell me Where I belong  Be calm, be brave, it'll be okay   No more messing around and living underground And new year's resolutions By this time next year I won't be here I turn on MTV, the volume's down Lips move, they say It'll be okay  To tell you the truth, I've said it before Tomorrow I start in a new direction One last time these words from me I'm never saying them again and I shut the light and listen as my watch unwinds  Voices calling from a yellow road To come downstairs and say hello Don't be shy, just say hello  To tell you the truth, I've said it before Tomorrow I start in a new direction I know I've been half-asleep I'm never doing that again  I look straight at what's coming ahead and soon its going to change in a new direction Every night as I'm falling asleep These words repeated in my head...
