I have a new respect for those people who work a 8-5 job, I started working this week and I have to be in by 7:30ish, it's so hard for me! Like I am still getting six to eight hours of sleep but I am used to 10-12. I am pathetic I know but my body isn't used to the lack of sleep. Luckily though before the boys wake up I get about an hour nap, it's funny because their parent's leave for work and I just go sit on the couch with the dog and we take a nap till the boys wake up. It helps.   Derek and Trevor are some pretty neat boys, we play lots of games let me tell you. I didn't think that Scrabble would be a popular game with boys who are 10 and 12 but we've played it a lot lately. We decided to make homemade pudding yesterday it looked disgusting but it tasted great. The boys also learned how to make a sandwich, I couldn't believe that they didn't know how. Their dad was so proud when they told him later.   I guess if you can please pray that I get the rest I need even if it means making myself go to bed earlier and that I will have enough energy to keep up with the boys. Thanks!
