Dear Kobe,  I've been listening to you talk for weeks now about how you want a team that you can call "your team."  I'm not really a big fan of yours, but I'm gonna help you anyway, give you a little advice.  You cannot make a team yours by simply saying that it is.  You may be able to get ownership to make you the priority.  You may get them to hire a coach you like, bring in players you like, and get rid of players you don't like.  Still doesn't make it your team.  You may be the most talented player on the court, but that doesn't make it your team either.  It might surprise you to learn that the heart of the team is often not the guy with the most ability.  You can stand up in front of everyone on your team and tell them, "Listen up, guys.  This is my team."  You know what?  It still doesn't make it your team.  In fact, if you have to point it out to everyone, it's probably NOT your team.  The only way to make it your team is to earn it because those other four guys on the court with you?  They don't care if Jerry Buss likes you the best.  Oh, here's a hint.  Refusing to shoot for two quarters because you don't like teammates criticizing you doesn't earn you jack squat.  Either grow up and earn your own team or shut up.  Sincerely, Heather   P.S.  Don't go to Denver.  If you think 'Melo is going to put up with your "I'm the man," crap, you're in for a rude awakening.  Dear Shaq,  It's bad enough that you refer to yourself in the third person.  To refer to yourself in the third person AND use a nickname while doing it is inexcusable.  Please stop calling yourself  The Diesel.  Sincerely, Heather
