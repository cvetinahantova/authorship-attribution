The first two performances of AMerican Idol tonight.  I was doing something I never, ever do.  I went to the grocery store alone.  TOtally and completely alone.  Do you know how often I am  that  alone?  Never.    It was nice.  I did see the final performances, honestly I think both girls had a bad case of nerves.  I don't know who will win.  Part of me thinks fantasia will, the other thinks diana will.  I don't even know who I would vote for.  That is why I didn't vote.    I guess we will see tomorow night.
