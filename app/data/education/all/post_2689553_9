Tonight is the last concert of the season.  And we have 74 days till band camp.  Its gonna be a looong road....i'm gonna go through so much band withdrawal it won't be funny.  Anyway, I guess i SHOULD talk about something not related to band.  Lets see...well, I'm going to the prom with Kristine Smith.  I got her corsage today.  I don't really know her that well, my friend Brenna set us up.  I called her last night, and we talked for like a half-hour. She's a really nice girl, I'll probably call her again tonight after the concert.  Finals are over, so theres a good thing.  Not much else...
