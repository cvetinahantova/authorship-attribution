urlLink     On Tuesday we got to go to the Sistine Chapel. It was a pretty cool to see the famous ceiling first hand. At the centre of it is an image that has been seen, copied and sent up so many times before. Nevertheless, the picture retains its power. It is the central point of our story; God reaching out to man. Like our lives the centre of Rome was very busy. Many things clamoured for our attention, ancient sites, cafes, shops, people but in the middle of it God reaches out and touches us. The challange to us there was this, do we allow ourselves time to see God reaching, do we respond? Or do we just get distracted by the noise and the sites. I guess that's a challenge we share here too.
