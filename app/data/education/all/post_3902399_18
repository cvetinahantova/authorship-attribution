So many times we take the national or local news to be the truth.  We don't see the news on the same level as other television programs or talk shows.  But what we tend to forget is that news programs are in the entertainment buisness.  Many conservatives accuse most national news media as being liberally biased.  At the same time, liberals complain about the majority of talk radio shows being mostly conservative.  Do you think that national and local news shows ever bend the truth or omit parts of a story in order to favor a particular political party or also to increase the entertainment value of the story?  Do you think this is right?  Should news outlets be required to stick strictly to the facts, or should they be allowed to present the stories the way they choose because they are just anonther television program trying to get ratings?
