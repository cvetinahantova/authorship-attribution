Well, in about five minutes I'm going to be heading out to North Carolina for the week, so I'm not going to be able to update the blog or check my email.  I'll be shooting down through Virginia and visiting Greenville, SC and maybe even Atlanta, GA.  When I get back though I'll be sure to you fill you all in...  urlLink leave me some email love !
