While I was writing the last post our elderly next door neighbour appeared at the door distraughtly.  Her water pipe had come off the wall and was leaking on the floor.  I know nothing about plumbing but thought it would be better to do something than nothing so got buckets and newspapers and tried to reassure.  I felt extremely useless and unhelpful really particularly as she would not let us take round food or tea or anything.  God please look after her.
