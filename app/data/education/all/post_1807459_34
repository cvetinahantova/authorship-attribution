The birthday is tomorrow but I'm not too pumped up.  I had a really rocking birthday last year so I don't feel the need for one this year.  But think it will still be pretty wild seeing as how it is a joint party with Caleb and he is inviting a lot of people.  I don't know why I feel this way but I just do.  Maybe it is b/c I'm turning 25.  I guess I can rent a car now.  But really, where does the time go?  Who knows.   In good news for me I've gotten off my ass and decided to do something about being single.  I have a date for Tuesday night.  We'll see how that goes.  She is pretty and speaks English so that is at least a start.  If I never write about this again you'll know it went to hell.   I have been swapping English for Korean lessons at work with one of the teachers.  So far I'm very pleased.  It is good to have someone to motivate you.   I've been drinking a lot lately it seems.  These two consecutive days of sobriety are doing me some good.  But that should come to an end oh, say tomorrow night.   I have been told my message board is still out of control.  I think I'll delete it one of these days.   I am hoping tomorrow will be fun.  For anyone who doesn't know we are meeting at WABA at 10.   I'm tired and don't feel like writing more.  Where do they fucking sell bed sheets in Korea?
