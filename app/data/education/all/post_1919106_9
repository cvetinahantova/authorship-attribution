Gaming   Last night's game was ok. I mean, I had a lot of fun towards the middle/end of the game, when I pretty much saved the party (one of my magic missiles got extended duration, so we ended up tossing it around at the group of skeletons that was attacking us), then almost got them killed (my detect magic spell exploded), then saved them again twice (ended up using oils to set the party's weapons on fire to kill a gelatinous cube, and then made a successful knowledge check to realize that a wererat can only be hurt by silver and magical weapons [ I  knew that, but  my character  didn't]). They also turned me into the party's guinea pig, and made me test potions and powders, so now my tongue is magical, I tasted a potion of invisibility and a powder that we don't know what it is (but I got a pretty good idea >:] ) and we don't know what effect it caused (can't be worse than the effect of my character snorting the stuff though - yes, he  snorted  some unknown powder) so it'd be interesting to find out what it is.  Now to the bad stuff: I don't think this person realizes it, but some comments made by a-certain-person-who-I-don't-want-to-name-but-we-all-know-who-it-is would be considered offensive by certain friends of mine. I personally don't mind because I know them not to be true, and I believe them to be said in jest, but I know that other people don't have nearly as much patience as I have, and even mine was drawing thin there... but then again, I'd rather forget and forgive than hold a grudge for something silly. The game has also been drawing out for too long. I think that soon I won't be willing to play anymore because it's too much of a tax on my health and my sanity [random CoC reference] roll for sanity... botches! [/random CoC reference] and I'd like to spend my time on other things apart from gaming, like my friends and my projects.
