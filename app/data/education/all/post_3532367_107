I wanted to go for a cycle tonight, but after having got the kids to bed and got myself ready, Sandra made stupid comments. They were along the lines of "I'll have to get into this depression lark so that I can pop out for an hour to relax". That made me feel worse. I didn't go in the end because of it, and although she apologised, the damage had already been done.  I tried to make up for my lack of exercise by taking the dogs at 22:00 and having a run round the park. I got all sweaty for 5 minutes, but my legs and shins suffered on the uneven ground.
