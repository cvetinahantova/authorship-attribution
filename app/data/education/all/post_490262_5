Thought I'd give this  urlLink Friday Five  thing a try:   1. What was the first thing you ever cooked?  French toast.  It's still my favorite dinner-for-breakfast food.   2. What's your signature dish?  Lasagne for my husband.  For everyone else it's this Taco Soup recipe I stole from my friend Margaret.   3. Ever had a cooking disaster? (tasted like crap, didn't work, etc.) Describe . The first time I made fried chicken it was beautiful, golden, crispy brown on the outside and raw on the inside...   4. If skill and money were no object, what would make for your dream meal?  Tortellini in this amazing tomato cream sauce that a local italian restaurant ( urlLink Mama Stortini's ) makes.  Of course, if I could make it I would weigh 200 pounds.   5. What are you doing this weekend?  My husband heads out of town so it's just me and the baby.  I look forward to cleaning the house and having it stay tidy for longer than 2 hours (but I will miss my husband).
