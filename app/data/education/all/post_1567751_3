I never knew  How much my sins cost Until I understood  The last words of Jesus Christ Upon the wooden cross –  “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”  I know How it feels to be abandoned: Betrayed, unloved and despised. But what has Jesus done to deserve this?  Then I remember that My dirty sins were cast upon His broken body –  The mocking crown of thorns His bleeding torn palms, His bruised fractured feet, His slashed wounded back.  As He took my sins upon Himself God’s holy presence had to leave Alone, He bore the pain of separation  And torture from His creation  The wages of sin is death And sins have to be paid, in full. Nothing in the world is free So He paid with His life on the tree.  I understood now Jesus made a choice, and paid the price. He became the Redeemer of sinful lives To release people from captivity Sinners just like me.  My sins directed Christ to the cross It was His love that brought Him there All because of me.
