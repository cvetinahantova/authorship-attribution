We are waiting! Six days ago we put in a bid for ocean view property in Baja and still we wait. This is our dream. We NEED this property. It is where we will spend endless days on the beach, hosting parties, relaxing, and our retirement. Great, have I jinxed it now, does this mean they will say no? More money, okay okay okay, anything! Of course Eric and I kick ourselves for not getting in years ago when we first thought of it and it was MUCH cheaper. Well, hindsight right? So, we wait. Everyday we hope for an e-mail, a phone call, something. Nada! I feel as though life is on hold. Not quite as bad as when we bought our home, but close. Well, I am going to go wait some more. Wish us luck!
