When you are the youngest of five children you often relish the opportunities that being alone can provide. One of the craziest years of my life was the year that my parents decided to lease a hotel and act as managers. One of the great things was that each of the kids got to have a room of their own and we also got to move around as vacancy allowed. My favorite TV show back then was Manix, it was a typical detective show that for some reason or another the star got wet in every episode. Sometimes he fell off a dock or boat and other times it was just like a drink spilled on himself. Anyway on one rare occasion I was laying on the floor in the TV room all alone watching Manix and this fairly large cockroach comes staggering out across the floor towards me. I watched it struggle along the floor and then remembered the exterminators had been there that day and the roach was probably dying. Just as this thought came to me the roach circled around then rolled over and then after a few seconds of leg twitching headed off to wherever roaches go when they die. I examined the roach a little while and decided I could get a lot better view if I were to pick it up with my toes and hold it over my face. I did and was studying the roach quite intently when I thought I felt it squirm and so I dropped it. Remember it was right over my face so I ended up dropping it into my right eye. My eye instantly started feeling like I had poured some acid in it and I ran to the bathroom to wash it out. My eye began to swell and eventually I could see nothing out of it. My right eye is still weaker than my left and I will always blame that roach.
