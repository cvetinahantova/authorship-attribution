Well here we go again on yet another moan. For the past 48 hours or so I have felt generally nasty. I didn't sleep very well on Friday night and was up at early o'clock Saturday morning so on top of feeling like poo I was knackered aswell!! According to all the journals and bits and pieces on pregnancy I should be in the 'blooming' stage..............blooming awful if you ask me!! There was me being all complacent thinking that this pregnancy would be the same as the rest. I should have realised things would be different as I am now that much older. I'm totally fed up with feeling ill and useless. It makes you feel like you're letting everyone down. The children have been on school holidays for the last 3 and a half weeks and we have done next to nothing because I just can't stand the heat and get out of breath so quickly. The house is being pretty much neglected. I'm trying to keep on top of things, but again I just can't, and if I do go all out to catch up I end up feeling a lot worse than I did anyway. It's a good job that I've got probably the most understanding husband in the world, however I can see the strain on him but just don't know what to do about it. I went to bed for a lay down yesterday afternoon and just cried and cried. I just thought that there was no reason for me to be around, that I was just making people unhappy and that I should not be such a burden. Luckily it wasn't too long before I dozed off because if my husband had seen me in such a state I know it makes him feel bad, and that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid. Oh well, I had a decent nights sleep last night so maybe today will be a bit easier (I hope!). Once more unto the breech............  lots of love Chickie xx
