I'm so tired, and swamped with homework. It sucks, because it's right before the holidays, and junk. I mean, do people not think of how sucky life is right now? Puh-lease. It's incredibly trying on my delicate self.   So tonight, the homework so far goes:  Pre-Calculus: 345654 problems, or just like 20? Honors English: LBD questions. Call Chantal, or whatever. Must get work done. AP World History: Comparative essay (Topic: China and Nile Valley) Honors Biology: Photosynthesis chart (took Cindy's), and questions Mock trial (which isn't even a CLASS!?!, the outrage): Questioning questions (yeah, that made no sense)  Le sigh. I also had to tutor Erin today for  Study Buddy . Geometry is the suckest math ever. I was trying to recall how to go triangle proofs. As if I can even remember those things. I managed to do the proofs, and semi-explain it to her. Kashifa Guria was  supposed  to help me with Erin, while Diana and Cindy tutored the other girl, but no. She was busy discussing video games, and junk. Sometimes, I get very aggravated (Cesar's expression, hee) with her.   I am hoping progress report grades are not done yet, so that my parents don't find out about my C+ in Pre-Calculus. I raised it to a B-, but it fell again. Also, hopefully, my biology grade has improved by, say, a whole letter grade? I wish. I suck this year.  In other news, Cesar rules. Rawr. The crew  (which includes the above mentioned people, plus Nikki) and I went on a quest (lol, I am so weird) to look for him at lunch, today. Instead we were attacked by a swarm of seagulls. Oh well, maybe next time. I can never find the boy.   Must depart. Love to all.
