it's been a good day  not productive, but good  talked online for a bit, officially got the call/chat from paul ellis that i'm next year's pizza seminar coordinator, went to panera and barnes and noble with colleen and scott, and now, after running from my car to the house in the rain, i'm drenched  one would think that i could get lots done in a bookstore since it's quiet and filled with books encouraging me to think and be good... guess again.  scott and me first beelined for the kids section where he read me "go dog go" and "a fly went by" (or something similar on the 2nd title)-- both dr. seuss... i got distracted by magazines and other fun... found the "is your mama a llama?" book again and got scott to read another one called "the grapes of math"... it was fun all around.  but how much work did i do?  1 problem that i had an idea how to solve before :-P  now dinner, and hopefully seeing "two brothers" with ben when he gets out of class... in a bit (once i have de-soaked) i also just have to scan the birthday card my dad sent this week -- it's great :-)  later dudes =)
