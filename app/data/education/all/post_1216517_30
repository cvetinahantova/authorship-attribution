3RD PLACE  I'm looking for my third place.  That's Starbucks lingo.  They market themselves as a "third place."  There's home, there's work, then there's the third place. Antelope Valley has a serious lack of third places.  Here's my top three: Starbucks w/drive thru, Library, and Barnes and Noble Starbucks. The Drive-thru Starbucks has the most atmosphere, for what its worth.   But come on, it's got a drive thru and that just puts all the workers on edge and makes me feel like I'm chilling in a McDonald's.  The Library is cool.  It's got books, ya know.  But it's also filled with crazied children and all of AV's derelicts including me. For now, my money's on the Barnes and Noble Starbucks, you can read the books there, ya got coffee, it's a combo.  It also feed my habit and provides me with up-to-date   travel guides  so I can dream about my around the world trip which is closer by the day.    I haven't really met anybody here.  I feel like the new kid in school.  I mean, what do I do go up to people and say, "Hi.  I'm Darren.  I'm new here."  Actually, that's not a bad idea.  I think I'll try it.  I've been using the make-myself-visable technique, hence the third place, but I might try that new kid thing now.  Speaking of hemroids, I was thinking about safety belts today.  When you think about it the whole thing is pretty weird.  We get in these metal machines and have to buckle ourselves down.  That's pretty odd.  We strap ourselves to chairs.  We do this everyday.  Am I the only one that finds this peculiar?  What ever happened to walking?  Remember that?  Or horses, they worked too.  No, now we must haress ourselves to fake leather to get where we want to go.  Thank God for progress.   urlLink Here's  what it's all about.
