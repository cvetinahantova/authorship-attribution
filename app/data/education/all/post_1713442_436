urlLink Scientifically Based Research: What Does It Mean for Counselors? ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Walz, Garry R. and Jeanne C. Bleuer.  It looks at scientific research as it relates to counseling.  From the ERIC Digest:  A core component of many new educational programs funded under Bush administration's No Child Be Left Behind Act of 2001 is that they be based on scientifically based research. Further emphasizing the important role that this type of research will play in future U.S. Department of Education priorities has been the establishment of the What Works Clearinghouse. Under the leadership of Dr. Grover Whitehurst, this new clearinghouse will "...establish standards for research and then determine...which studies meet those standards" (Taub, 2002).    Like others in the educational community, counselors and counseling researchers welcome the opportunity to empirically test the validity of their practices and then, just as important, demonstrate that what they do makes a positive difference in students' lives. But they also have many concerns about the practical feasibility of implementing scientifically based studies. The purpose of this Digest is to provide an overview of the characteristics of scientifically based research, compare it to other types of research, and address some of the challenges and issues that are particularly relevant to conducting scientifically based studies of counseling interventions. To accomplish this, the authors have included selected portions of the ERIC/CASS publication, Research in Counseling & Therapy (Loesch & Vacc, 1997).
