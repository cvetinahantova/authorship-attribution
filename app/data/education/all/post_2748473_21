I'm hoping that work will go very well today and that these kids aren't too crazy. I had a very......different weekend and looking forward to getting my bloodwork done tomorrow and getting all of this stuff sorted out. I feel bad of having such a bad influence on people I know because of me going nuts inside. I need to get all of my crap sorted out and then try to repatch some roads with certain people that I miss very dearly. I love you all. Pray for me.
