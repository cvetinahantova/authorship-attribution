Hi! I have been having a very mad day. Like today I awoke and I read a note that my boyfriend gave to me last night. In it he told me that the reason why he didn't come over or call me on Sunday (which was, of course, because he was high). I was really, really mad because of that. It made me think of my last boyfriend that used to never talk to me when he was high and he was  always  high so I wouldn't see him for weeks at a time. Durring that relationship I felt like I was the most worthless peson alive. Of course its been like a few months between then and now, but I still compair him to my recent boyfriend (which I know I should stop). Anyways I got to go because I'm talking to other people ;). so Bye!
