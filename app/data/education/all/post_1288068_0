Despite random lectures and other disjointed bits and pieces, tomorrow is to all intents and purposes our last day. At the moment I just feel very stressed as my folder is a big fat mess and I am looking at a long night of crazy before the morning of HOORAH! The other big ol' pisser is that I have to go to a flinging reps meeting tomorrow. Reps!? Who cares? I wouldn't bother if Barbara wasn't the chairman.  But never mind that just now:  TODAY WAS MY LAST EVER EVER EVER LESSON AS A STUDENT TEACHER.  There are many, myself included who thought this day would never come.   I am summoning the strength of ten tigers for one last time ... grrr!  Right then.
