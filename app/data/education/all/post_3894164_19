It is now the pleasure of the Illinois Grand Old Party to introduce to you their next candidate for United States Senator of the State of Illinois. Ladies and Gentlemen introducing Alan Keyes of the great state of Maryland. Thats right folks, the guy isn't even from Illinois. What a sham, and a shame.   Now some people will make the argument that Hillary Clinton wasn't from New York when she ran for Senate. True but correct me if I am wrong, but didn't she at least win the Democratic primary first? This guy didn't even inquire about the job. The GOP committee interviewed a number of different candidates before wittling it down to two finalists. Keyes, who by the way was never even interviewed by the committee and another woman, who also happened to be black. Keyes was interviewed the day after he became a finalist for the GOP choice. I am glad to see that the Illinois GOP still believes in grassroots democracy.  The Illinois Republican Party's choice of candidate just reflects how far this party has fallen in the past few years. It is tough to see how they will even have a chance to retain this Senate seat. Maybe this is just a sham by the party to keep people from coming out to vote in November. Put someone up for Senate that is so out of touch that people won't vote for him. And if people begin to think that this race is a joke, then they won't vote for the other guy either. Could be one hell of a way to try to swing a solidly blue state like Illinois over to the red column for Bush in the upcoming Presidential elections. Voter Disenfranchisement what wonderful concept.  God Bless the GOP and no one else...
