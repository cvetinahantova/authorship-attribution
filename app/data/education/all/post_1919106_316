I first started using Hello, and it was good. But there were some things that I didn't like, such as not being able to add a title to the post, or edit it otherwise directly within Hello, and of course it not being available for Linux. So I gave Flickr a spin. And it's good for quick posts, specially when I'm at work. But when their webpage was inaccessible today I ended up going back to Hello. And since it's free now, I thought of giving Picasa a spin. Boy is that a neat application for cataloging pictures. It's a keeper. I can see why Google invested in it.
