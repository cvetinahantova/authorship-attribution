I'm busy printing out programs for my wedding, and since I was bored I decided I might blog.  I really haven't got anything exciting to say, but that's ok....no one will read this anyway! :)  Spring semester grades are already posted!  I'm sad to say that my 4.0 Grad School GPA has been dashed to pieces by a wicked little A- that I got in that crappy EPS class I had to take.  Oh well, I'm surprised I didn't do worse considering the way I mouthed off to the teacher about what real education is like rather than listening to him talk about education as if it existed in a vacuum.  Still no word from the Peace Corps.  I'm starting to get really frustrated with them.  Luckily Ted is super-optimistic and keeps me from being overly anxious as I was from some government nurse to grant us the medical clearance we need to serve.  That's all there is.....  Does anyone have any good books I need to read this summer?  Oh wait, no one reads this so no one will answer....but if no one happens to have any suggestions I would more than welcome them!
