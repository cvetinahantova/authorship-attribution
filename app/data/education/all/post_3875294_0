This will be my last blog for almost three weeks, as we head out for the great state of North Dakota.  This will be my first time to that state, and I am very excited.  We will be staying with John's parents the whole time we are there.  Some things we plan to do include going to the ND state fair, driving up to Canada, and going down to Mt. Rushmore (sp).  So now, it's time for last minute packing!  My parents just left.  I gave them the tour of things to take care of, feeding Milo, his box (fun stuff), his snacks, the houseplnants, ant the mail.  The Rubesh's down the street will be watering our out side plants.  The patio looks so colorful and fun now that the summer patio furnature and plants are about it.  I'll return to this blog spot in about 2 1/2 weeks. Bye for now, J
