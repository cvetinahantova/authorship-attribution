What every teacher dreads hearing as conference week nears its end...   Student: Uh, Mrs. K? Me: Yes? Student: *long pause while waiting for me to look up* Me: Yes, I'm listening... Student:  My mom wants to know when her conference time is.  She didn't get the slip. Me:  It was yesterday at 2:30. Student: Yesterday?  Oh, well, she wants you to call her then.  What's happened here is one of two things.  Either the kid forgot to give Mom the conference slip and now is in big trouble because Mom missed the conference OR the kid gave the slip to Mom and she spaced out and is now trying to reschedule without having to call and admitt to me that she spaced out on her kid's conference.    Have I mentioned that I really hate conference week? (Tune in tomorrow for a revised sentiment regarding conference week, as I waltz out of here 2 and a half hours early since I stayed until 7:00 for two nights...)  By the way, it's my birthday.  Happy Birthday Me.
