I have nothing of interest to report from the past week or so, but I wanted to let you know that I haven't abandoned the self-promotional blog project. My days are majorly boring. All I do is pack stuff, clean (very little of that going on though), surf the web, and contemplate the  mystery  of the next couple of weeks. I haven't even been hanging out with friends, since most of them are out of town and I've lost touch with the rest so badly that I'm too sheepish to call them.   I've been wearing "disposable clothes" and will be doing so until I leave for Japan. It's good that I own so many shirts that I don't mind throwing out after one last wearing. Having to live out of a suitcase for a week is one thing, but having to live out of a  grocery bag  for another week before that just sucks. But I've got to have everything packed up and ready to ship or store days before I actually leave the U.S. (because of my apartment situation), so I have little choice. God, I hate moving.   I'll probably have one more update before I actually land in Japan, and then, with any luck, the hilarity ensues. Right now, I'll just send out wishes for a hassle-free summer for everyone else.
