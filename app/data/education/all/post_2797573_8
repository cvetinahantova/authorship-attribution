Time for my weekly update.  Our finances just seemed to go from bad to worse.  By Wednesday I was so depressed I finally did something I had never done before and hated to do.  I called my parents to ask for money.  It was hard on my pride because I am the oldest of 5 children and pretty much the only one who hasn't asked for help.  I like to be independent and think I have it all under control, but right now I don't.  We had a whole week to go before either of us was paid and we had a 7 dollar balance in our checking account.  We had been trying to get ahold of our lawyer the last month, but she seems so hard to talk to.  At one time I spoke to someone at her office and they said she would help reschedule our payment plan, but then I never heard anything more.  I also had been trying to access my retirement account to make an emergency withdrawal.  Nothing seemed to be coming together.  My parents offered to send a little money.  It is enough to get us through until Friday.  Another good thing is that we called the trustee and explained the problem we are having with our lawyer and they gave us a number to call to get help with this problem.  Things are gradually working out, but we are still sunk into a pretty deep pit.  On the good news side, the kids had their opening of the play they are in.  Friday night Joseph had a crisis.  He somehow was led to the wrong place for curtain call and came in at the wrong time.  He was very embarressed about it, but life goes on.  Then, on Saturday, Sarah's skirt was stepped on while she was going down some steps and it ripped pretty badly.  She was pretty upset.  I came to the theater on Sunday and repaired it.  It will be fine.  So after 2 tough nights, Sunday's performance went pretty smoothly.  I'm still kind of jealous about not getting a part.  I'm trying to be mature about it.  Sometimes it is hard.
