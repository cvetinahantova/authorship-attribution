Man, I thought I would be able to blog every night or at least every other night but I've been crazy busy and there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.  I am counting days (8) until I'm on vacation.  I need it sooooooooooo bad.  Problem is, I'm going to have to kill myself working late so I can feel OK about leaving my job in the state that it's in.  I so want to be caught up!  I'm sure I'll get there before the students get back, but usually I'm in an easier pace and get more rest and have steady productivity.  Part of my problem has been a lack of focus due to the office dynamics but that will change soon enough.  So much is on my mind... I have met someone on e-harmony who, so far, I have really clicked with.  He seems taken with me, and I'm hoping that I don't disappoint.  We are going to meet in person next week and I'm really excited about it.  He's funny, smart, quirky, full of energy, has a great voice, laugh, my age, taller than me, motivated, accepting, and hey, he thinks I'm beautiful!  Of course I gave him an array of pictures of me - from thin to now and I was up front about the now.  He doesn't seem to be shallow and he has struggled with weight too so he understands.    If he likes me "for me" and can accept me this way, when I do shed my protective layer, he's going to have a total package.  Maybe I can replace food with sex?  Ha ha ha!  He's really an interesting, unique person.  He seems intense.  We're both Scorpios, and I've read that could be bad.  I've experiences that before with an old boyfriends.  Lots of fireworks.  Well, enough for now.  I hope to keep this blog going but may not be able to get into the rhythm for a while.  I'll be on the road to Ohio this weekend.  Good Night Blogland!
