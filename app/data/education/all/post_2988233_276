My boys, the 3 youngest at least, have to have swords.    Thanks  Lord of the Rings .  Used too, their swords were branches they would break off the many trees in our yard.  When those were banned by the totally un-cool mom, they evolved on to bigger and better things.    Now, they are metal sticks, about a yard in length that one of them, has been kind enough to sharpen the ends of.  They even took duct tape and taped a handle across the bottom.  They actually looked pretty good.  Notice the past tense of looked.  As in "look good no longer".  They are gone.  Never to return again.  The un-cool mom has struck again.    I will gladly give up my cool status over these metal killing sticks.    In our time of having kids, all of my children have had at least one set of stitches (minus one very lucky child who has had none)  Last year alone we had 4 broken bones (all on the same child, 3 on the same arm.  )  and We have had at least 4 concussions.  2 of which were on the youngest son.  He just can't seem to stay away from a baseball bat while it is being swung by his oldest brother.    So see, we don't need metal sticks in the equation.  My boys hurt themselves plenty without any form of weapon.    One son got stiches from sleeping.  Yes, sleeping.  During the night, he moved to the foot of our bed, rolled over, hit the dresser and a rock weighing in at roughly 5 lbs, fell of the dresser and hit him in the temple.  He was bleeding profusly, and didn't even know it.  My oldest son walks in the room and starts screaming "Will's dying, Will's dying" Those words will make you move a little faster than normal.    The rock, had been painted gold in Vacation Bible School and said "Jesus is my Rock", now lives at Tommy's work, holding open the shop door.    Even sleeping is dangerous at my house.
