Well, on Saturday night I had my Teizan farewell enkai in Sendai.  I wasn't all that thrilled about having to attend but in many ways it was a good night. It provided me with a sense of closure about my year at Teizan and also enabled me to realize that in one week, my experience at this school will be over.  My supervisor didn't come, the only english teacher sitting at my table was the night school one who works with Dave (the two others I teach with said they can't speak English), and both the principal and vice principal made speeches saying that I also enjoyed working at Shiogama Girls School.  Yes, you read that correctly.  They both made speeches saying my visit school was the girls school when in fact I have always worked at Shiogama Boys. I am sure you now get a sense of how well they know me.  Anyway, after delivering a speech in Japanese and 2 hours of being genki (cheerful), the enkai ended and I had survived my final Teizan enkai.  That was the last of my school enkais hosted by both schools and now my nights will be occupied by the closer friends I have made during my year in Japan.
