Run Forest Run!  Okay! This is a new low for me—today I chased a kid down the hall to give him his rough copy, which I spent well over half an hour practically rewriting for him. The paper is the same one that I proofread for everyone else (the three-fourths that turned theirs in) yesterday, the one that is worth a test grade. He turned it in during first period, but after a quick glance at it I told him to come back after second period (he was only next door) on his way to the buses because it was obvious that his paper was going to take a lot of time to edit. I even told his second period teacher to please remind him to come see me after they dismissed class.  My class got out a few seconds earlier than the class next door, so I waited near their door. I heard the teacher remind the kid to come see me as the class was dismissed. I called the kids’ name as he walked past me, but he either ignored me or didn’t hear me. As I followed him down the hall occasionally calling his name, I heard other students turn to him and say, “Hey Richard, Mrs. Carr is talking to you.” I finally caught up to him when he stopped to wait for the buses (I was wearing heels—he wasn’t) and he acted embarrassed that I had stopped him. This kid asked me three or four times during first period if I was through editing his paper yet. Now, when I chase after him to give him something that I spent more than half and hour of my life on, he acts like I am putting him out.  I am not really sure what I am supposed to do when I give a kid every chance in the world and he doesn’t seem to want to take advantage of any of them!
