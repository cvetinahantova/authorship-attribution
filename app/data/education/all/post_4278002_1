I was going to wait until I got to Zhanjiang to put more thoughts out there, but I'm in the mood to articulate some thoughts now.  By the way, if you're actually reading this and checking out my blog, you rock!  I'm not sure who of you out there will do this, but I hope it's a fun way for those of you interested in my perception of a new culture to stay informed.          That aside, let's get down to business!  After a slow weekend start, Sunday rolled around and I wanted to go further into the city and explore some more.  Nate and I had not gone and explored as a couple yet since we're constantly surrounded by our fellow volunteers who have quickly become new friends.  Today was our only opportunity, so off we went...              I'm not sure why, but until today I haven't really felt like a foreigner here.  Pretty much everywhere you go, there is Chinese and English on the signage, and the majority of the people can speak English.  However, wherever we were today, we were constantly reminded of our non-Chinese backgrounds.  On a few of the crowded streets, Nate was definitely the only "white guy" and by far the tallest.  It was the first time since being here that people were staring at us with confusion.  Since this was my first experience with this in Hong Kong, I didn't really mind it.  It humored me up actually.  We found a Vegetarian restaurant (we somehow always manage to do this, don't we?!) and the server spoke to me in Cantonese the entire time.  Even though Nate would reply back to her in English or attempt to speak Mandarin, she just kept talking to me.  I found this rather strange since I clearly was not replying back.  I just smiled awkwardly and kept looking at Nate for assistance.  When our appetizer arrived, a beautiful shiny fork came with it - and it was clear that it was meant for Nate's usage.            The crowded market areas we ventured into had what I pictured China to have: lots of fresh produce, hanging poultry and old men with no shirts smoking.  It also had what I wasn't expecting: a kiosk just selling bras, fish and seafood practically jumping out of their shallow tanks onto the sidewalk, many 7-11 convenience stores, men butchering slabs of meat on tree stumps, and people burning things in tiny garbage cans.  I smiled when a girl walked by with a tank top that read: "I'm a mango girl."  The random written English phrases on some of the clothing here is hilarious.  I wonder if the Chinese characters on clothing in the USA is equally hilarious to Chinese people?          Hmmmm...maybe my experience today was preparing me for what life is going to be like in China.  Until today's adventure, I've been sheltered by being in very touristy areas of Hong Kong.  Wherever we were today, were not so touristy and for that I'm thankful.  I think I've been craving a more realistic experience of what it is like to be Asian-American in Asia.  Perhaps if you check back in with me in the middle of January, I may not be so cheery about this, but then again, maybe I'll be fine.            Good night all...it's past midnight here in Hong Kong.
