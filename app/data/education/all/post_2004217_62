Haven't blogged in a while...  Went to see Lostprophets on Thursday; totally amazing gig, Ian was way hot as usual- the support bands were shite but we had fun communicating by writing out what we wanted to say in the "Write Message" sections of our phones, lol... Sean was there, don't think he fancies me. Typical me, overanalysing someone just being nice. Valentine's Day came and went without excitement, except for a present from my mum of a little Jellycat with a shiny heart- ahhh. :o)  Sunday, Oli came over for dinner; I'm really worried. I found out why he really rang me in the middle of the night. And the most annoying thing is that I can't tell you (whoever may read this) about it, because it's... it's difficult. I haven't been told not to tell anyone, but I don't want to, because it's uncomfortable; it'd be a horrible feeling, having to tell everyone how what I thought was true, wasn't really at all... So for now, I will carry on like I only know what I knew on Saturday, and not what I found out on Sunday night.  Went to Dad's today. The sound of his voice makes me feel like someone's scraping their nails down a blackboard right behind me *shudder*. He's so loud! And he just spouts such crap all the time. He talks shit and he thinks he's right but in the end, he's just talking so he hears his own voice. Shut. the fuck. up.  Ceff x   A million miles from home...
