Today we skipped church in favour of celebrating fathers day. Got some nice presents off the kids - England tshirts and shorts. Popped over to see my Dad, who was well considering and the kids enjoyed seeing him. We also visited Sandra's Dad on the way back. During the afternoon we all went for a cycle ride down the canal's - my bike lost its gear cable, but we managed. Tea was great - roast beef and ice-cream. The evening was frustrating, as I thought Sandra and I might have a night cuddled up, but it didn't happen.
