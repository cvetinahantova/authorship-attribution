Debra - I have never received any info about the heart monitor that I wanted to buy.  Last time we spoke there was two left, and you marked me down for one of them.  I forget who has them, but can you bring one to the run on sunday.  I'm writing this at 11:00 pm on Saturday, so you may not see it.  Please call me so that I can come and get it some time soon!!!  Thanks.  Sheila Reilly 858-775-0035.
