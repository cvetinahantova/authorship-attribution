Hmm. I don't really remember Tuesday or Wednesday.   This morning I woke up late since I had an orthodontist appointment. I got to school in the middle of second period, just in time to play a fun game in Spanish, called Subjunctive Relays or something like that. It was loads of fun.  Math was incredibly boring...but I have a B in the class, and that's not bad. This math class is so much better grade-wise than last semester, but I miss all my first semester buddies. I didn't like Mrs. Mirabile, but I loved all the psycho people in that class!  Biology was stupid. Just plain stupid. STOOOOOPID (yes, I know I spelled it with *counts*five O's).   The invite for track...IT WAS RAINING AND COLD!!!!! ARGHHHH!!!  I ran my two-mile, and it was the second to last race. I got a personal record, and got third place. Yay...*eye roll* I have 14 varsity points. Yay.  I'm really worried about Amanda. She's so depressed and I'm afraid of what she's doing to herself but she won't tell me anything. She won't talk to me about  *it* , and I'm starting to get scared. I don't know what to do. I'm scared...  So exhausted...   "...And nothing else matters..."  --Metallica
