Everyone is starting to look alike; not quite identical; similar akin to different brands of bike  My peers are such repetitive sights with the same clothes and the same hairstyles and the same tastes...  They all share the same plight: too much time and money  coupled with no need to fight  These people do not think about survival -  let alone ethics, morality, mankind or even whether everything seems uniform  Alas, I am guilty as well I sport a generic haircut Overpriced designer jeans and grew up in a comfortable home in an upscale suburban hellhole  And I wonder why our elders see us as herds
