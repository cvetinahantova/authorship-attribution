urlLink Napster.com  It's back!  And it is legal this time.  The file sharing pioneer service is back with tunes.  Customers can dowload song tracks for .99 cents.  This is cheap and affordable.  Being able to legally download music for less than a dollar a tune should encourage many users to stop pirating.  I downloaded a few songs I wanted.  I couldn't find a few others.  The Napster library needs to expand.  The fate of Napster will make for some good class discussion points.  If it makes it, we can lecture about how copyright and intellectual property are important and are preserved in the new Web world.  If Napster goes belly up, we can lecture on how creativity is being stiffled by piracy.  Either way and we have a good example to discuss copyright with our students.
