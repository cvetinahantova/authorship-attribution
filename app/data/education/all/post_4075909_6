I forgot to mention. I don't know if anyone knows, (and I'm sure all the lesbians have the notice), The L Word will be released on November 9th 2004. This is one day before my birthday and I will purchase said product. Now, before all of you out there who hate The L Word because it is not an accurate look at lesbian life. Let me counter by saying a few words. First, unlike those men who say they read Playboy just for the letters, I admit I watch The L Word strictly for the porn. Those women scare me sometimes and half of them I would never get involved with except for a one night, (yes the big talker I am). Second, this is a soap opera. When watching regular soap operas do you think these things really happen? I mean how many people do you know come back from the dead? Or how many people do you know have a child in 1990 who is 25 in 2004? Not many. How many people can afford those houses? Even Sex and The City, come on. But, we still watch that. Third, this is done by the same women who developed Go Fish, Rose Trouche and Guinevere Turner. They were praised 10 yrs. ago for the raw look at lesbian life. So I say, bring on the lesbians and thank you Ellen!
