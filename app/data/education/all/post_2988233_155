I know this isn't a very popular opinion, but I am so glad Georger Huff got voted off tonight on American Idol.  Phew, there for a while I thought he might just make it all the way.    Now it is all ladies.  Hmmmm, Jasmine should be next, then either Diana or Fantasia.  Latoya will win.  Those are my predictions.  Don't make any bets becuase of them!
