whet this appetite in exploration  of all our mysteries swollen like me like you this rapture is an extension  from the glow of our satiating one another  in this moment pleasure invokes a new course and a new touch senses lit up by  this peak experience everything comes together comes outside of borders simply comes  spent we find a new rhythm entwined in afterglow in aftertaste  as one we fall asleep into this endless dream of Love  Â© 2003 DC Vision
