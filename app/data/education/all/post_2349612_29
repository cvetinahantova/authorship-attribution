so an offer came up that i couldn't refuse =P  i'll be MIA for the next day or so, so don't freak out that my blog currently ends on a very blah note and that my phone's off and that i'm not on IM or responding to emails at present.  a spiffy friend just gave me the opportunity to take a break from reality of sorts and i'm all about that, so i wholeheartedly accept... i'm fine, and i'll be back eventually.  later all, and have a good weekend.
