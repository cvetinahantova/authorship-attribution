I've been watching the convention as I prepare to move to New York. I'll actually be in New York City for the Republicans, but I'm having to watch the Democrats from my own living room.  Despite what everyone has been saying, I've found it pretty exciting. Yesterday I watched the Clintons speak. I just don't think Hillary has the presence to be a national political figure. But Bill is great. He looks like he's lost weight. And even  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  thought his speech was jaw-droppingly good.   CLINTON AT HIS BEST: Carter's was the better speech, but Clinton was magnificent. I think he was better last night than at either of his own conventions and certainly better than any of his SOTUs. He performed a brilliant rhetorical trick: he deployed the usual canards used against him to buttress Kerry. Rather than attack the wealthy as recjpients of tax cuts, he attacked himself as a now-wealthy man. And then the coup de grace: he put himself and Bush in the same camp as draft-dodgers, in stark comparison to the patriotic Kerry! My jaw was on the floor at that point in a mixture of admiration and horror. But it was mighty effective. And the way in which he described the cost of the tax cut in terms of squandered attempts to improve homeland defense was another smart move. Use the Republican tax cut issue against the Republican security issue. Wedge against them for once. If the constitution didn't prevent it, the man would still be president. After last night's speech, you can see why.    In fact, in general, I like Sullivan's comments on the conference and it's been a while since I've liked his writing. Sullivan also agrees that Barak Obama was fantastic. He is smart and sensible and attractive.   We listened to Kennedy on the radio. I didn't mind his talk, but others found it tiresome. Ron Reagan, Jr., was good, I thought. He looks a lot like his father.
