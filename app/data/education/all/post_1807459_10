Wow yesterday drug on forever.  I need to do something about the light that starts pouring into my room around, oh I don't know 7:30.  A suggestion was made to get one of those winter caps and pull it over my eyes.  I think this has a lot of merit.  I did this last year and I'm annoyed at myself for having not brought this cap back over.  In other news tomorrow is Halloween and I'm excited.  I need to start going out in the week to break things up.  I find myself with a lot of time on my hands.  I have been doing things constructive and worthwhile like reading and studying and whatnot but I feel the need to be a little more reckless and kill some more brain cells.   In an effort to decorate the school for Halloween my manager and teachers have managed to make the school look a 4th of July party.  For those of you who don't know the 4th of July is America's Independence Day.  There are red, white and blue banners hanging from the ceiling now.  On another twisted note the other decorations look like they are for Christmas.  Whatever, I guess the kids won't know the difference, they have no clue what Halloween is.   Anyone want to see The Matrix 3 opening night?  I think I want to.  I don't think it'll be too packed.  I went on opening night when the last movie opened and there were plenty of seats.  I figure we can watch the movie and then go out afterward.
