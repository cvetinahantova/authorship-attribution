I just wanted you all to know that I got a ride for the doctor's apointment.  Debi's going to take me.  She mentioned something about just taking me back to her house afterwards, too, but I'm not sure if we're going to do that or if I'll just end up vegging at my house.  We'll talk about it Sunday, I imagine.   Mmm.  I'm getting a massage on Sunday.  And for really stinkin' cheap.  Mr. B, from on campus, is going to give me a 1-hour massage for $30.  I'm so excited!   Anyway, that's all I wanted to tell you today.  I need to get home now.  It's been a long day.
