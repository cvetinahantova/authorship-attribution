I guess I’m falling for you tonight…  I don’t know why…  Just the mention of your name makes me smile   Everytime your e-mails in my inbox arrive…  I’m feeling the urge to open it…   When you send me that special message  In my phone…  I’m feeling so special, so honour by you…   My special someone  that I know just by a chance  My special someone…  that appears every day in my inbox
