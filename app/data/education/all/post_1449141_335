Hundreds of gay and lesbian couples -- U. S. Citizens -- have married in Canada, and they are married... The American people have a choice in how they are going to treat their fellow Americans. They can treat them with respect, dignity and fairness, or they can discriminate against them.   We urge Congress to reject the Federal Marriage Amendment.  It represents the divisive and discriminatory politics of the past.  We urge you to reject this political attack on gay and lesbian families.'   - National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute Director Sean Cahill    "
