People do not post blog entries or even live journal entries for themselves.  They do it in the hopes of communicating with others.  Diaries that are written are unique in that the writing takes place in secret, and for no one else.  If anything, the addressee is the future, perhaps the future writer him/herself. But the future is vague.  In order for us to talk to ourselves, our subjectivity must be split.  There must be an object, a "me" to talk to.  It is impossible to purely talk to oneself.  We invent an addressee, give her a history, imagine that she has solidity as we ourselves do.  Of course, this has been thought in poststructural thinking before, where linguists have discussed how alienation actually works linguistically.  But older than this, before we had selves, we sat around and talked to each other.  Like Bakhtin says, to another, whose body begins where mine ends.    If we truly know ourselves, why do we produce so many narratives about "ourselves", this entity we invent? Who are we actually talking to?
