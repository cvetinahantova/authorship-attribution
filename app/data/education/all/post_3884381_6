Last night was my initial viewing (and most likely not my last) of the new extremely intelligent comedy, "Anchorman".  When I say intelligent, what I really mean is completely mindless.  Rarely do I see comedies in the theatre. If I am going to part with seven to ten dollars of my hard earned money to see a movie...I want to make it count.  I want epic.  I want huge stars.  I want thought provoking.  I want a running time of over 89 minutes.  "Anchorman" was none of these.  But, oh, was it worth it.  I have never seen a comedy in the theatre where I left in pain.  "Anchorman" almost killed me.  It was an hour and change full of chuckling, tears and knee slapping.  Hysterical is an understatement.  I feel like I should recommend it.  Or should I?  They nearly pulled off this riot without the use of bad language, but alas, they gave in.  So as I comforted Kyle at 3:00 in the morning (swimming - water in his ears), I started wondering...how do I react?  I want to tell everyone how hilarious this was.  But as a Christian, can I do that?  I mean, it wasn't excessive violence, nudity or any "evil" themes.  It was just a little bad language.  And, I actually already have recommended it...I told one of good friends to go see it while in California.  Was that wrong?  Did I make a mistake?  I saw this flick with some of the people who I see as great Christian mentors in my life.  How do they react to the language?  Are we supposed to just "overlook" it?  Much prayer will follow.  So...should I "drop" the anchor?
