hello everyone,  well i just saw a good movie. "mr. ibrahim"  it was based on a book.  anyway it was good. i won't give away any details, but i'd recommend it to all ages to see.  school is going fine.  i had a good time with all of my classes today.  also, i got to sub for the p.e. teahcer this morning.  i watched the girls play a thai version of tag.  they all stand in a circle, but they are in pairs.  one girl chases another girl who runs inside or outside of the cirlce. the chasee tags a girl and that girls partner has to run without being caught.  once someone is tagged they are "it" and the chase is reversed.  o.k. i hope all that made sense.  i'm moving into my place tomorrow.  i'm excited to have my own space.  also, it's great to know people in the same building so all i have to do is knock on a door to have someone to hang with.  i worked out at the gym today.  it's a really nice gym.  also, the equipment uses pounds so it's easy for me to know exactly how much i'm lifting.  well i've gotta run.  hope everyone is enjoying their summer.  it's actually not been too hot here so all ya'll in mississippi enjoy. ha. jk.  i miss you very much and hope whoever would like to will come see me.  jane
