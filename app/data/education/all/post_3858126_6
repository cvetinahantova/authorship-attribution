In the header at the top of my pages you can read about inflatable babies. Well, apparantly Egypt has sold out of these and the only things available to replace them are black and white inflatable cows, complete with bright pink udders. The guys selling these are carrying 20 or so inflated cows under one arm and a bag of fake noses that make silly sounds when you blow them. Now isn't that exactly what each resident of Cairo is sadly lacking?   Saw "The Day After Tomorrow" today... Man that's some scary movie. No monsters. No aliens. Just stupid people who didn't take care of the beutiful planet they inhabited and it bit them back. Now who are those stupid people?????? This is the movie that all governments should watch to gain a complete understanding of just what a mess we have made of the planet! We need to wake up and take some responsibility for our actions!   (Steps down from soapbox)   Calls from strange guy = 0  Hooray!   Considered depositing his ring in a shop display but then the good conscience woke up and said that was a mean idea!   Going to be taking a holiday to England from tomorrow 3:45am. Tooooooo early! The temperature may be a little warmer there than it has been but it will still be like going to the ice age for me. At least half the daily temperature.   I will still contribute to my daily(ish) diary but it will have to be sensible stuff. That is if I survive the first ten minutes with the road system. Here I walk in the middle and cars honk and avoid me - there... I'll be squished. So wish me luck!   Pleasant dreams!
