I've had it with people associating boolean values with 0 and 1. That is a C-ism, but ends up being thought of as a universal case. That is  wrong . Very, very wrong. There is nothing special about 0 that makes it false. Zero is just another number. It is one of a set, be it Integers, Real numbers, or Fractions.  Now, take the value  false  on the other hand. It explicitly declares falseness, so it's a true false boolean value. It is a  nice  false, and gives you no chance of looking at it and think "Oh, it says false, so it must be true".  And while we're covering the topic of sets, let's add  nil  as well. Nil does not represent an empty set - it represents no set at all. It's nothingness. Not nil is something. And something, except  false , is true. So not true is false. To look at it in another way, always remember that "Nothing but false is false". Nil is nothing. So nil is false.  And that's the entire collection of falesess representatives:  false  and  nil . Everything else has  true  associated to it. Now don't let me ever catch you again trying to sneak in a  0 == false .
