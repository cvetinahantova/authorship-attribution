Have you ever notice how relaxing pulling weeds can be.  I didnt' know this until today.  Renee was down here, and we were looking at my much neglected flower garden, and started pulling weeds.  I suddenly found my self not wanting to get up.  I just wanted to sit and pull weeds.    I know nothing about flowers.  Zero, zilch, nada, big fat O, but now I may have to learn.
