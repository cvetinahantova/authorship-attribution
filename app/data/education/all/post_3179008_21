Friday, ahhh. I love it. We are leaving the campus to go on an outside activity. The weather is fine, and the water shouldn't be too cold. Last time I went out there with the school, we say two eagles perched on a high pine tree. One was a mother bird with a large fish draped over a branch. The other was smaller, probably a youngster.       The outings are a huge benefit to the staff and the students. Considering the work we do, it isn't surprising that I feel that way.
