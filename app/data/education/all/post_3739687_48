hello,  well i caught a girl attempting to cheat yesterday.  i was invigilating  (which btw means standing in front of a class a looking at them take a test)  anyway... on one of my trips around the room i saw thai writing on a girls  leg.  i couldn't read it and i didn't want her to know that i saw it so i  just watched her during her math exam.  she wasn't looking at her leg so i  figured it was for her next exam which was in thai.  anyway... i told one of  the thai teachers and they busted her.  apparently it was for her next exam  and i caught her just in time.  GO ME!  my question is WHY CHEAT!  you can't fail so why bother to cheat.  hell, the  school does it for you! i just don't understand this place sometimes.  i'm  also not looking forward to grading my exams.  the kids take them tomorrow.   who knows if they even studied.  well other than that things are going great.  i had three things to attend  last night, but i only made it to two.  i guess that's o.k. the first was a  b-day party for a guy from london.  it was lots of fun.  almost everyone  that i like from work was there.  the next was a going away party for a girl  from france.  she went with me to ko chang.  eve is her name and i think i'm  really going to miss her.  we had just started to talk and now she is gone.   well thank god for the internet.  i've gotta run.  i hope everyone is enjoying the fair.  love ya.  jane  btw if anyone wants off of my email list let me know.  since i have the blog  set up it might be easier for you to just check it periodically.  if you  need the link i can send it to you again.  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.
