2  Dear Blog 8  Monday and Tuesday were not nearly as interesting  1  as  8  the weekend.  So this really does not sound  5  like a poem, but i  9  gotta keep goin, cause once you start somethin you    7  gotta finish it.  Or so THEY say. 8  Put the cookies on the tray.  Drank lemonade. 4  Fifth grade graduates chomped. 4  Fourth grade girls romped.  Emilie got the Language Arts award for her writing skills.  Her poetry folder inspired my Telephone poem.  Her classmates voted her Most Trustworthy which she wasn't too thrilled about.  Not sure what she wanted, I think most athletic, which went to Jackie.  This girl who was helping us serve cookies and punch says "Well, my class gave me Best Sense of Humor.  But only because there was nothin left!  I'm not even funny!"  I quelled my instinct to hug her and tell her that you don't have to be funny yourself to have a good sense of humor.  She seemed ok with it though, just peeved. Here's part of one of Em's poems:  15 maybe 16 Things I worry about   1.  My parents go to jail  I won't write the rest of it without her permission, cause it is pretty personal, but WHAT???  Why is her first worry that her parents will go to jail?  Are we too vocal in our disdain for the President of the United States of America?  (My country tis of thee) Was it because of that time the neighbor called the cops on Trevor?  (Sweet land of liberty) What the hell?  She's more worried about us going to jail than she is of us dying.  She says they weren't in order though.  Anyway, I better go work on my portfolio so i can get a JOb so i can keep out of trouble and stay outta jail...
