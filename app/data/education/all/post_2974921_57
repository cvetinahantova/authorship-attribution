i am now convinced that human's can be sick by nature. i've been watching MGB for quite a while now and i've come to the conclusion that more and more murders are being committed. there was this one time where this pretty lady was raped and killed by this drunk guys in her condo. then there was this guy who was burned by the guy who had a big debt to him. it was just sick... sometimes, it's freaky to think that i'm capable to do that. when i told my bro that it was really scary why these happen, he said it was better here because people kill with a reason but in the US, people kill for nothing... like they kill for fun... now,  that  is sick.   [please don't curse me, may you guys rest in peace...]  what if some of the victims were deserving of their death? could it be possible that the press always brand the victims as the innocent ones and the killers as the guilty? just trying to be unbiased...  *** i can't believe i'd be going back to school in two days. i'm kinda scared... of the "newness". but i do have something to look forward to on the first day. jammi told he'd come since their first day is on wednesday. i told him not to come but i really hope he would. ^_^  *** i'm gonna miss jammi. we won't be able to talk too much this schoolyear... =(
