Oi vey! Can I just say that??? I'm getting so sick of myself... So, there was this guy I was in this play with back in October. He fell for me- and at the time, it seemed pretty bad. You know, he was a great guy- a lot of fun, easy to talk to, some really cool insights into the world. And really, I liked him- a LOT. But you know what? He wasn't a Christian, so obviously, I told him "No." Twice- in no uncertain terms. (In fact, I warned him away from me- he knew I was struggling, and I told him that there was no way I could give up my relationship w/ the Lord for ANY guy- and that he would just get hurt.) OK- so fine and dandy. He backed off, and I am assuming, went on with his life. So what's my problem? I'm still thinking about him- in JUNE (almost July). I still dream about him, wish I could talk to him... GRRRRRR. I turned him down. I told him no. I haven't even SEEN him since January (God's made sure of that.) I KNOW he's not right for me- and yet...  I've prayed about it. I've begged God to take my feelings away (or to save him so it would be cool!) but to no avail. I've tried being interested in other guys. I even went on Eharmony- and all I kept thinking was that none of the guys fit right- I kept freakin' comparing them to a guy that I can't have and really, I know I don't want to have.  WHAT IS MY PROBLEM?????!!!! AM I DEMENTED OR SOMETHING????? Ok. I'm done. If you see this- pray for me. Thanks :)
