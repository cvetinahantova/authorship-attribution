I fucking hate every fucking thing about my fucking job. Ok I feel a little better now. I had to do something so I didn't cry. Ok so I'm a little emotionally unstable this week anyway, if you know what I mean, so that's probably the reason for the almost tears. But I mean come on........I just got hit with several things this morning that just about pushed me over the edge of reason. First, my stupid group from China freakin shows up today.......Mother Effer! I am not excited about that......this means that I get to work my ass off (for no money mind you) to get them caught up without bringing the rest of the class down. So wonderful......I'm very excited at the thought of that..fucking yippie. And then I go in and the class bitch as I have dubbed her because that is what she is, tells me she has a "village idiot" question/comment....which in bitch language means I want to insult you so please stand here and take it while I tell you that you do a bad job. She wanted to tell me that she didn't under stand that when the training schedule  sheet said "read the first 3 chapters in your ops manual" that that means the same thing as "read the first three sections" (and I had told her before she left that the homework was to read the first 3 tabs---serously I said it like 5 times!!) She got all confused because that tabs don't say chapter..........OMG use your effing brain!! Is it that hard? Has it been in storage for a long time??? This really wouldn't have been that big of a deal had it not been the same woman who has been rude the whole time she's been here. I don't know, I'm just having a bad day and needed to vent. Ok I'll probably be venting later too.........lol.
