I have tried the Microsoft Web Data Administrator as an interface to SQLExpress, and it is fine, but I have decided to use  urlLink QALite  from now. It allows me to work much faster than having to go through the Cassini Web Server. It is a free download and comes with documentation at the link provided in this entry.
