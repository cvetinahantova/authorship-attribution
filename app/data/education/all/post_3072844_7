Bored in IT. I am supposed to be doing some database work but my teacher isn't here and so i can't be bothered cos non of us no what we are supposed to be doing!  All my mates are injured.  Aileen fell down the stairs how stupid she has a massive bruise on her leg.  Ceci pulled her hamstring durin a rounders game on monday and i went over my ankle and i still hav it strapped up for support! Emma and mary are the only ones who havn't done something to themselves.  So i need to go and do something useful with my time.
