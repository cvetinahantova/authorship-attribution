Our fort was built from scrap wood we swiped from the construction sight just across the creek.  We had hauled the pieces down by the railroad tracks every day.  PK had picked this location because it was on the land owned by the convent and he knew the nuns never did come around there.  On one side there was a hill running up about twenty feet to the tracks, the creek was on the other side, surrounding the rest of the fort were pine trees and other scrub brush.  We called the place Fort Lima because that was part of the convent name. The Sisters of Saint Rose of Lima, PK had lived at the convent since first grade until his Dad got out of jail.  That had only been a year or so ago.  PK never would tell us why his Dad had been in jail or for that matter where his Mom was.  PK was the official leader because in the first week he got to town he had beat up each of us.  We built the fort so that we all could have a place to go with no big brothers, no little sisters, and mostly no adults telling us what to do.  Ronny, Spider, PK, and me The Kingfish had been friends since the first grade. PK had bright red hair it seemed almost orange in the bright sun, he was the only redheaded kid I knew that didn’t have any freckles.  Ronny was kind of slow witted but he was strong.  People always thought he was sweet when they first met him but he was mean.  He had a little brother that he used to lock in a closet and put Pink Floyd’s  “Dark Side of the Moon” on the record player, which really seemed to freak his little brother out.  Spider’s Mom was really old, he had 4 older brothers but none of them had lived at home since 1972, so Spider pretty much had been on his own for 3 years.  He was kind of a runt, we always made him act lost if we needed a distraction in a public place because people thought he was six and could throw a good little tantrum if he wasn’t tended to.
