I have already had a day and a half.  I got up early, went and cleaned Tommy's work, been tothe bank, walmart, my parents, dairy queen, and am getting ready to go to the light co.  It's not even 1pm yet!!!!!  I am on the ball today.      Tomorrow is Jamie's birthday.  He will be 8.  He is such a sweet kid.  Honestly.  He is so shy, he won't hardly talk to anyone, even family.  Just stands around smiling at you.  He is so full of love, he showers his mom and dad with kisses and hugs all day long.  My precious sweet Jamie.
