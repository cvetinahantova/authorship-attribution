Ronald Reagan remains a source of controversy for many, but he was the president of my youth.  Perhaps I appreciated the office more when I was younger.  I used to work as the Executive Director of a state-wide non-profit and lost much of my youth idealism regarding government when I actually had to work with politicians.  I used to think that politicians were altruistic people who wanted the most good for the most people.  Now I have discovered that most politicians are just like everyone else.  I always thought they should be BETTER somehow.  Growing up is a hard thing...  Reagan was the first president I ever voted for.  Are there things in retrospect that I have problems with?  Sure.  Look at his lack of involvements in dealing with the AIDS crisis.  So many people died needlessly.  But the man did inspire confidence and patriotism, things that I have not felt since his presidency with any of his successors.  It's hard to think that my students have no idea about the fear that the Cold War gave us, and I am deeply grateful for that.  I did believe then, and still do to some extent, that Reagan wanted to become president for the greater good and not completely for own his self-glorification.  I wonder if I will ever feel inspired by another president in the same way?  I do feel sorry for Nancy Reagan.  What a horrible existence watching your beloved slowly fade away.  Ronald Reagan has truly been gone for years.  I only hope that some good will come out of this and people will see the need for research using fetal cells.  I doubt that the powerful right-wing, pro-life lobby will ever let this happen.  These folk make it ever so hard to be a moderate Republican.  One thing is for sure, I shan't be voting for George W. come November.
