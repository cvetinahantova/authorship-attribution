So, after a not-so-lengthy discussion with Kat, I have cleared my messy mind up a little. In the relationship department anyway:  I don't want commitment, or anything heavy and intense, but I do want something exclusive. I don't want to get into any kind of heavy duty physical *ahem* activities too fast, but I don't mind a little messing about. I don't want to feel like I have to bring him (whoever it may be) to every event that I go to because he's my "boyfriend" (I refer to an instance when Laura pestered me to bring Luke to her birthday party even though I didn't want him to come), but I don't mind calling him "my boyfriend". I want something easy and fun, something that's chilled out with a lots of flirting but without having to change my life. I want good conversation as well; I don't want everything I say to be met with "awwww" or "oh how sweet" or "bless" or some other disgustingly patronising comment because he hasn't listened, or understood what I said. Is that so much to ask? ;o)  It's just that I can't stand all that *stuff* that's attached to having a boyfriend! The way people expect you to be attached to each other all the time, and have "quality time" together, or spend ridiculous amounts of money on each other because you're "in love". The way they act surprised when you just spend time with your friends, or chilling out on your own; I don't understand these girls that give up their whole lives, their friends, the way they are, just to be with one guy. How can you spend that much time with someone and not get bored anyway? OK, not get bored, but at least need a considerable break from each other afterwards.  Well, that helped. I feel much clearer in my head now, and don't feel the need to write about whatever I'm reading/revising as a distraction technique.  Ceff x   There's nothing to lose; my notebook will explain...
