So I've been wondering, maybe someone will know the answer.  Why is it that on our current calendar, September, October, November and December have prefixes that mean different numbers than their months represent?  Sept is seven, Oct is eight, Nov is nine and Dec is ten, but September is the ninth month and so on.  Anyone know?
