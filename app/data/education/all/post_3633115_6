Starkle Starkle Little Twink, Who the heck you are I think. I'm not under what you call, The alcofluence of incohol. I'm just a little slort of sheep, I'm not drunk like tinkle peep. I don't know who is me yet, but the drunker I stand here, the longer I get. Just give me one more fink to drill me cup, 'Cuz I got all day sober to Sunday up.                  --Unknown  This was given to my by a friend of mine in high school.  It is amazing what one finds when looking through old files.
