CNN.com - New Jersey governor quits, comes out as gay - Aug 13, 2004  : "(CNN) -- Dropping a political bombshell, New Jersey Gov. James McGreevey announced his resignation Thursday after revealing that he is gay and that he had an adulterous affair with a man."    Wow. Heard about this last night, but still don't quite know what to make of it. As a former Jersey resident and half-hearted democrat, I was never that fond of McGreevey. But this is just one huge mess. Apparently, McGreevey was forced to go public because the guy with whom he had an affair was going to file sexual harassment charges against him; the why is unclear. But the waters get further muddied by the fact that McGreevey isn't resigning until mid-November, after elections, so that the Democrats will hold office till the end of his term. Like I said, a total mess. I just hope that whatever flak he receives, it will not focus so much on it having been a   homosexual   affair as on the fact that it was an   extra-marital   affair.
