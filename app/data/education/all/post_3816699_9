I know that i have a terrible habit of doing so, but i always feel as if i am so depressed, as if everything isnt going mi way... i think that I am selfish, and that I think too much of myself... This is just mi intro of my Blogging... Just to see the immature acts that I seem to always get myself caught in... We'll see if i can keep up with this whole thing. Seeing as I am realli not that dedicated of a person... fuck this shit... That's my quote... It's what I live by, but we will see if that changes... Right now... I think mi moods are; -Jealousy -Anxious -Unhappy AArrgghhhh... I just don't know what to do anymore... I think of giving up a lot... But I think i have too much of a good life to give up so early, althgouh a lot of depressing thoughts wander through mi mind as if it is the eternal walkway to hell...  I feel so Fucked... There is too fucking much going on right now... And mi letter to God is obviously not being recieved seeing as, no one is doing anything about mi problems... I guess no one realli cares... but then again... it is always up to me about mi choices... I think I am going to go and watch the Czech game! I hope we win...! =]
