My unconditional love for you  is never die  Thought You so far away  out of my reach  Thought we never meant to be...   I give my unconditional love  without asking in return...  Call me naive,call me a dreamer..   How can I deny if I am  so in love with you..  How can I reject this feeling,if it  feels so good inside  everytime I thought of you...   My heart warms,my soul at ease...  When I think of you  every night,every day..  of my life
