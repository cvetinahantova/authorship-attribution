The joys of being single:  Letting the kids eat one more cupcake because they're going to dad's for the night.  Trading in the minivan for a 2-door, not because it's practical or makes any kind of financial sense, but because you can.  Getting a tattoo of a fairy, not because the (eventual) grandkids are going to want to look at Granny's fat ass, but because, for the first time in years, your body is your own.  When you are married, you are someone else's property, male or female.  That sense of liberation is undeniable.  So you date outside your religion, outside your race, outside your species, because you can (and it makes your sister crazy).  You paint the kitchen at 2:00 a.m., not because it needs painting, but because there's no one to tell you, "come back to bed, it's 2:00 a.m."  You build a fire in the fireplace and toast marshmallows in July, because you can.  You accept that some people won't approve of your new single-ness, stay home if you don't have a date, or go out alone; you make all these choices because you no longer belong to someone else, but to yourself only.  You do all these things (and lots more, I suspect), because you can.
