The sun’s graceful fingers Tease the Brisbane River playfully My sunken soul is ignited with a sparkle As the sky meets the earth with such dancing glee  Bright yellow sunflowers Adorn green fields and my backyard Such pretty things of nature God’s creation to warm our cold hearts  A rainbow in the sky Reminds me of God’s covenant to man Never again will a flood destroy all life On His faithfulness man can always depend  The puffy white clouds Overflow with God’s glory As it rains His grace pours out Providing dry souls rest and recovery  All glory and praises to God For He has given me life and hope My King my Redeemer and my Lord  No more in darkness again I’ll grope
