I had no sleep at all last night (Rob came into our bed at midnight and stayed there) he's such a damned fidget. I could hardly get out of bed this morning and slept right through the alarm for an hour. When I did get up, I had to iron my trousers and shirt and find my footie kit for tonight, so I thought I would be very late. Sandra actually gave me a hug this morning. She put one arm round me and sort of snuggled me. Our kiss "bye" was still just a peck though.
