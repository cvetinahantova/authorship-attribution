Well, what a day- I'm glad we finished early, I don't think I could have made it through German last period.   I got some work back off Mrs. Rogers today- 14/20, Level 4 standard, well done Ceffy. What I didn't realise, was that Mrs. Rogers had photocopied my essay- she then proceeded to hand it round the class and spend 15 minutes picking it to pieces in front of everyone. Pointed out allllll the bad bits... pointed out 1 good bit... ignored the fact that in her comment (only shown on my copy- everyone else's photocopy was covered with a copy of the mark scheme) she had used the phrase "this is an  excellent  summary"... Asked me what my last sentence meaned... I explained it to her... her response: "Well, I still don't understand it- does anyone else understand it?" to which no one raised their hands (Thanks Guys)... then I got a half hearted apology and an admittance that she "probably should have asked my permission first". No shit sherlock! Thanks for ruining my day... felt like crap, got angry, nearly  killed  Kat by throwing my keys at the wall and finally calmed down after going to English (SUCH a relief, couldn't wait to get there) and eating a bar of Galaxy.   My day was further worsened when my purchase of fingerless black+pink gloves from Etam went horribly wrong because they didn't take Solo cards... Next they'll tell me Less Than Jake have split up...  Ceff x   It gets worse before it's all over, I know I'll get through it somehow...
