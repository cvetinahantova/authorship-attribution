well, today is Meiling's birthday. She is Pastor Rupert's wife. I've known her since secondary school when she was my senior in the basketball team. She's realy good and fit then. Now, she's a mother of 2 and time really flies. Anyway, we went out for a fabulous dinner with them and Pastor Tim and sis Joanne. We had seafood! Black pepper crabs, crayfish, sambal fried fish, herbal chicken and stir-fried kailan. Boy, the meal was really great. I just found out too that I've put on 3kg since I got attached to Eileen. A sign of blissful times???hmmm... Anway, to cap things up, we had durians! It was a really good night-out with them. Really have fun. I wondered if I'll have so many friends to be with me when it's my birthday? A sign of being nice to everyone but close to none???
