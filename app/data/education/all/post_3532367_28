Decided to follow up my day off with another one. This will allow me to sort out my new car and get the old one ready for handing back. I went to the local car spares place to find speakers, and air freshener and a rear eye level brake light. I ended up with speaker, air freshener and a 300W amplifier. I just coudn't help myself - not a good start, the first sign of any money and it's gone.
