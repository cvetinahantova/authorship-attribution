The US-lead invasion and occupation of Iraq is illegal  In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal judged that "To initiate a war of aggression  is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime  differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the  accumulated evil of the whole."   Consequently, we demand   An immediate end to the illegal occupation of Iraq by the United States and  the United Kingdom and the immediate withdrawal and removal of all foreign  troops, military advisers and representatives, military equipment and  armaments.   We insist that   The Iraqi people have absolute and sovereign right to determine their own  future and any decision about the need for international assistance rests  solely with the Iraqis.   The United States' and United Kingdom's occupation of Iraq is illegal, as is  any administrative authority or interim government established by the  occupying forces. Therefore, any decisions made by the occupying forces or  their representatives are not binding on the Iraqi people.   The UN-held escrow Iraqi oil account must not be used to foot the bill for  reconstruction of the damage caused by the illegal war and UN sanctions. The  funds must be held in trust for the Iraqi people until there is a legitimate  and genuinely representative government elected by the people.   While we strongly support independent civil society assistance to and  solidarity with the Iraqi people, the United Nations and its agencies, other  governments and non-governmental organisations should not serve as a cover  to legitimise, or profit from, the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Humanitarian aid must not be used to support or promote the military,  political and economic objectives of the occupying forces.   The UN, other governments and NGOs should not use their own resources or  public money to replace humanitarian assistance, aid, reconstruction or  other development activities which are the legal and moral responsibility of  the invading and occupying forces, nor should they characterise as "aid"  that which is the entitlement of the Iraqi people.   The Iraqi people have sovereignty over all natural resources and utilities.  The invading and occupying forces or their private sector proxies have no  right to make any decisions about who controls or benefits from the  exploitation of natural resources or the construction and delivery of basic  services and utilities.   The full costs of all reconstruction, compensation and reparations for the  physical, social, economic, psychological, ecological, cultural and heritage  destruction caused by the US-lead invasion of Iraq must be borne by the  aggressors.   Reparations for the physical, social, economic, psychological, ecological,  cultural and heritage loss, damage and suffering caused by the UN Security  Council mandated sanctions must be borne by the Permanent Members of the UN  Security Council.   In addition, reparations must be paid to all persons who have suffered  physical, economic and psychological loss and trauma resulting from twelve  years of sanctions and the 2003 invasion based on individual and collective  claims and dispensed by an independent compensation tribunal.   We call for   A Peoples War Tribunal based on the Geneva Conventions and Nuremberg  Tribunal principles and precedents to investigate and prosecute the war  crimes of, amongst others, George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney,  Paul Wolfowitz, Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell, Tommy Franks, Tony Blair,  Jack Straw, and John Howard.   International sanctions on the aggressor nations for their illegal,  preemptive attack on a sovereign nation.   The United States Government to desist from threats of force and use of  force against all sovereign nations.
