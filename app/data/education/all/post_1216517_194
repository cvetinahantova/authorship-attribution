ok.  i fear i may have gotten an ameoba.  for those of you that are hip to ameoba records down in LA, this is an entirely different thing altogether.  i met a lacrosse player here and all she talked about were these ameobas.  "ameoba this and ameoba that"  it has kinda freaked me out.  anyways, i don't know how you get them, but they're supposed to make you lazy and stuff, so i think i've had them for quite a while. i went to this bar yesterday.  amazing, the owner was this wonderful piece of work from texas.  he might be the most interesting person i have ever met.  extremely racist and opinionated to the point of: "i want to (sentence deleted)"  i just realized that if i left that last sentence intact i would be put on a government watch list and this guy would be hunted down by the feds, so nevermind, iï¿½ll tell you the story in person.  ask me about it. i've got a script brewing in my mind.  i can feel it.  i'm pretty excited.  it think it might be fun.  in kinda of a 'punch drunk love' sort of way.  oh blessed be this script.  please be good.
