Is there the possibility that there are   NO   evil people trying to sell me porn over pop-ups, and that I really don't need to know about people's threesomes. I am only 15. I really don't need to know about that kind of thing just yet.     Is there the possibility that I will ever make it through GCSEs without having a nervous break-down and ending-up killing myself, but getting it all wrong, and killing someone else, resulting in going to prison. There, I would take up embroidery and send people toothbrush holders made out of lime-green thread with tonnes of naff glitter because prison is too cheap.    Is there the possibility that we could get rid of adverts before watching a film in the cinema, and only putting on the Orange advert: "We are going to make the 4th in the trilogy PAPOW!" "Hahaha. A trilogy is three." "Master, Hobbit left the precious food." "Don't use that voice, it makes me uncomfortable, I've told you that before."               If you haven't realised, that last bit was from the advert with Sean Austin from LOTR, in the Orange advert. It's great, and me and Rachel have much fun in acting it out.
