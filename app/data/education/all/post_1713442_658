urlLink The Graphing Skills of Students in Mathematics and Science Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by S. Asli Ozgun-Koca.  From the ERIC Digest:  The effective use of representations in mathematics and science education has gained more importance as we enter the new millennium. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics even added, Representation, to their four process standards which "highlight ways of acquiring and using content knowledge" (NCTM, 2000, p.29) in their new reform document, "Principles and Standards for School Mathematics". Even though all types of representations are being encouraged in the teaching and learning of mathematics and science, graphical representations play a special role.   Graphs can summarize very complex information or relationship very effectively. Although graphs are explicitly taught in mathematics classrooms as an end in themselves, many subject areas such as science or social studies utilize graphs to represent and interpret relationships. So being able to interpret or construct graphical representations is a crucial skill for every student whether they want to pursue science or mathematics related careers. However, many researchers detected that many students lack graphing skills.   Brasell and Rowe (1993) studied high school physics students' graphing skills and they concluded that "[students] do not understand the fundamental properties and functions of graphs in representing relationships among variables." Their facility with graphs was generally superficial, grounded on a few, simplistic algorithms such as plotting data points" (p. 69). Janvier was one of the first mathematics educators to mention the problems that students have in interpreting graphs (Bell & Janvier, 1981; Janvier, 1981). Mostly he argues how global meanings of graphs and interpreting graphs are left out in mathematics classrooms, while reading data and constructing and reading certain points on graphs are emphasized.
