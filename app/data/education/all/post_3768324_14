First of all, why am I at school at 5:34pm?  I saw a teacher aide (salary hovers around $28,000 a year) driving an Escalade to school today. That's cool, but at the same time, slightly confusing.  Since I didn't post yesterday (out of utter fatigue and exhaustion), I feel the need to come through with some updates today. The "hell kid" (everyone has one) who I was supposed to get didn't show up on the first day... but oh... oh... on the second day, as I stood in the hallway talking to the other third grade teacher, I saw him bounding down the hallway, jumping at every EXIT sign. As my heart skipped 10 beats and my stomach fell about 11 feet southbound, he arrived at my door with a yellow entrance slip and proceeded to behave well for about 10 minutes, followed by being off-task most of the rest of the time. Now, through 2 days - about um, 10 hours total together - he's run over to the computer and signed onto Internet Explorer without permission three (3) times. Man, my life is a joke.  Just so you know, I stop him every time and explain why that's a bad idea, etc... I don't let it happen. But just the sheer incredulty of it happening, right? Or, you know, something.  Last year, I almost never used textbooks as a teaching tool, preferring instead poorly-crafted lessons that accomplished next to nothing. This year, I feel textbooks might be a more structured, fine-tuned approach to student gains. I have two things planned for tomorrow involving textbooks, and one is a magic square activity with single-digit addition. The sheer chances of this working are so SLIM ... naw, I guess I should remain positive on this blog, right?  172 days left.  What's wrong with Team USA Basketball?  When did gymnastics become so captivating?  Why am I more intrigued by preseason football than early pennant chase baseball?  What am I doing at school at 5:45pm?
