Hello Im am writing to share with you some good news. My mom told me that one of my brothers has found God in his life. When I heard the news my face was full of tears of joy. Praise God...He always seem to find the perfect time to show us how much he loves us. As far as me I am still struggling please keep me in prayers. I hope everyone is having a great week.
