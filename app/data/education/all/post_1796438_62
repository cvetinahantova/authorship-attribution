I swear, if for every time I said (or whinged) that I was bore, I got $1, I would be a fucking millionaire (or however the hell you spell it).   I'm tried because I went to a sleepover on the weekend...got to bed at 1:00am and then woke up and 7:30am...zzzzzzzzzzz...*wakes up* what? Oh yeah. We watched "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Underworld" (of which got a teddy thrown at the TV twice care of me because the scientific data was wrong and the ending), "Big Fish" and nearly all of "Welcome to the Jungle"...anyway, overall good night.  Update on work status: I am currently an employee of two companies now. Woolworths (zzz)and HOYTS! (YAYAYAYAYAYAY!). As you can tell, very happy that I got the Hoyts postition. I sat down for 5 hours on Saturday for Woolworths training and another 3 hours tonight...get paid $6.50 (approx) an hour. Hoyts on the other hand, I will get $10.something an hour. So yes, if they clash, I know which one I will be sticking with.  Haven't got a boyfriend...which is such a shame (not)  Got one more level on LOTR to complete before I can play with the secret characters (one of which is Faramir)  Got Drama performance night this Wednesday, followed by a Chem test on Thrusday, followed by my sister's birthday and dancing concert on Friday, followed by Hoyts training on Saturday...and I won't be tried (who the hell am I kidding. I'll have to learn to sleep with my eyes open)  I think I'm getting a cold...*cough cough* I CAN'T AFFORD TO BE SICK!  Anyway, better do some work hey. I'm media and bored out of my mind, but wait! this is what I was talking about in the first place.  Anyway, love ya all (though sometimes one or more of you need a kick up the bum).  BYE!
