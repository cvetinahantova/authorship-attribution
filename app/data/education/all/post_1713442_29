urlLink AntiPlagiarism.com   This is a site selling a book titled  THE PLAGIARISM HANDBOOK: Strategies for Preventing, Detecting, and Dealing with Plagiarism .  I am giving a workshop for CMU faculty on plagiarism this fall.  I am also going to have an entire lecture dedicated to it for my LIB 197 students.  This looks like a good book and I am going to try and get a copy of it.  Regardless, there are some good tips for dealing with plagiarism at the site.  (As students continue to download music with no regard to copyright, I wonder if this influences their beliefs on cutting-and-pasting the words of others into their papers without regard.  These two areas of intellectual property are related I think.)
