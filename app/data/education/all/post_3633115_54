It's almost 5pm and I'm still in my pajamas. Go ahead and hate me, but it's only because I'm doing laundry and have no clean clothes. Okay, well, I do now, but I don't feel like putting them on at this point. Seems silly to me.   I'm also still in my p.j.s because Shorty stayed home from day care today. The poor sleepy child slept until 10AM!!! Geez. Clearly our "vacation" wasn't restful for anyone.
