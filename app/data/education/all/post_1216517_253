though i am sure gloyd will be the most interested, this whole thing is fairly cool. considered among rock circles the best unreleased album ever created, "smile" has recently been finished nearly 40 years after the original recording session in '66   urlLink this article  that i found on msnbc has a fairly glossed over, sort of awed tone to it. there's a fairly interesting  urlLink press release  on the official  urlLink brian wilson  site as well. but it looks like we'll finally get to hear it by the time i am married, because nonesuch is going to release it at the end of september. who knows, maybe with all the music connections floating around here, we might get to hear it earlier than that. i could drink to that...
