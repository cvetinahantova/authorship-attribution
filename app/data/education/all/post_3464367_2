Hello World! I am excited because I woke up this morning and I got another chance at this life.  For those that know me, or know someone like me, things haven't been easy for me lately but I am still here. The amazing thing -- I still manage to smile at least once per day. This blog is dedicated to providing inspiration for those who may have lost hope and bring a smile to your day so that you can enjoy the rest of your life.     I believe that God has given me the purpose to make a positive difference in the lives of others. So take a look at my  urlLink favorite scripture . (By no means do I claim to be perfect, I just want to love my neighbor, one blog at a time.  :)
