just got an email from my dear old friend erin (aileen anne) o'donnell (whinnery) -- though i'm pretty sure she doesn't parentheticalize those parts of her name....erin, i'm just trying to make you recognizable to all those from the good old days...  *if* there is  anyone from the good old days reading.   *AND* if any of you are reading -- the point of this blog is to say -- YES. Lynn and I are trekking back to Cedarville for homecoming this year.  It's an odd year to go for us -- but we're sure that we'll bump into all kinds of good friends...  Right?   Anyone else coming?  urlLink Email  us & say so!  (BTW ~ that "YES" was to Erin's as-yet-unidentified query about whether we would indeed be going to Cedarville for homecoming this year...)
