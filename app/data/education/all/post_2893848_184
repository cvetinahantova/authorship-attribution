Respect my Authority    urlLink Who knew Robots could be assholes too .    Look at that swagger.  (via  urlLink Itchy Robot )  I can't tell if this is serious or not, largely because of the caption at the bottom of the screen and the awkwardly serious note that ends the film.  Still, I smell satire.  I just can't believe there is anyone on this planet who is simultaneously capable of building a robot and not heeding James Cameron's warnings about  urlLink giving   urlLink them   urlLink guns .  Assuming for a moment that this is serious, why is it presented as an option exclusive to the third world?  Because there they don't have the political apparati to prevent it from happening?  Or because of some more nefarious, imperialist agenda is at work?    This seems like an appropriate time to unveil my robot poem.  Some of you are familiar with this poem and I apologize for subjecting you to it again.  Scott:  please show it to your boss and see if you can get me published.   I am afraid of robots, afraid that they will smear my  electric outlets with peanut  butter and cackle new wave when my dog electrocutes herself.  Fucking Robots  Think they’re so smart just because they don’t get hungry.
