So I drove up to Brick last night to see Craig.  It wasn't much.  We drove around Brick for about 45 minutes, and then I went home.  Really cute... sweet... funny... nice... but I'm not sure what he thinks about me.  I guess there's always that uncertainty when you meet someone for the first time, especially under those situations.  Maybe I'm just overreacting.  He was nervous and very tired... so maybe that's what made the first "date" kinda awkward.  He said he'd call today, and I have no doubt that he's telling the truth.  He seems to be a sincere guy.  First day of summer, first day of new job.  I'm only going in to see how to set up, though.  I don't think I'm doing any waitressing.  Hopefully this Delores person will remember I'm coming in and will be there.  LOL  I think that if things are cool between me and Craig, I'm gonna ask him to Melissa Marolla's wedding.  Keep fingers crossed.
