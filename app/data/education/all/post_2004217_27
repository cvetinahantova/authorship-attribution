Well, that's the German done with. That was possibly the hardest homework I've ever done... How Mrs. Dalgleish expects me to get an A I do not know...   But on to the HILARIOUS stuff that happened today, namely... Kat. The lunchtime conversation began fairly innocently, as I was eating my yummy scrummy M&S Deli Filler (Prawn and Mayo)...  "You know... you're not supposed to eat those out the tub, you're supposed to put them on some sort of carbohydrate" "I know that" "Jess... can you eat potatoes?" "No" "Can you eat bread?" "No" "What about rolls?"  *look*  "What about toast? Can you eat toast?"  *sigh* "No..."  The lunchtime progressed, with Kat poking me every SECOND saying "Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess... Can you eat bread/rolls/doughnuts/iced buns/toast/cake/loaves?" And ending up being hilarious... somehow. After asking her politely to cease pokeage and askage of  stoopid  questions many times, I had to resort to threatening to eat Kat with my spoon, at which point boyf (Coz) rang, and she was therefore saved from such an edible end. You just wait til next time... no amount of "meep"ing can stop me and my  HUGE  spoon... Muahahahahahaaaaaaaa!!!! Ahem....  C ya @ da sho (innit) Ceff x
