Well, as you may or may not have already read, I decided to rent a car for 1/2 a day in order to ship stuff home.  Well, after realizing I had accomplished the days tasks and it was now pouring, I was left contemplating how to occupy my time and maximize the use of the car.  On Sunday I learned that unfortunately stephanie has been suffering from a pretty bad cough and cold that won't seem to go away.  She had said that she might skip school (I already had the day off due to a sports competition on sunday I attended)and go to the doctor.  I sent her a mail asking if she in fact stayed home to go to a doctor or if she unwisely went to school.  20 seconds later my phone was ringing.  Due to sleeping in and waking up to the pouring rain, steph had feared that she would have to pay for a cab to and from the doctors.  Lindsey to the rescue I suppose...    After taking Steph to the doctor she then asked what my plans were for the rest of the day.  I told her my only plans were to return the car by 8 and to have dinner with Jemma.  She thought that maybe I would want to go to Rifu-Cho (another city close to mine) to see Harry Potter.  I was interested but didn't want to cancel on Jemma and also had to return the car.  After sending messages to Jemma and driving to Rifu to find out the movie times and stuff, we decided a Harry Potter evening was in order.  Steph called the car place and asked them if we could keep the car until morning, we grabbed some lunch, picked Jemma up from school and then traveled back to Rifu for the movie.  It was quite good I have to admit!   After the movie we had a nice dinner, I drove everyone home, and eventually had the car parked ready to be returned today on my way to school.  It was quite a nice day for something so unplanned!
