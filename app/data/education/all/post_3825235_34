Just my luck!  We washed my car Saturday and what happens?  It rains.  Hard.  Sunday night.  BUMMER!  And I mean mega bummer.  But it's all good, because I know we need it here in the desert.  FYI, we are above the normal rainfall level for today.  YAY!  I guess I should wash my car more often, maybe it would rain more.  :)  It's all good, too, because I was able to go out last night, so I am in much better spirits now that I have had some time to myself, to be an adult.  Just a little pick-me-up for the last 3 weeks of summer.  (School starts in 3 weeks, can you believe it?!?)  You know what that means?  3 weeks until the concert!  YAYAYAYAY!  I am SO stoked!
