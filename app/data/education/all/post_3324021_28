It is now your time to exercise your responsibility and vote. On Tuesday you will be able to hit the polls and vote for your Class and SA Senators (Look out for an easily recognizable name *-*wink*-*) All though these 12 you are able to choose may not have as much power as the officers you elected in April, they still play a vital role in our government's system. The only way we will ever get change, is if we fight for it, if we stand up and vote for change. I want you to vote for change on Tuesday, slowly we will form a better student government!
