Summer... Vacation.....  How exciting.   You know, one of the many plusses of being a teacher, is that you get an extended summer holiday.  I am starting that holiday tomorrow... how is it starting?  I will pack almost everything I own, and move home for the summer.  Apparently I have decided to take a summer job, you know.. because I will need the money.  Um.. in case you weren't sure... that was sarcasm.  I don't actually need the money.  I am trying to convince myself that I will be bored out of my mind, and want something to do.  That is the only way thinking of it makes any sense....  Don't work... or work... when you're getting paid for the summer, it makes perfect sense to just not work.  However.. not exactly what I am doing.  Uh.  I don't have much to talk about really.  I successfully completed the year... I must say that I am slightly sad to be moving home.. I established some wonderful relationships while I was here.. and to leave them.. seems a bit sad.  Low and behold I will be back in August.. to start the whole process over again. Alas.. this is what I prepared myself for.  Thats pretty much it.  I haven't written any scary lame assed poetry lately, nor do I intend to soon....  just for your information.  So.. have a joyous summer.. I am sure I will post more due to my extreme summer boredom.  Until then.... Ciao!
