I was half watching an old episode of  urlLink Buffy  the other night and the character Willow says "I'm very seldom naughty..".  This little phrase has just been floating around in my head for the last couple days.  Today, while talking with my principal, we started discussing one of my students.  Now this girl is a nightmare!  She's the kind of student that drives teacher's crazy.  She doesn't pay attention, she doesn't do her work, she lies to me  all  the time and she occasionally takes things that don't belong to her. And I  like  her, I really like her.    But when my principal and I were talking today, I realized that she is exactly the kind of girl I would have been if I had had the guts.  I would have loved to have blown off my teachers and just read a book hidden in my desk all day. Or snuck candy all day long.  However, with both my parents being teachers, I was very seldom naughty.  And it still describes me today, although I do try to fit a little bit of naughty into my life periodically, just because I now can...  Hence the name change for this blog. ( Was that a really long story just to get that point?)
