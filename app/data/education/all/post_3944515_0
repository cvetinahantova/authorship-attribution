Why... Suddenly felt so moody even though i had finished my ahem le.. Girls suffer from pre-menstrual syndrome.. I guess for me, it's post.. The answer dawned on me after lunch.. He called me yesterday.. Not even a word of "i miss u".. So uncaring and insensitive.. Then again, it's not his fault.. We weren't supposed to be together in the first place.. Or rather, we didn't even start a relationship in the first place.. Love is such a funny thing.. I told you before to go look for someone who can really understand your needs and suit your lifestyle.. I'm not the one for you, given my current situation..  Why are girls so silly.. Willing to do anything for their guys.. I promised myself before to think logically and rationally but then.. I hate it when the mind always cannot agree with how the heart feels.. Haha.. Sorry guys.. Bet you're feeling confused.. It's ok.. I'm one confused gal..   --*--Will time heal all wounds? I don't wish to hurt anyone anymore--*--
