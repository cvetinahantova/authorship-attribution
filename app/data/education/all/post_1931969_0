Greetings.  People say third time's the charm.  Well, I hope they're right since this is the third time i've tried to build this blog.  The first time was ok for about a month and then everything that could go wrong, did in fact go wrong: computers crashing, drives burning, you name it.  the second time, well, it was more of my fault, so I hope this time we'll do better.  I am writing from Patras, Greece and i am interested in all those things (small and big ones) tha make you go "hmmm..."  be back soon.  ikd, 20042805135000
