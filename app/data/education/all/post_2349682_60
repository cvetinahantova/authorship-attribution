I saw the cutest thing in the world today on my way to school. I saw a mother duck with her babies crossing the street. I don't know how they knew that they had the walk sign but they did, and then the daddy was following them. All the little babies were waddling and hopped onto the sidewalk from the street. It was so precious.
