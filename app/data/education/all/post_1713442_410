urlLink Gearing-Up for Career Awareness: Profile of a Middle School Career Program. ERIC/CASS Digest.   This ERIC Digests is by Kathleen Marcos.  It reviews methods that help middle school student begin thinking about careers.  From the ERIC Digest:  Throughout the last decade, researchers have recommended that career exploration and awareness begin before high school, when students have already made major decisions about courses (Castellano et. al, 2002; Fouad, 1995; O'Brien, et. al, 1999; Toepfer Jr., C.F., 1994). In many cases, students passively follow career paths simply by not choosing from their high school classes the courses needed for technical or other careers. To encourage students to make informed decisions, middle schools must introduce career awareness, such as the concept that success in most careers requires education and training (Fouad, 1995). As the National Alliance of Business recommended in its 1999 publication Preparing Young People for Tomorrow's Workplace, "Middle school is an ideal age at which to expose students to the challenging world of work" (p.5).   In their article Broadening Career Horizons for Students in At-Risk Environments, O'Brien et al. (1999) state that "Few middle schools adequately address the career development of students in at-risk environments despite evidence to indicate that interventions can enhance academic performance, facilitate high school completion, and encourage postsecondary education" (p.216). Because students who drop out of high school often begin to disconnect in middle school or earlier, interventions that give the school experience focus and meaning are critical (Castellano et al., 2002).
