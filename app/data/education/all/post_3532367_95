Just managed to get through to Relate. She took my details, then said there was a 45 UKP charge for each session! I told her I couldn't afford that and her manager is going to ring me back to discuss options for reduced payments. Lets hope they can get it down to 10-15 quid or something. I have said she can leave a message if she needs to.
