In a post at  urlLink Boing Boing  Cory Doctorow suggests ways to bypass the registration uglyness that certain sites throw upon the hapless reader.   Further, there is a very nice util/plugin available  urlLink here  that will generate random userids/passwds for registration-mandatory sites, such as the NYTimes.     I tried it and I can tell you I will try it again and again.  I have no grudge against registrations except I cannot remember all my combinations of userids/passwds.  That would lead me to recycle a set of userid/passwd and some where along the line lose it with all the consequences that may come with such a loss. I have no problem clicking on a button, but I have no desire to enter a zillion details (that's personal information, I might add) about jobs, employment, salaries etc.  Keep the web free. That was the original idea, that is still the idea.  Keep news and information free.  The alternative is ... well, read Caleb Carr's "Killing Time" and you will understand.  Ioannis, 20040721142000
