I'm sure I'm going to get some flack for this, assuming of course, that anyone ever reads it, but I'm tired of dealing with wishy-washy liberals. All day long, I listen to co-workers and teachers blather on about how wretched President Bush is, but if I even think about uttering a harsh word about Kerry or (God forbid) Bill Clinton, I'll be run out of higher education on a rail.   I happen to  like  President Bush. I happen to want a president who thinks to pray before he makes a major decision. I actually don't agree with turning our great nation into a welfare state full of happily married gay people. (Look at the plumbing here folks, no matter how hard you try you can't make two male adaptors fit together.) As I watched the week long tribute to President Reagan, I remembered just how great he was for our nation. Jimmy Carter, a nice man but a horrid president, was all doom and gloom. His speeches were about as uplifting as a spinal tap, and the nation was basically down in the dumps. Reagan came along and gave us national pride. To this day I am not ashamed to fly a flag, and that is due directly to Ronnie. In Europe, I carried a backpack with an American flag nametag on it. Several folks gave me dirty stares, but I didn't mind. I'm proud to be American, damn it, and I think that is how it should be. Period. Now we face the summer long Clinton love fest--my barf bag is at the ready.   I plan on ranting like this often. Republicans, we need to go on a scavenger hunt for our spines, and I'll be the one reading the map.
