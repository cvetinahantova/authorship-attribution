Music:  Veridis Quo - Daft Punk  Mood:  too tired to sleep!  *************************************   Blah, I just got done watching 'Grace Under Fire'... doom...  I just smoked about half a pack of cigarettes... -.-... now I'm buzzed... and it's sad because they were Ultra-lights... but that's all my mom smokes! So, that's all I can get my hands on! Lucky me, I get old woman cigarettes...!  I hate trying to loose weight... I'm trying to get thin so I can wear all sorts of gothic clothes without having to look like a fucking retard... right now I wear baggy clothes and stuff... I hate all those fat girls who wear all the tight gothic clothes...! It's gross... and annoying... because only the skinny goths should be allowed to wear the tight nylon pants... >.>...!!!   I think I've been really pissed off lately because I stopped smoking pot... I quit because it turned me into one of those annoying skater kids... >.>... oh how I despise that...! All those skater kids are annoying, and now that it's summer, I don't have to be in the same room with them! I was ignoring all my cool otaku gothic friends to go... ugg... skateboard!!  TO FUCKING SKATEBOARD!! WHAT THE FUCK!?!? I actually let dust form over my anime collection!! I PACKED AWAY MY NEWTYPES AND GOTHIC BEAUTY MAGAZINES!!  I fell into a deep hole of despair that is something that I've despised ever since I hit the 7th grade...!! I would skip skool to go get high... it was terrible... but I'm back to my old self... and I'm glad... my friends are glad I'm back... and I've been apologizing for my 'drifting'...!! I also stopped because I'm trying to get a job...! Barnes and Noble here I come! w00t!  Right now I'm trying to convince Evans (a kid who I've known ever since he was born, and our mom's were/are friends since they were both 13!)to become a raver kid... he's one of those pot head/skater dorks... >.>... it sickens me, because I made him that way... but I think since I'm his role model, he'll follow me... he went from anime lover/goth apprentice to skater kid like I used to be... >.>... it's sad... truly is... I'm still disgusted with my self... that I could cause such a thing to happen!! It's all the  fucking 'Jones' bitch's fault !! I make one common ground that we both like Korn/Marilyn Manson/Slipknot music, and I have to go hang out with her!! ... >.>... I'm so  naive ...!!   *AHEM*  On a happy note! We are in the process of selling our house...! And it's accutally quite fun! I like to be sitting up in my room (my bleek, boring room... my mom made me take down all my posters and such... eh, whatever works)and play with my tarot cards with my death techno playing and Vampire Hunter D playing on my TV...! It's quite funny to see the preppy teens walk around upstairs then walk into my room to see me, this dark goth girl playing with tarot cards... their faces are pricless...!!  DAMMIT!!  I need to wash my hair tomorrow...  STUPID FUCKNIG SUMMER!! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU SO MUCH!  It's hot and humid and my hair gets all frizzy and flaky... -.-#  CURSE YOU!!   I'm off to bed... love all!    urlLink
