3. Yes, it is true that the traditional classroom setting may be considered ineffective today, since the teacher is like the "leader" and the students the "followers".  The teacher gives the knowledge and the students remain quiet unless told to recite.  Opinions are rarely honored in that setup, and students are forced to only visualize and imagine the meaning of the lessons.    Incorporating educational technology in the traditional classroom setting may be quite difficult.  The teacher and the students should be treated as equal, sharing knowledge and opinions regarding the lesson.  Cooperative learning, with demonstration and simulation, should complement educational technology to make the learner, regardless of age, further understand the lessons and experience the true essence of learning.    6. Increased communication between home and school will enable the teachers to contact the students or leave a message about the lessons to study and homework they will do, which may be passed via their network.  Parents can also track their children's progress in school by calling the teachers concerned.  Other multemedia instructional materials maybe relayed to the students via their TV or PC at home, increasing their time and eagerness to study and learn.    The home, in fact, is one of the best places to study.  While the school is the center for acquiring knowledge, the home is the center for further application and sharpening of that acquired knowledge.  With a more manageable budget than the school, the family can purchase a computer and all the necessary educational software for their studying children, allowing them to further expand their knowledge and imagination.
