I was happy last night to be able to talk to Josh Hall. And then I was disappointed to see that he was leaving, but it's all well and good and he'll be back Monday. I've been trying so hard to get people together just one time. Emailing...calling...talking to them on the internet.... Just I want to hang around with everyone. But I am having some troubles because I don't know what all of you are up to or if you really want to get together in the first place. So... if possible, it'd be nice if people start posting like each week, what their week is gonna be like. Do it on a Monday. And anything you know about that would keep you from going somewhere can show up here in the Cafe. It'd make doing stuff real easy. Izzy's comin home. You all know that and she'll be joining up. Anyways, later.   Note: Today's not Monday so if you want to post what's happening from now to the weekend that's cool!!> ;-)
