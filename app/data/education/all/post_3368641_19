I am in one taste on the first real day of spring when the sun  greets you like a lover and ceases mocking and holding back its embrace  when the long hibernation is over I venture out to explore the same surroundings but with the new sensual discourse of a babe  there is a long outbreath that is released and a smile spreads face wide as hope is sprung in the annual rituals of life and limb  knowing the frigid short days of winter are never more  than a stone's throw away I must commit to my memory every moment  of this grace  as I get older the first signs of spring have a deeper meaning I need this I need the promise of longer and more hopeful new beginnings   Â©2003 DC Vision
