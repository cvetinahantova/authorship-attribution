I need to find God. He needs to be willing to communicate with me and give me an answer to my question. How can I find God? I need to search for evidence of God. I need to find out how I can communicate with God. This needs to be reasonable, though. So where can I find out about a being who has knowledge of everything? I cannot perceive such a being as far as I know. So my senses are no good here unless God chooses to speak to me through an unnatural or unusual manipulation of my ordinary experience. So unless something rather strange and out of the ordinary happens, I will have to ask others or God directly. I have to assume though, that God would be willing to listen and would be willing to respond to my candid attempt at interaction. If I do not hear from God, I am left having to rely on others. This is not ideal, as they may be misinformed. Again though, there is little to lose so this seems OK.
