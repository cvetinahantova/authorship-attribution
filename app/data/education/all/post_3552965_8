The topic of asylum seekers came up over dinner tonight and (surprise, surprise), it prompted something of a family row.  'Row' is a bit strong, although there were raised voices and I did try to stay calm and not be the snotty graduate who comes home only to behave in a condescending fashion towards her working class parents.  Mum and Dad both say that they're not racists and neither are the BNP. 'I agree with a lot of their ideas,' Mum remarked, 'It's just that we've left it too late to put them into practice.'  I tried to argue that many of the thousands of asylum seekers in this country are fleeing political persection or economic hardship but this cut little ice with either of my parents who still seem to want to treat these foreigners as scapegoats for the ills of both the town and the country.  'They get preferential treatment: council houses, free mobile phones, even bloody massages!' Dad growled.  It saddens me that Mum and Dad feel this way.  I don't feel angry; I just find it depressing that people close to me can be so narrow-minded and can think that individualism is okay. 'You've got to look out for number one you know Lizzie.  It's dog eat dog in this world.'  But that's how wars start, I want to say and I know that I sound like a wishy-washy Guardian reading liberal and I still think I'm right.  I wish I had more concrete answers.  I know that Yarmouth has changed a lot in the past few years; if the figure that Dad quoted is correct and there are 4,000 refugees being housed in the town, then that would mean the population has increased by 10%.  Hmm.  I resolve to find out more about this.  I refuse to believe that Mum and Dad are right and that asylum seekers are the root cause of all of Britain's current social problems. Hmm. Resolve to find out more about this.
