Hello Good morning to all of you. This weekend was very exciting for me because I had a lot of time to hear the Lord's word. Friday I met with one of my friend from school at Starbucks. Her name is Lissette and we were just talking about how our lives have been changed for the better because of Jesus in our life. It was a good time of fellowship she invited me to go with her to a conference the next day Saturday. I was a little anxious not knowing what to expect but I hoped to find the Lord and hear what he had to say to me and I decided to go. This conference that I went to was called the "she conference." What this conference is about is a series of conferences in which they take proverbs 31 which talks about the ideal wife and takes the principles from that verse and makes it applicable to use in the 21st century. The verse we went over was 15 it was about rising while it is still dawn and she prepares food for her servants. The gave us various examples of how to take that verse and apply it to our daily lives. The rising up while is still dim meant that we are the light  guiding us through Jesus Christ and we must spread it to those around us we must nourish those around us with the word of God. They also stressed how we should be driven by God and our only purpose in life is to serve, know him and glorify our savior and creator in all the days of our life. The Conference was great and the speaker was real and very motivating. Sunday I went to church and that was good too. My boyfriend and I also had some time together and we went over some friends house to have dinner that was a good time of fellowship. I thank God for this weekend and for his limitless blessings. Prayer request: Please pray for my relationship w/ the lord and with Sergio, I pray for God's hand of healing for Sergio's brother, for his ministry and I pray for both our families. Thank You Jesus I love you
