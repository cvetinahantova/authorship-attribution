Well, I’m back in Seattle. And, what else is there to say, but that the trip was amazing. Not in the super-spiritual sense, or in an uber-Zionistic meaning. But in the simple fact that it all went smoothly, that the people were fantastic, and that everything matched my expectations. It helped that I was tempering my expectations, but I knew that if I didn’t, the trip, the country, my vision of Israel and Judaism in general could have been knocked down or elevated beyond the rational. And I just wasn’t in the mood for either one. So, I keep everything on the level, and had amazing time.   I have a ton of writing I feel like I should do, but with me leaving for Idaho and the river float trip tomorrow, I’m running the risk of not getting it all done. But that leads to the larger question I face regarding this blog and journaling in general: do I want to write about my life, or live it? Thoughts are defiantly welcomed.
