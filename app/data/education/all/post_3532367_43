Sunday morning started well too, lovely sunny day and we all went out together as a family. After lunch, I asked Sandra if we should test drive one of the Clio's I had seen from the day before. She agreed and off we all trooped. The first one was a diesel - nice car but the salesman was well dodgy and rude to Sandra so we bunked off - after he had given me figures that were 10 UKP a month higher than what he had quoted the day before. We went along to another dealership. They didn't have a diesel, but did have 5 years interest free. The only problem is the deposit was 2345 and 99 pounds a month. Sandra and I discussed it and surprisingly she said we could afford it, so we signed up.
