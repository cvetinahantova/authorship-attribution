With the support of NPR's "Justice Talking," a very lively debate, filled with the sort of forthright speaking, intelligence, passion, and humor that have been chased out of the presidential and vice presidential debates by the corporate-funded, two party-ruled "debate commission," took place today between Howard Dean and Ralph Nader. The debate is now available as an audio archive at the  urlLink Justice Talking website .
