something is wrong with me, what... why do i feel empty, why do i feel like i did before... this is different, i cant accomplish anything at all, not even sleep. i almost broke, it was right there... i dont know what wouldve happened if i had, i didnt want to be there. i didnt remember, i had nothing, my chest wants to burst. i want to close my eyes and never have to open them again... why do these things always seem to be the trigger, i dont know what to do. i dont want to be. do i deserve it, i cant hardly breath anymore. i feel like ripping out my lungs, do they deserve the air... this isnt helping any at all, what am i supposed to do... do i dare, i made the promise already... what have i done to deserve this... nothing, nothing at all. i shouldnt have any of anything... i need to be alone in the cold. i want to be alone in the cold. i just want solitude and a frozen mind.
