The alarm went off at 05:30 - I had already been awake for over 30 mins. I got ready to go after Sandra had threatened me "don't you dare waste my brothers money, by not going". Sandra had said that "they ware going between 06:00 and 06:15" and that I "should take my rucksack to help carry the food and drinks."  I drove over to my FIL's house - no car, but it was only 06:10 - where were they? 5 mins later I had a call on my mobile.   "Where are you?"  "I'm at your house." "What you doing there I said I would pick you up at 06:15 from yours." "Sorry, thats not the message I got, there was no suggestion you would be picking me up." "Stay there, I'll come and get you."  Great, here I was in the wrong place...fantastic! The traffic would be shit, everyone would be late and miss the practise session, possibly qualifying as well and I would get the blame for not following instructions. Why couldn't Sandra have told me or been clearer? I looked up at the window of the house, my MIL was there and she mouthed "you pratt....you pratt" at me. My heart sunk even further, I couldn't take much more of this. It was all I could do not to cry.  The journey there was in virtual silence, Simon tried to dispell any atmosphere by saying it was history and to forget it, but I still felt burdened. Fortunately, though the traffic was light, we arrived in plenty of time having gone a different way - I was washed by a wave of relief and the day picked up as the racing began.
