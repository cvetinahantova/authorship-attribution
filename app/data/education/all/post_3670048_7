I went to the cabin yesterday, but only for a night.  My family has a house near Lake Arrowhead, Ca.  We were lucky that it didn't burn down in last October's fires, though I have to tell ya we came pretty darn close!!  The fire burnt till about 3 doors down on both sides, we were in the curve of an "S" shaped street, and there were about 5 houses all together that were spared.  This house, a simple A frame that my grandfather built in the 1960's has been a vacation spot for my family since my father was a teenager.  I love it up there!! It's beautiful and clear and wreaks havoc on my allergies!! But it's great!  Other than that I met with my master teacher yesterday morning.  His  name is Brian (same as my brother and my cousin!) and he seems pretty nice, I don't think he's all that older than me, but who knows.  He's the History Dept chair at Parkman MS and usually teaches 8th grade history (US) which is frankly a lot more fun than 7th grade.  The course is only 6 weeks and will focus primarily on Exploration of the New World, early American civilizations (Inca, Maya, Aztec) and the Conquistadors.  Unfortunatly I know NOTHING about any of these subjects!! PLEASE IF ANYONE OUT THERE IS READING THIS PLEASE HELP!!!! I need info and lesson plan ideas!!! ACHHHHH!!
