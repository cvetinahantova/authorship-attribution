the sun is fiercely trying and only barely succeeding at warming the day, but if i just stare out my office window -- the blue sky makes me happy.   maybe we're all getting that sun - deprivation disease.  as a species, you know, humans. everybody. or maybe it just happens when we get old. which, i know, i am getting.  ...............  what makes me happy right now:   1. reading plays.  writing plays.   2. sunshine.  3. leaving work.   4. staying home.  5. walks in the chilly air.  6.  the hmmmm of airplanes flying over and that rush of -- "i'm going somewhere" adreniline in my stomach.  even though i'm not really going anywhere.  7.  sam smith beers.  8.  the whistling song in Kill Bill 1.  9. afternoons at Harry and Laurie's  10.  Listening to Lynn tell stories or talk to big groups of people when she's excited.  11.  jaelyn's smile.  12. addison's protesting, "but how we Ever, Ever going to ...(fill in the blank here)."  13. the house on 23rd street.  no, really, its just the enormous hope and possibility of the house on 23rd street.  .....................  what doesn't make me happy right now:   1. the fact that every time I glance up at the sunshine above my desk, more papers copulate and have babies and the piles get thicker and messier.  longer to-do lists.  2. you can never go home.  ..............  what else makes me happy:   the increasing prevalence of orange in our culture.  i'll be sad when this phase is over.  the birth of malachi  keegan (sp?) to my friends...  .........  when i first had (both of my) babies.  i lay awake with them in a bassinet next to my bed listening for their breath. its hard to hear baby breath.  i thought.  maybe i'll never sleep again.  but if i can keep this baby alive...it'll be worth it.  how will i ever keep this ridiculously fragile baby alive?   .........  other things that make me happy.  1. small boxes.  2. coffee.   ................  what's great about wes anderson movies?   - the characters are horribly depraved and the relationships are so completely broken, but there's so much hope.  so much love.    ...............  maybe shutting up every once in a while on your blog makes people stop checking. and you can stop thinking about who you're righting for and start writing for yourself again.  maybe.  ...............  peace~   (and love and hope.)
