Wah.. I'm down with flu.. Weather has been really funny these few days.. One moment it's raining, the next it's sunny.. Can't believe i've been living in Singapore for the past 16 years of my life and i'm still not used to this weather.. Hmm.. Could feel the pressure already.. So many projects and the dateline is like 3 weeks away?.. My group has been really really cooperative.. They're willing to stay back in school even though lessons end around 4 pm.. I'm so touched by their dedication.. *crying*.. Hey, i mean it k.. Thanks Deny, Laywei, and Daryl.. Owe you one guys..
