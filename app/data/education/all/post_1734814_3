Drew at basketball last night. Should have won, lost it the last four seconds. Really hate that, especially as i think i'm partly to blame. Such is life.  Wandered onto the online church again the other night, actually got in as a real worshipper for once, not just a ghost. Down in the crypt, had someone who was moronic enough to call himself Adolf Hitler. Wasn't interested in talking to anybody, just wantde to shout abuse about Jesus, how he was a Roman creation who never really existed, could come up with any valid arguments ,just wanted to mouth off....oh yeah, and whisper "queer" or "religion is for the weak minded" to everybody. Pointless really. If you get your jollies out of entering Christian chat rooms and abusing them without intent of rational argument, you need to get out more. Suppose it made him feel better though.  Saw Van Helsing last week. Pretty crap really. Lets distort the original VH character and turn into some kind of semi immortal superhero with all sorts of bizarre mystical plot lines and a host of "monsters" from literary creations throughout history and lpace them together. Stretch the plot so thin that it's not only transparent, but you forget you're looking through it, and fill it in with some amazing transitional SFX. Note to Hollywood - Special effcts do not a blockbuster make. That said, they were one of the few redeeming features in the movie, along with david wenham's "Q" type friar character. Jackman was OK, so was Beckinsale, but neither had any real depth of character to work with.
