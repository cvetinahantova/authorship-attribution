YOU WERE BORN A  few weeks later. I cut the cord. Did my mother tell you that? I was the one that cut the cord. You were a quiet baby. I remember the two boys and Mia when they were babies, they were not as quiet. [E]specially Paolo; he used to cry all night. I used to think he must have had the biggest pair of lungs. But you were quiet, as if you knew Mama could not take any more.  I used to come and watch you so Mama could have a rest, or go to church--she went to pray often in those days. I used to hum to you as I carried you but you would not remember that. All those times that I was up in the room with you, Mama could have spoken to me but she did not.  Mama kept many things to herself, maybe because she did not want us to worry. All I remember is that Tia Thelma came often. Mama needed her in those days. But she should have told me. I was the eldest. She should have let me know. But she kept me in the dark about how bad things were. I did not know until I came home found the piano gone.  You know how some things are more than what they are. Like I look at this ring here to me it is more than just a ring. It is my marriage. And if I were to lose it I would think it a bad sign. I never take this ring off. Never. It was like that with the piano. I still remember the day that it was given to me.  I was five that day.
