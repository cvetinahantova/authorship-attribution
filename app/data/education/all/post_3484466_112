I think I'll take advantage of my current state and make it into a science experiment. First Experiment: Sleeping Upright I hypothesize, of course, that there's no way in hell I'm going to pull it off, unless I'm in the shower. But I've already taken a shower this morning, and I'm not about to take another one in the name of useless science. Anyway, I'm too tired to stand up, so we'll skip to the next one. Second Experiment: Chair Sleeping I've actually been trying this off and on for the past hour, and I don't believe it's possible to get into any position at all in this chair where I can sleep. I will continue to attempt this one for a while, and fill in the details later. Third Experiment: Caffeine I'll throw this in later when I really start to fall apart. We'll see just how much a little caffeine boost helps out.  Anyway, you can now begin eagerly awaiting the results of said experiments. I'm sure you're on the edge of your seat.
