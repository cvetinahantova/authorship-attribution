I was also surprised to see that Rogers mentions that self-efficacy predicts early adoption.  I will have to take a closer look at this literature.  Self-efficacy always brings up the question, with respect to what domain?  We used a measure called proactive coping -- there are a lot of different types of self-efficacy and this particular scale reminded me of some of our successful seniors.  There's only one problem: in our survey, adopters reported slightly (but significantly) lower proactive coping scores (if I read the logistic regression results correctly).  Everything else looks fine.  Age is negatively related to adoption.  Education is positively related to adoption. Technology optimism is related positively to adoption. And proactive coping is related -- negatively -- to adoption.  Technology discomfort does not predict non-adoption until you remove the group from the analysis that didn't self-adopt (someone else set up the connection for them).  Perhaps what we have here is an order effect.  The proactive coping scale came after scales where we asked adopters about their internet use and attitudes.  I wished perhaps that the curiosity scale items had come first now.  I'd like to have another theory though for why this happened.  Maybe non-adopters coped effectively with the internet using the simplest most direct method....they didn't adopt!
