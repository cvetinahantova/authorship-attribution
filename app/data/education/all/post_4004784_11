Hey guys,  I am really looking forward to the HC mini-reunion this weekend!! Thanks so much to Caddie, Dee, Donna, and Krissy for organizing it!  I was thinking about how blogs seem to be popping up everywhere. I was also thinking about how much I was looking forward to seeing everyone this weekend and how it's a shame that it gets so difficult to keep track of everyone and to catch up with everyone. Sooooo, I thought that creating a team blog where we can all post anything and everything we want seemed like a great idea.   I hope you guys agree!  Sign up and have some fun!  You can post pictures and everything here too!  ~Caitlin
