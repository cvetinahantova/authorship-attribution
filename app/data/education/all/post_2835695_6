The words you use in talk and composition can reveal your laguage ability. Despite if it has significance, the accuracy is another factor to be observed.  One day, I told my friend, who is an American, that I picked up a new vocabulary word  chichi  having close meaning with affectation when I consulted a dictionary about the subtle differences between mystique and mystery. All of a sudden, doubts deluged him. He responded, "Chichi is a real word, but it's usually colloquial. It also sounds kind of gay (the sort of thing gay people would say) so you have to be careful how you use it. People usually use it ironically. If your essay is in formal English, you should probably avoid it. If you are writing more colloquially, it's okay." So, the next time you talk or write something, try to craft your words or it might cause enormous understanding or doubts.
