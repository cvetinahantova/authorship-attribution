VAGABONDAGE  I am lonely and yet want to be left alone I am poor and yet all my needs are met  I am in a hurry but have found peace in going nowhere I am not up I am not down I just am  I grew tired of sojourning, when I finally realized that all of my discoveries  were found within fleeting truths are the only secrets contained in the lines of unfolded maps  I found the end of the rainbow after decades of seeking there was no pot of gold there was nothing and nothing means everything to me today  Â©2003 DC Vision
