The title track from Fiona Apple's new CD has leaked. I am not sure what the legalities are so I am justy posting a link to the  urlLink Velvet Rope thread  that has the link at the top.  Warning: it's totally different from her other work - it's very Broadway. Rolling Stone calls the song a  "Tin Pan Alley-esque blend of Tom Waits and Vaudeville."  Sony has decided not to release the CD despite the fact she is one of their most serious artists (Jon Brion, the producer, talks about it  urlLink here ). Sony SUCKS and they should remember the Wilco story.   I hope the record isn't all like this, but it is a fun song and has the usual Fiona linguistic play on the lyrics.
