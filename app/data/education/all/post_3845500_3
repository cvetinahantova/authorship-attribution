I know I may only just have got back, but I am thinking about where I will be going for my next holiday, and I intend to take it before the end of the year.  Mixing overtime and what I will accrue during this holiday year, I will have enough to take four weeks off, and have been tossing the ideas of either Nepal or the Patagonian region of Chile and Argentina around.  I would love to go to Nepal, and part of me wants to go there even at the moment to see the country in turmoil, but I would also love to go back to South America and this time it has won.  I have a meeting in the US in early November, so I plan to go to that, then head straight down to Buenos Aires, spend four weeks in Argentina and Chile, then come back to the UK.  Time to dust off my Lonely Planet "Latin-American Phrasebook."
