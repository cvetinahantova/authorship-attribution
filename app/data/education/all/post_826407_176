just to be clear.  That's Pomo, not Porno in my profile - I've been getting the virtual equivalent of strange looks.  So let me explain.  Pomo is shorthand for  urlLink Postmodern .  The longer word in annoying, clumsy and heaped with different ideas and interpretations.  The shorter is just the same, but hopefully just a little more playful.  I identify myself as a Pomo Pilgrim because it seems like an appropriate statement of intent.  Postmodern is what I am and where I come from.  A lot of what we accept as Christianity has been drafted within an old cultural context best known as Modernism.  That means that at best some of it isn't too useful and at worst it is idolatrous.  It also means that the label Christian means lots of things to lots of people, and not all of them are the most helpful.  I choose to identify myself as postmodern to show that I am eager to seek Christ in our new cultural context. I call myself a pilgrim because I am on a journey.  I am travelling towards Christ.  This blog is mainly to tell chapters of that story.  I hope that makes sense.  I know it all sounds pretentious, thats the problem with paradigm shifts! ;-)
