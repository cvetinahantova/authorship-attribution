Marshall is a very smart guy, but I think he somewhat misses the point. On the one hand, there is a great criticism of Keyes to be made in this context--despite the fact that Obama is quite liberal, he may end up looking like the very soul of moderation next to Keyes. But the real point is that Keyes is a powerful, destructive force, one who (as Marshall rightly points out) as often as not gets his force directed back at himself--but Keyes doesn't need to "win" the debates, or even come off looking better than Obama in a comparative sense, to serve his purpose. All he needs to do is to force Obama to be sufficiently explicit about his actual (liberal) positions to prevent him from seeming all things to all people.
