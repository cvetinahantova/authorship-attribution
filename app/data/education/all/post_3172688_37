Hey... I just got home from my walk, but nothing really interesting came to mind while I was walking except for one thing; on here (my last post) I only put mom as a reason why I was confused, but the truth is, it wasn't only her... It was my sister doing another one of her 'I'm better than you so when you talk to me, I'm going to treat you like crap' trips. Mom just came up because she started me in the bad mood last night, but it was actually my sister who made me the angriest. But anyways, thatâ€™s all I'm going to put for now because I have a huge headache and I want to lay down... So Bye...
