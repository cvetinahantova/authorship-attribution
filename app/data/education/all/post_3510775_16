You realize that the one you love very much isn't for you.  You walk the brink and you learn to fly, you break free of your Self, you break free of your awful past, you see a new Light. Salsa dancing.  Who knew you could dance so well, Casanova? Melding of minds, tippy-tap go the dance steps.  Better than you imagined.  And when you let loose, nothing but Sky raining down on Earth.  As it should be. I am all men.  As it will ever be. All mankind from these loins.  As it ever was. We saw it coming.  Nothing: kissing bliss and a shy raccoon.  Life is renewed.  Reconciliation without penance.  Night.
