Today I realized two things that don't necessarily make my life any easier, just a tiny bit less complicated.   1. I am just now entering the mourning stage for the relationship that ended in February.  This really hit home this afternoon when me & Heather and her new girl were watching Harry Potter and they were cuddling and holding hands and stuff. I found it quite difficult to handle.   2. A corollary to #1: I am no longer the most important person in anyone (that being Heather)'s life. That hit home last night when we were talking and she no longer was willing to make plans around me and my schedule.   Knowing the truth does make things a lot less complex. It doesn't mean I don't hurt, but it does mean that I can move forward from here. What I find odd is that Heather went through this mourning stage way back in Feb, when I felt pretty much numb. It's strange that all of a sudden, 5 months later, I feel a twinge of regret.
