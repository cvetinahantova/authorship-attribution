Hey! Right now I am at school...Like always, but still.  My friendship with my best friend is over :(, so I am unhappy about that. But I guess it is all good, a lot of people just tell me that it is 'just a High School thing' and that we will eventually continue being friends after I stop being mad at her. I don't know though, I mean we are talking and everything, it's just that I don't trust her and I don't consider her as one of my good friends anymore. It just that she keeps putting her boyfriend before me. I'm not the type of person that would really care if one of my friends has a boyfriend, but it is when they think a relationship that doesn't have the potential to last is more important than a friendship that was so strong that we were never seen apart from one another. Anyways, I have been doing good with my boyfriend, I guess. He seems to follow me around like a little puppy =/. Do all younger men do that?? He is nice though, and I like him. But I am used to the mature older guys, not the immature younger guys so I feel a little uncomfortable at times in the relationship. Anyways I have to go present a Power-Point presentation so I will talk to you later... Bye!
