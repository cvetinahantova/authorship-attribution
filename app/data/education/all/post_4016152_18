I am about halfway through my vacation right now.  Seattle was EXCELLENT!!  I took lots of pictures with my palm pilot (Zire 71), which I will post when I get back to NYC.  I am at my mom's house right now on her dialup connection, so until I am back to a faster line, I am not going to post all the details of my trip.   Tomorrow I am heading to the Boise/Caldwell area.  I think that I will be there until Wednesday night, but everything is loosely scheduled as long as I make my flight out of SLC on Saturday.  Again, anyone in the area who wants to get together, let me know.  I want to try to make sure that I see as many people as possible.  I miss everyone very much.   Ok, that's all for now.  Time for laundry.
