Horrid weather, horrid day, horrid person. I came to school cold but chirpy this morning, you know, last day of term, giving presents out, getting presents back, having a dance around the form room and playing silly games with my mates. I really wanted to give Sel her pressie because I knew she'd like it and I couldn't wait to get my new underwear off Debbs. Problem number one: Sel decided she didn't want to come to school today. We rang her at home at about 9.45am and she'd just woken up and "wasn't feeling very well". We eventually managed to persuade her to come in, and when I finally got to give her her present she came across as quite ungrateful. "You did get me extra small, didn't you?" Me: "No I got you small to medium, sorry, do you want the receipt so you can take them back?" "Yeah look I need extra small, they're the right ones and the right colour, but they're too long. Give me the receipt and I'll take them back and change them."  No "Thanks anyway" or "Sorry, I should have told you to get me that size"- I found it really abrupt and it got me down a bit. She's supposed to be my best friend, for God's sake, and I felt really distant from her. She went home at about 11.30am.  After school finished at 1pm (woohoo!) Helen and I passed Owen Ingram tied to a lamppost outside school and went to the Wharf bar for a drink, then we both went to our respective workplaces. I discover that both times I'm in work next week I will be unpaid! Not a happy bunny. I've now worked out that I have only taken 4 hours over my allowed leave time, which I have already made up, plus 2 and a half hours extra. Fair enough, don't pay me for the time I'm not there, but not paying me for the time I am there? Not on at all, especially when I'm having to cut short my Christmas jaunt to Barnsley to come back and work in that hellhole for 10 hours straight. The bastards should be paying me extra, if anything.   Ceff x   Coming down, the world turned over; angels fall without you there...
