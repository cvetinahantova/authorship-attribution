Anxiety seems to have been boring a hole into me of late.  I guess the problem is this.  I want to do something good.  I don't want to let people down - and I worry that I do.  I wish I just didn't care what people thought.  That I could say forget it and get on with my own thing.  But I do and so I worry and it seems to stop me from doing the things I want to.  I guess I need to stop trying to prove myself and remember that, whatever, I'm loved.
