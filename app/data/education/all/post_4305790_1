The birds in Singapore is disappearing faster than a speeding bullet. Who else but a professor would notice a speed like that? An NUS professor, along with several colleagues from Down Under, published a documentation about the state of mammals, birds, fish and butterflies on the island.  It's great that we know this. So what are you going to do? If you are the professor, apparently the wisest thing to do is publish a book on the plight of birds and animals in the region. I'm impatient. We wrote so much about the dinosaurs and look where they are now, extinct!  So let's shout a battle cry. Please suggest any effort we can make to the relevant authorities to save the poor animals. Better yet, think about something yourself and do it. Just don't make an endangered animal a pet. You might be sued for that.  Full article on Singapore's Birdman  here
