The budget problem here in California is affecting our school. All of the schools have been expected to make huge budget cuts to make up for lost funding. That trickles down to us, even though we are a non-public school. Most of our referrals come from the local school districts. Trust me, the cost for educating these emotionally disturbed youth is great; the amount of resources is also.    So, students who might otherwise be referred to our school for the specialized services we provide, and most of the kids really need, are having to stay in the lower level classes within systems that are not designed, or able, to handle these kids unique needs. Unfortunately this creates, in some cases, an extreme drain on the teacher, staff, students, and schools that these kids are being served at. The only positive is that the school district is saving money. But that is actually negatated by the budget shortage.   A lot of these kids you don't want to be in school with your "normal" kids.
