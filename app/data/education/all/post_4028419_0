Wanna know something funny? Whenever I'm in my "feeling lonely" mood and driving in my car, I can't stand to wasn't bad at all! I don't know what things may be looking like for me in the future, but I alisten to anything but the dumb songs that make no sense like "White-Tee" and "Get Low" and the other crazy, but popular songs. I don't know, I guess I just feel like the DUMBNESS of these songs has GOT to lift my mood;) At least I don't focus on what was bothering me in the first place-something about hearing "till the sweat drops down...etc." that makes me forget my troubles at least momentarily-lol.  Yesterday wasn't bad...m blessed with the ability to grab onto those days where the sun seems to be shining just a bit brighter for me and hold those days closer to me than the rest. Some people in my depressive state only harp on the bad days and that's what draws them into their depression even more. But that's why I think I'll eventually win out: I can recognize the blessing of a beautiful day and it, at least for the time being, eclipses all of the bad ones that seemed to haunt me previously.  All I have is this life. That's all any of us have--at least that we know of. So I am trying my best to spend it loving and/or being loved. So even though I may feel the absence of the romantic love that I know I deserve right now, I feel like I can at least make someone ELSE'S day good by letting them know how much I love them.     It's funny because I can always see everyone else's life SOOOOOO clearly.  I mean I can straight "Dr. Phil" them to death! But when it come s to me, I'm just freakin' "Jerry Springer"--LOL:)  That's why I need to hurry up and publish one of my books--so I can read my own advice through my characters.  Well, like I said, yesterday-last night- was a  good  one. I hope there are many more to come. If there aren't, I guess I can brace myself for that. If there are, I'll be ready.
