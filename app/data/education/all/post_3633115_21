S has a fascination with older cars.  Currently we are the proud owners of a 1966 Ford Galaxie 500.  This vehicle has now become mine since his car died and my car gets better gas mileage than the Galaxie.  I can assure you that I was not pleased.  The Galaxie has it out for me, I think.  There always seems to be something going wrong with it.  The problem is, whatever goes wrong with it tends to occur while I'm driving it and not while S is.  This stupid car has left me stranded at least three times now.  Let me add that I use it to pick up or drop off Shorty at day care.  Now imagine having to walk for a mile and a half with a three year old.  FUN!  Well, the number one reason that I hated this car was because it has no air conditioning.  Well, had.  Finally today, after owning the car for eight months, the air conditioner is now charged and blows cold.  I have finally found a new appreciation for this car.  And it isn't even August yet!
