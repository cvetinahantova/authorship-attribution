Good news!!! I have a nokia 8250 phone.Keshan please don't say i'm showing off.Well maybe i am but it's my 1st time owning a handphone of my own.It's such an old model,but anyway who cares what model it is.All that matters is that i've got a phone.I'll be getting a new one,one that i like and chose from the DBS brochure-a seimen CF62. I'm so delighted.
