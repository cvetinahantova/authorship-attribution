I went and saw TROY on the weekend and what stood out the most to me is how much we haven't changed through the thousands of years. In the movie we saw negotiation before the war and then war were they successfully killed hundreds of people.   When what we had and are doing is still doing take the Iraq issue, we saw the same thing negation of war and then the killing which we are still having. What makes us different to animals?  In my opinion its thought not instinct, yet we don't seem to want to utilize thought. It shocks me that we have a democratic society trying to change a dictatorship.   We should remember that IRAQ has been ruled by a dictatorship for thousands of years and when change occurs this should be taken into account.   We have so much death and destruction without thought we are able as a untied force to change these things. I feel the problem is we cant or don't want to unite and we don't even look at our own back yards before cleaning other societies back yards.  don't get me wrong a threat is a threat and most time force should be met with force.
