SignatureÂ  urlLink     urlLink     Just so we can say I knew you when...  On June 26, 2004, her signature was left on artwork...all over it, actually.  I think she was practicing, because she wrote her name  at least  4 times on this one piece of paper.  So exciting.  (Yes, it is going in her baby book...:))  I was watching "Never Been Kissed" again, this afternoon, and realized just how good looking those two guys are...Michael Vartan (go  urlLink Alias   ABC Sundays 9/8c ), and Jeremy Jordan.  Who'd've thunk...good looking guys appearing in movies...now THAT's a first.  But seriously...  They're really cute.  Right now, GrandDaddy is singing to Abbie.  I can hear it all the way in my room...and believe me, since they've added on to our house, its a long way!  So cute.  Well, wish me luck...Abbie took a late nap today, even though it was only...2 hours long (I told you.)  I am going to try to keep her entertained and make her tired enough to go to sleep.  Bathtime ought to be interesting.
