urlLink Finding Information on the Internet  This is a web searching tutorial from the UC Berkley Library. I think it is well done.  From the intro:  "This tutorial presents the substance of the Internet Workshops offered year-round by the Teaching Library at the University of California at Berkeley. The content on this site has been updated to reflect our new "Research Quality Web Searching" class. The title reflects our belief that there is a lot great material on the Web - primary sources, specialized directories and databases, statistical information, educational sites on many levels - and we have better tools for finding this great stuff."
