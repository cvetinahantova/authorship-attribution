Blogger is still experiencing problems delivering invitations for blog memberships. I've sent invitations to the following people already:   Aidz Angeles  Mark Gamis  Franklin  Hannah  Dale  Aidz Angeles  Celsus  Jam   Let me know if you still haven't received the emails by tomorrow, so I could send them again.   Update  The email thing seems to work better now... invites sent to Gmail still haven't been received though.
