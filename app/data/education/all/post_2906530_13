ARRGHH THE PAIN (that's right I'm back) The subject of my newest rant is that of my very first one. MUSIC!  Music in our fair land (its a bit of a dump really if you go to some council estates) has reached a new low. Why? Because topping the charts at the moment is "DJ casper" with his hopelessly lame dance hit the "cha cha slide". I have two reasons for hating this tune  1: It is completely unimaginative and is stupid with pathetic dance commands like "slide to the left, take it back now Y'all"  2: I had to endure this song twice daily for two weeks in august last year while on holiday in turkey (Turkish music is a hell of a lot better than that believe me its quite catchy, no wonder they won the eurovision song contest n.b I had to endure that song everyday too but that is a lot more manageable)   Another problem  is busted once again If it wasn't bad enough they tarnished the good name of rock with their previous songs but now they have done a cover of "teenage kicks" a brilliant song and their equivalent has made me cringe what with their sickly sweet untalented young vocal chords (ARRRGH!)
