Hey! Right now I'm in school, being super bored! Ohh, how fun...Anyways, right now I'm just sitting here looking around, trying to see the board with my assignment on it. But right now, I don't have my glasses with me so I can't see my assignments so I decided to post a Blog again... I have Yahoo web messenger going, I'm typing to all of my friends, and listening to the crappy music Mr. Gary is playing. Mr. Gary is my teacher for this period, in case you didn't know or if I haven't told you already. This morning I got really mad at my friends because in the morning they always run around the school, trying to avoid me. Then when I confront them about it, they always say that they were looking for me and that they were right where they always were in the cafeteria. I just think it is bad how my best friends are doing this to me right after I trusted them enough with my personal secrets. I guess that's my problem, though. Anyways, tomorrow and the day after we have testing :/ ... ... That's okay, though, I'm eager to get it over with. Anyways, I got to go, teacher is coming! Bye!
