so i got back from Kansas today. i had a lot of fun for once! we had a nice little hail storm so of course i have pretty dents on my car now but that's ok. so we went to the movies right? and the only theater that i know of is in the mall.. ok that mall could fit INSIDE the dillards at woodlandhills.. and it's only one story.. omg it was amazing to be able to walk from one end to the other in under 1 minute. so anyway.. we were talking about the hott guy in The Buckle and i was trying to talk Heather into talking to him because she'll never see him again when this guy on the bench laughs and starts talking to me! lol he was kinda cute but a little weird. he was 23 and with his friend who was 25. the 4 of us went to see The Chronicles of Riddick (we sat 2 rows behind them lol). that movie was like lord of the rings meets the matrix meets star wars! i only went for vin deisel... haha.   the main street in this town isn't even equivalent to 71st.. the speed limit.. was 20.. i wondered why i smoked a mustang full of middle aged mexican men who were whistling at Heather and me.. it's because i took off and they were obeying the law! weirdo kansas ppl..   oh and Chris called me today! that was really exciting i missed him. i'm going down there on tuesday to see him!
