I'm not sure if it has to do with being brought up in a city battered by North Sea gusts or with just being a miserable sod, but I  hate  this hot weather. I am sticky and cranky and no matter how much weight I drop, I will never look like anything but a cartoon ham in summery clothes.  I guess I'll just have to sweat it out (literally) until the season of coats and scarves and proper tailoring.  Have left Chris at the Tate Modern drinking tea and come home to do my concerfuckingtina book. I have no idea where to begin. Current plan: find as many pictures as possible then print 'em out at A4. Stick down. Fold. Will that do? Also have resource board to make. Bugger.  Sport is happening on television. That is all I know about that.  Had row with Chris because he thinks I should phone all the PGCE people since Babs told me to make sure they all know that we start at nine tomorrow. But I can't be assed. I am crap rep but I don't care.  Goodbye x
