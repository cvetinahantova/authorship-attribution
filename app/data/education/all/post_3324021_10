The loss suffered today can be blamed 100% on myself. I don't feel as though I really wanted this office. Therefore I didn't work hard to get it. I would though, like to congratulate yesterday's winners.  2004-2005 SA Senators:  Andrew Dickson (i) Kathleen Gorski (i) Georgeanne Inempolidis (i) Josie Pike  Annie Sorge Kate Swenson (i)  2004-2005 Class Senators:  Laura Andercovich Greg Carmody Taylor Hauck Liz Lightbody Owen Maher Kerri Marowske  *(i) denotes incumbent returning for a second term  Overall, I think that the 6 SA senators you have elected will to a fantastic job, they all have a year of some kind of student government experience. As for class, it might be a rocky start, many fresh faces are entering the game, and have little to work with.
