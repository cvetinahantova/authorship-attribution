Boy, does it feel good to just  sleep . Well, that's what I have been doing the last 2 days. Though my bones feel like rubber now. I need to go back and do some good exercise.  On Thursday was the all-day grading madness. Not only did I have to get there by 9 am, but it lasted all day. By the time I was finished my hand was all contorted and twisted on itself.  Fear the claw!  Wednesday was proctoring day. Which means that I had to sit for 3 hours in a quiet room and watch students quiver in fear over the exam. That was fun for a while, but soon got tiring.  Which brings us back to today. I got up early this morning and began making ravioli. With spinach dough and ricotta and Roquefort (that's blue cheese for those who don't know) filling. I  was  going to make another batch of bolognese, but by the time I was done my back ached so much that I hat to lie down and get some rest. Then I got up and began reviewing the application for a professor's ADDS status.  I also noticed that as a  urlLink Blogger  user I get to beta-test  urlLink Gmail . If I like the service I will probably end up migrating my Netscape mail over to that one. Despite all the hype about the privacy concerns of Gmail, I don't think it's any worse than other web-based e-mail offerings. Having said that, my address is docboobenstein  at  gmail.com . And before anyone asks, no, my ACM address is still the main one. The Netscape one was just used for mailing lists and whatnot, and the Gmail one will serve the exact same purpose.
