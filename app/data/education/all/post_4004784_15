Donna Ann, If I promise Checki won't be there, will you come?? But honestly, the boy should come with you.  We all love him, especially Mel.  Melly loves him extra, don't you baby ;p Anyway, I hope everyone can make it and I will make any party concessions you want, such as all Madonna music, or no fruit on the buffet table.  Looking forward to it!! Hehe  Just as a word to all, attendance is highly suggested  Miss you all!
