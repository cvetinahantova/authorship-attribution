TV on DVD just got a little sweeter today...  Universal has just released the first season of  Knight Rider  on DVD.   I am so there.  There was just something about super-powered vehicles that got me all charged up as a kid.  I watched  Dukes  for the General Lee, and  Knight  because the car had missiles and a jet booster.   So tomorrow I'm gonna plunk down $50 and buy it, then watch two episodes and probably realize that Hasselhoff's not as cool as I remember him, the effects are laughable, and the plotlines are bad cheese.  And revel in the nostalgia anyway.  When's  Airwolf  coming out, dammit?
