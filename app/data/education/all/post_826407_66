First Sunday of Advent!!!!  I love this time of preparing.  The promise, the not quite there yet.  Seems to me that the world needs the light more than ever right now.  And in my own life I really want to know more deeply the God who has walked among us.  These were three quotes from some Advent readings this morning:  "People of Israel, lets live by the light of the lord"  "Night is almost over and the day will soon appear"  Let the Lord Jesus Christ be as near to you as the clothes you wear"  I guess they sum up what I want from this Advent and Christmas.
