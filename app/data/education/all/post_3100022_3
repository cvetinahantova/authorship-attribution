Rome, was pretty awesome, the cicstine chapple was definatly a highligh. and our tourguide went that extra little bit of distance for us, and we managed to see all the good things on top of the standard touristy things too. The coloseum, well its pretty big, and I can now say that I have seen it. But the only wonder is really how something like this could have been build all those many years ago.  Highlight of the trip so far, an amazing feat of engineering, and something that is still confusing engineers today - the pantheon. I was truly speachless and the first sighting of this monstrous creation - I really recommend rome for this alone allthough it only takes up about ive minutes of your time. it really is an amazingly beautifull structure, I have photos of it too, but I aren't able to upload them yet.
