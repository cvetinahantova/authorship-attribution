urlLink Rise of Nations  This looks like a neat game but...  It gives the opportunity to dominate 6,000 years of world history.  From the site, "Combining pulse-pounding real-time gaming with the epic scope of turn-based strategy games, Rise of Nations gives you a fast and fun experience..."  So, how exactly does real time gaming work when the game spans 6,000 years?  Will my family be playing this game for countless generations to come?  Will I become exremely long lived?  Does this mean the programmers don't have to finish the game yet because it will be a good 5,000+ before even the best players can get nuclear weapons?  Sometimes I wonder what they are thinking when they write ad copy.
