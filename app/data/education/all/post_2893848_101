the stars at night  by Scott i'll be leaving for austin texas and its south by southwest  urlLink festival  early thursday morning, so i wanted to report that should i be able to make internet contact, i will post from there. there's no doubt there will be hijinks from the new south to report. i don't know the entymology of the word hijinks. my only plan for shows is to see several bloodshot records acts, since i will be accompanying their director of promotions, my friend rebecca. also, i will be attending the suicide girls burlesque show. so pray for me. while you're praying, slip in a good word for my pal rodney, who sells the Streetwise newspaper. he still doesn't believe in god, but today informed me that he doesn't believe in self-fulfilling prophecy either, so, in his opinion, "that leaves little else."
