Khaaaan!   Well, there's been a lot of things happening over the weekend. On the one hand, I applied for a position as a sessional teacher for one of the intro courses at UWaterloo. Which I hope I get, because I could really use that extra money, what with the next semester rolling up and tuition fees not getting any cheaper. If not I'm probably going to have to look for a second job. Yay. I'm trembling with excitement.  Then there's the work I'm doing towards my Thesis. I know it's probably too soon to even worry about it, but I want to get an early start and get some work done before I run into more deadlines along the road.  This whole being-the-tech-support-guy-for-the-whole-family is getting a bit on my nerves. I think I may start charging for that... I fix their computer, they buy me dinner. Or some shit like that.  I'm fascinated with  Quicksilver . Unlike  Cryptonomicon  (which was still an excellent book) this one got me hooked from page 1. No, wait, that's a lie. It was page 3. The only complaint that I have is that it's not going very easy on my back. I'm going to have to acquire a backpack where I can fit both the laptop and the book, plus some other things. Got to keep an eye on my health after all.
