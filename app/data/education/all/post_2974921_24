I am officially a very bad person…… no doubt about it. I totally am so mean and unforgiving…….oh my God, I’m a bitch……  I feel so guilty about Lyle yesterday. We chatted through YM and I was so rude. I kept cutting him and saying things that would let any idiot know that I’m angry at him. It was like I was blaming him for the rumors that had been around about me. I was blaming him that my high school life would be a living nightmare. I blamed him for everything….. Even if I didn’t want to. I know it’s not his fault because he said he didn’t lie about not having a girlfriend. Weird, huh? I just couldn’t help telling him. I don’t know. Maybe I’ve got issues, I always start fights. Anyway, I really felt bad when he said, “I do care” and I replied, “I’ve heard that too many times. They’re all the same….fakes” I felt even worse when he said, “Please don’t hate me” well... I don’t……. come to think of it, I think I still like you.  I felt even worse when I found myself being so mean to Jammi. I blew off the chance for us to talk. I disconnected because I was kind of upset because he was away for so long [shallow me]. We ended up talking that night. He was complaining about how his parents invite him to go out just so they could bond. He was reasoning that they could just bond at home. Good point…. We have the same problem…  Raxzeez, or whatever his name is, told me he loves me. I told him he’s crazy and he told me he’d be crazy…for me! What a cheesy pick-up line. I’m 13 but I’m not stupid. I told him I already have someone else in mind.   “someone else in mind” who? Jammi…..? or lyle?
