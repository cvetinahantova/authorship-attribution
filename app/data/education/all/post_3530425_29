She sat in the dark, smoking.  The light at the end of her cigarette made six stars in no constellation reflect in the mirrored glass of the storm windows at the end of the porch.  Removed from their windows in the sudden warm spring, they never got put properly away, but remained on the porch, awaiting autumn’s inevitable chill to be returned to their numbered windows.  When she exhaled, she could barely see the smoke issue from her lips and nostrils, trailing toward the back yard, behind the screens.  The cigarette’s ash neared her lips, becoming too hot to smoke, and she stubbed it out in the awaiting ashtray.  When she returned the ashtray to its hidden place (for her son must never know she smokes), the last bit of the butt glowed on, lighting its location for no one to find.
