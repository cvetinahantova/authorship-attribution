It's sunday night at 1:04 am. J.P.'s blog is pretty cool and I'm bored as hell, so I decided to create my own. If you don't know me, I am a math teacher/football coach and get the summer off. I should have started this thing at the beginning of the summer because it has been one of the wildest summers of my life. August should be interesting since it is my birthday and football is starting. If I don't think of anything to say on a certain day, I will write about memories from earlier in the summer. Enjoy!
