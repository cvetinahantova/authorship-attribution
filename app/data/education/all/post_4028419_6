Well, it's been a few days....A lot has gone down..kinda.  Not really, nevermind-lol.  So, I just had the WORST day emotionally.  I don't know WHAT is going on.  I talked to K and he is one of the brightest spots that I can think of.  He's really a dear because he actually bothered to listen to me.  Quite special, I would say.  So anyway, I am trying not to concentrate on feeling so sad and confused--but I guess because I can see so clearly the way my life COULD be, it is SO hard to be patient.  I don't know; why do I feel as if being patient is not the thing.  I feel like "why wait?"--although these things are rarely left up to us.   I really miss Aaliyah (lol, like I knew her).  But I was just reading through some old articles I have of her and she was just such a beautiful person with a beautiful soul.  You could see it in her face, in her eyes, in her life, in the people she left behind.  I think the most tragic of all is that she was so YOUNG.  But from the sound of it, she experienced a lot of things before she died--love, success, etc.--so she was still quite lucky.  I think, no, I KNOW that when she died, I had told myself that I was never going to waste a minute if I could help it.  Her being so young (about my age) and my "growing up with her" made me see my own mortality in an alarming way.  I just don't know how much time I have here and, as morbid as it may sound, I'm trying to capture EVERYTHING I can as soon as He sees fit, before I die.  I just wish everyone else would jump on the darned bandwagon...
