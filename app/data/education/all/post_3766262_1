Hello, hello.  So glad you could join me, take time out of your doubtlessly busy day to take a peek here.  As this site is newly born, I will have myriads of improvements to make, thoughts to jot down, and travel stories to share.  I may have some opinions you'll disagree with, and some that may offend or insult.  Please develop a tougher skin, know that I mean no harm, have no intention of damaging your ego, threatening your lifestyle, or poking at beliefs:)  If you are infuriated, please write me!   It'll be outstanding reading for sure, which I know I'll enjoy.  Really though, I'll most often log what I've been experiencing in my travels south of the US.  If it bores you, please stop reading; I would hate to be the cause of frustration and wasted time staring at a sterile computer screen!  Share any anecdotes, comments, or "hellos" as often as you'd like!  Adios!
