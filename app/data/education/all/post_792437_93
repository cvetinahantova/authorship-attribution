Do we care?    Â  I had to hear quite a few speeches tonight, and though I enjoyed most of them, there were some that rattled on. So it made me wonder...am I the only one? As I looked around the room there were quite a few in the same position, hoping that speech would end soon. Then I wondered..I too had given a speech, did people think the same of me?? Heck, then why do I spend time doing or writing a speech if most just sit there and nod so I can get it over with?? hmmm.....
