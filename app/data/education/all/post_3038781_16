Is it arrogance?   I woke up yesterday to one of the lectures of an evangelist preaching on the same teen-oriented channel that had played both  Charmed  and  Angel  the evening before... Not that this  is a problem, but having listened to a portion of his sermon ...at the very least, it's  a conflict of interest. What really caught my attention was one remark that the preacher/pastor/evangelist:   "It's   God's  Goal in life  to bring us closer to him."  I couldn't help but think that was the height of arrogance. Maybe, I'm wrong. If you give the messiah scenario full faith and credit, God will [or has already*] sacrificed his child to 'pay for our sins." But, I would like to think that God/The Creator/The Divine source... did not just stop with us. Talk about anti-climactic and unambitious.  No, I prefer to believe that God's not just a one trick pony...too obsessed with getting his first trick right to work on anything new. So, to me it's arrogant to think our salvation is God's Highest ambition and goal in life.  But let me know if I'm wrong.   *depending your religious affiliation.
