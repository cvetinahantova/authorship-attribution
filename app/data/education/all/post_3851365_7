I oscillate between despair, denial, and cautious optimism.  Wendy seems to be in better spirits the last few days, since coming home from her father's.  I really thought we got through to her that she must never lie to us again, and that she must obey the house rules.  But tonight she tried to do another spell in her room involving setting a piece of paper on fire.  Of course, the fire got bigger than the dish containing it, and we ran up there when we smelled the smoke.  Again, Craig and I had to reiterate that she is not allowed to burn things in her room, and that if she wants to burn things outside, one of us has to supervise.  What upsets me most is that she knew she was not supposed to do this, but she did it anyway because she wanted the right to "get closer to her gods".  She feels we don't understand her religion, whatever that is  - wiccan I guess.    I told her that if she lies or goes behind our back one more time, I am sending her back to her dad's.
