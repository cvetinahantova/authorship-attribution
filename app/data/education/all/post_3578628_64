Due to verbal negative feedback on  Mixing Sports...with Josh Hall , I'm afraid it may have to be cancelled.  The producers have found that people just aren't interested in these sort of things, especially when you mix it with technology, but before they cancel it, they would like to take a poll.    If you would like to keep the articles the way they are:        1.)Leave a comment stating that you like them  If you would like to change the articles in some way:        2.)Leave a comment stating your ideas  If you would like the show to be eliminated because you don't feel it would be read enough for anybody to care:        3.)Leave a comment stating that you want it cancelled  Yes...I'm mainly being funny, but I do want you to participate in the "poll."  I don't want to waste my...or your...time looking up information and putting it on here if only one person is going to read and comment on it.  Once again...mainly being funny, but am serious as well. -Thanks!
