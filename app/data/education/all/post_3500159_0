Today is Memorial Day and while we attended the requisite party at our good friends Jeff and Kathi's house, I had to think about the deeper meaning of Memorial Day. Although I have always known the true meaning, before now it has just been a day for fun, cooking out, and entertaining.  Now I realize that it is about remembering those who have died both in wars and not.  I spent a lot of the day talking to my neighbor about what a brewmiester my cousin was.  Then a new neighbor arrived.  He has to be in his late 80's and is a WWII veteran.  He ate with us, talked to the kids and even shared a beer with the guys.  I was in awe of him because he is just a neat old man and he had so much fun just talking and watching the kids swim.  He just lost his wife of many years in January and yet here he was still seeking out friendships with his neighbors who are young enough to be his grandchildren. What a cool guy!  And we did have a nice day just relaxing by the pool, eating and watching our kids play.  It is great to have good friends!
