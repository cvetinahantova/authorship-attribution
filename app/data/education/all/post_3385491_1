I'm here because I just finished reading Richard Ferdig's and Kaye Trammell's article on "Content Delivery in the Blogosphere" (www.thejournal.com/magazine/vault/A4677.cfm) urlLink   and I want to see how this works out. Since I work in a high school, I think it would be awesome if our library set aside some blog-time for our students -- or better yet, if blogs could be used in our English classes instead of standard journal writing. I feel strongly that kids would write more. In any case, I'm always willing to try something new. The last time I had a bad experience trying something new, I ended up hating lima beans; but that was a long time ago. I've been lucky since then!  So, what do you think, do you see Blogs as a good classroom tool?  ~ K
