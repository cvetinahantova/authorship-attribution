urlLink Universally Designed Instruction. ERIC/OSEP Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Eric Orkwis.  It looks at the issues that factor into universally designed instruction.  From the ERIC Digest:  By definition, universal design for learning (UDL) is the design of instructional materials and methods that makes learning goals achievable by individuals with wide differences in their abilities. Universal design is attained by means of flexible curricular materials and activities that provide alternatives for students. As much as possible, these "designed-in" alternatives, which include different assistive technologies and cognitive supports, do not have to be added by teachers. However, effective use of the materials requires that the teacher be familiar with the various teaching strategies necessary to reach students of widely varying abilities, and many teachers are not.   UDL is an approach to learning in which curriculum designers have considered the scope of student abilities and learning styles, taking into account varying abilities to see, hear, speak, move, read, write, comprehend English, attend, organize, engage, and remember. They then create a "package" of classroom resources and situations that can be used as desired to meet the needs of these individuals. UDL encourages learning through a combination of flexible materials and methods that provide access, challenge, and engagement for each student.   Different explanations of UDL use different terms to describe its structure. For instance, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST), discusses UDL in terms of multiples: multiple representation of content, multiple means of expression, and multiple options for engagement. Behind this approach is the idea that individual brains receive and process information very differently, so instruction should be designed to accommodate those differences.
