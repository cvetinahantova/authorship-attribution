"Everyone has a point of view, but Mister God hasn't. Mister God has only points to view."  What about this difference between 'a point of view' and 'points to view'? This stumped me, but a little further questioning cleared up the mystery. 'Points to view' was a clumsy term. She meant 'viewing points'. The second salvo had been fired. Humanity in general had an infinite number of points of view, whereas Mister God had an infinite number of viewing points. When I put it to her this way and asked her if that was what she meant, she nodded her agreement and then waited to see if I enjoyed the taste. Let me see now. Humanity has an infinite number of points of view. God has an infinite number of viewing points. That means that - God is everywhere. I jumped.  Anna burst into peals of laughter. "You see," she said, "you see?"   I did too.   "There's another way that Mister God is different...Mister God can know things and people from the inside too. We can only know them from the outside, don't we? So you see, Fynn, people can't talk about Mister God from the outside; you can only talk about Mister God from the inside of Him."  ~ 'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn
