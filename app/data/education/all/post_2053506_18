While I was in KC visiting my  mom we had a chance to visit a nearby tea room.  It's called The Main Street Mill Historic Tea Room in Smithvville, MO.  It was also a little gift shop.  Here are some photos.                               We had a good time.  The food was wonderful, and their iced raspberry tea was so smooth and refreshing.  The service was mighty slow though.  They had one waitress working the whole place - when we were there there were probably 9 other tables.  But we would go back in a heartbeat.
