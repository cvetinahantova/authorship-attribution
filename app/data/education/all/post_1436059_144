Soy viviente vida solo.  It snowed today. In less than a week we've had eighty-degree weather, rain, shine, wind, and snow. It's crazy spring weather, and it's making me more crazy by the day. I can't stand this weather.  In Agriscience at CATN we made corsages. It was kind of fun. Then we left the greenhouse and it was snowing. Amber and I were the last people on the OM bus.  In P.E. we started volleyball. It was incredibly boring.  Govt. and English were boring too.   Track is killing me almost. I ran four miles today in under seven and a half minutes each, though my first mile was a lot faster than seven minutes. There was also warm-up and cool-down too.  I have Tae Kwon Do now! Yay! It's Wednesday class so I'm happy.
