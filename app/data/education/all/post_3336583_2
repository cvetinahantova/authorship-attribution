Martha and I were preparing the 5th grade files for middle school when Cathy from the front office comes in to ask us a few questions. As Martha was writing a note Cathy noticed the pen she was using. She asked Martha where she got the pen. I told her that it was mine and I got it from a parent. At this point, Cathy had a puzzled look on her face. I explained that the parent works for a medical lab and she sends me pens, post-its, etc... I said, "I wouldn't use the supplies if it had something like Viagra written on it." Cathy then informed me that Lavitra (which was what was written on the pen) is another type of Viagra! We were all laughing and wondering if the parent was trying to tell me something. What makes it even funnier is that I have more than one of those "Lavitra" pens and I had been using them at parent meetings! I just hope none of the parents realized what was written on that pen!
