James and I have a theory that most people think of the Internet as a Big Dark Cloud.  The original BDC came from the box of our  urlLink D-link wireless router , where the  urlLink handy set-up diagram  showed the computer connection. Oh!  The computer bone's connected to the router bone! The router bone's connected to the cable modem bone! The cable modem bone's connected to the - you guessed it - the Notorious B.D.C. bone.  :(  I thought it would be fun to search Gügel for the BDC (is that a metasearch?), and this is what I came up with.  I haven't really read it, but I think he's putting forth a concerted effort to wax comical.  Post your r(ants/aves/iots/esidues) and let me know what tú piensas.  Also try looking up his new words  urlLink potatos  and  urlLink moreso  on Merriam-Webster.  You'll find that they don't exist.  Unfortunately, what do exist are his comic book collections and critiques of poor UK movies.  All in all, I rate it Ph - for Phuglerific.  PS Nice beer bottle, Mikey Boy.
