discursive formations ...................................  I invite any and all of you to help me develop this entry...as you develop your own explanations (on your blogs or wherever...) I'll try to link and   them into this entry.  Just a quick refresher -- that in class we talked about the idea that discursive formations are the ..."conversations that we stand on."   urlLink     Like sedimentary rocks -- discursive formations develop over time in particular places.  Like sedimentary rocks -- we stand on, climb and explore discursive formations as if they were real, but  Like sedimentary rocks -- they aren't finished, complete or unchangeable.    A hundred years, an explosion or a pickaxe could change them a little or a lot.  I gave examples of discursive formations -- law, family, love, school and race.  They're real, but they've been created.  We use them, but by using them, we also reinforce their reality. Here's a website that talks about  urlLink Discursive Formations  (this brief overview connects the idea of a "discursive formation" to knowledge more generally).    Remember that I mentioned that Foucault (in class) was really the guy who most clearly talked about discursive formations.  Well here he is --  urlLink  himself  -- writing about Discursive Formations.  His writing is dense and rewards diligence...  If you want to make some connections between Foucault's thinking and other philosophers --  urlLink here's  a link Dr. John Rothfork makes some of those connections.  But *truly* don't feel like you have to read these sources -- I'm not sure that they make the concept any EASIER than I did in class.  It's just that they add TEXTURE.  If you're feeling intrigued -- these resources will add some interest to your day.  It's a conversation we'll be developing all semester....  Do you have a blog yet?     urlLink Email me  when you do...so i can build a comprehensive list of our class...
