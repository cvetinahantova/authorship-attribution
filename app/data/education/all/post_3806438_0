Kenyon Martin is a  urlLink restricted free agent  this off season.  If any team offers him a contract, the Nets can match the offer and keep him if they want to.  Problem is, they don't know if they want to.  He'll almost certainly get offers from the Hawks (a wasteland, he'd be stupid to accept it) and the Nuggets (a great up and coming club with Carmelo Anthony to build around).  The Nuggets could offer him the max salary and it would be tempting to move out west with the Lakers breaking up and everyone else in limbo at the moment (with the exception of San Antonio who needs only Duncan and Parker to be great).  I think K-Mart is made infinitely better by Jason Kidd, so in that respect he'd be silly to leave.  On the other hand, if Denver offers him a huge deal, that might be tough to turn down.  I don't think the Nets want to match a gigantic contract like that.  As much as I love K-Mart, his days as a Net might be over.
