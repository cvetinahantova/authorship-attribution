So this whole American Idol thing came from the British show Pop Idol, right? Anyway, we've all heard of Kelly, Justin, Ruben, Clay, and so on. From time to time, I even see Kim Caldwell (Season 2) on the TV Guide channel. Well, today as I was working on my computers, this song called 8th World Wonder came on. I was digging it, and then I looked at the title and it was Kimberly Locke! The 2nd runner-up from Season 2. She's a heckuva singer!  You can check the song out on AOL or call your local pop/rock station and request it.  Nice job, Kim.
