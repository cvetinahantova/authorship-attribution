Because of what I, Robot did, I want to predict that Halle Berry's film CatWoman will make a considerable amount of money.  But she's got something else going for her that I am not sure Will Smith has.  Will Smith (while possibly being good looking for some) isn't notable for his appearance like Halle Berry.  Halle Berry's got everything.  And wearing a leathersuit while kicking ass is sexy.  There's no doubt that people will want to see her do her stuff.  I am guessing this movie could be a turkey (This is a term for a movie that really is awful when it comes out like Gigli.  Movies like these make little to no money.) and still be hot cause of Halle Berry.  By the way, Halle Berry is keeping her CatWoman suit for the next man she becomes attracted to.  I wonder what lucky man will get to enjoy a night with CatWoman.  I can only imagine how awesome it could be.
