Wow, it is so, so hot!  It was high 90's today, and is suppose to hit 101 tomorrow.  Yes, world it does actually get hot in Oregon!  I just talked to my dad, who just flew in from Fullerton CA on a business trip.  He was saying how he was telling the others that he was going home to a hotter place.  They could'nt beleive it.  Dad going to S. Cal for a little cool down, now that seems funny! Hey, I'll take low 90's with low humidity anyday over this humid 100 degree torture.  I have to admit though, having air conditioning is pure indulgance!  Growing up with out it we just roasted!  Could'nt sleep or anything!   John and I drove down to Salem to go to his favorite restaurant, Changs.  It's a Mongolian BBQ style place.  Very yummy, you just got to make sure you don't eat to much, or let me tell you, you'll be miserable!  Just 3 more days until we hit the rode.  I quess that will mean 2 1/2 weeks without blogging.  I quess I'll survive.  As of a week or so ago, I didn't even know it exsisted.  I must admit, blogging is a fun activity!  I'm wondering what will happen when I go back to work in the fall.  I suppose my blogs will become shorter and fewer between, but I really do hope to keep up with it.  It is really fun to keep up with other freinds blog's too!
