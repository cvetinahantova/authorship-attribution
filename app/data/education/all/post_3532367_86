Got back from Leicester at 18:45, an hour later than when I usually get home. There was no-one home. Managed to get in a quick cup of coffee before going out to a school meeting at 19:00. Inevitably, that over-ran, home again for 21:30 then off to bed an hour later, after some tea.  Sandra asked where I had been and I said I had expected to have to work over due to being late back from the bank (she didn't know I'd booked the afternoon off sick). We went to bed, in silence and both tired.
