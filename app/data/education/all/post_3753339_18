Work:  Wrote four pages of my dissertation and two plus pages of fiction!  Go me!  Comments:  Said goodbye to Margot again.  V. sad.  Worked all day (I must call my sister tomorrow, as I was supposed to call her tonight and did not).  Have a lot of family things to do tomorrow...I hope I don't sleep so late that they don't get done.  I'm quite proud of myself for banging out the pages on my dissertation.  I also modded heavily at TDD today, as the iiidjits are out in force, of course.  I should be quite tired, as I couldn't have received more than 6 hours of sleep, but I stayed up all day without taking a nap.  Unfortunately, I've been flat awful, and I had three cokes today.  So very bad!  I craved sweets all night, and I didn't walk or lift--I'll have to do at least one tomorrow.  Obviously I need to work on balance--things fell apart in terms of diet/exercise once Margot arrived.  Erg.  I should clean tomorrow.
