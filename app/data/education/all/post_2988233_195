basically no changes overnight other than Savannah will open her eyes and flail around like she is hurting.  Her ammonia is staying the same.  The doc said it is up to her.  Also, the longer she stays like this, the worse it is.  High ammonia levels cause brain damage.  Renee and Stan got to sleep last night, they both needed it very bad.     More updates later.
