I watched 'Pirates of the Caribean' again.  Dude.  Keira Knightley makes me want to knock myself in the head with a frying pan.  She's such a fox.        I watched the dvd extra features and hearing that British accent killed me.  The accent, man.  It's dangerous.  I just know it's going to get me into trouble someday.
