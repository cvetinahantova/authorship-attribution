urlLink A day to remember    Well, after the  urlLink fiasco  yesterday I spent a great deal at night redoing the whole fucking thing. The good news is that I finished not only with the top-level architecture repair, but also with subsystem repair. The bad news is that now I need to write up the report for the whole thing. Well, at least I got a good night's sleep... Something I haven't had for quite a while.
