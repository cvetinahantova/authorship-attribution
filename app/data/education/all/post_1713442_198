urlLink Illinois Libraries  This site gives access to the text of articles from the journal  Illinois Libraries .  Currently, all issues from 1998 to the present are available.  It also appears as though the intent is to get all the issues back to 1950 online as well.  This is a good solid library journal with contributions from librarians across the USA despite the obvious Illinois focus.  I have published 5 papers here myself.  It is also indexed by  ERIC  and  Library Literature .  I think most librarians could find an article of interest within a few minutes of browsing.
