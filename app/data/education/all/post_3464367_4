Living is hard work and sometimes even cumbersome.  I find myself trying to do my day to day responsibilities, but I often do not have time for me.  I get so caught up with doing the basics, I don't have a chance to really enjoy the blessings of today.    When was the last time you took a deep breath and smelled the sweet air of spring?  Or when was the last time you looked at the beautiful trees and flowers God has made?  Or listened to the churping birds?  Or really tasted every morsal of a fattening dessert?  We can get engrossed with day to day activiities, so much that we foget about the good of right now.    That is why it is so important to find a healthy balance.  Take a momment out of each day and enjoy it. You must work a little to prepare for tomorrow but you must also play a little to appreciate today.  Whether it is looking at something pleasant, or smelling something nice, of listening to a beautiful sound, or my favorite, enjoyig the taste of delicous treats.  Just make sure you appreciate what  urlLink God has done  and smile.  :)
