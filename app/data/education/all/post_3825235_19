Fun in the pool with GrandDaddy!Â  urlLink     urlLink     Can't you just see the beauty in that picture???  I love it...And GrandDaddy looks good, too...hehe.  Well, it is not often that we can go swimming, since AbbieDabbie has tubes in her ears, and she had SO much fun today.  We went to my uncle's house and there were lots of people there, and some were even kids (close to) her age.  She loves being around people.  For the first time, her earplugs actually didn't fall out at all!  YAY!  (it did take a bit of adjustment every once in a while, though.)  We need to do stuff like that more often, because she fell asleep at their house before we left.  Now, THAT's a first.  Well, tomorrow is the first day of my early schedule at work, so I better get to sleep.  Especially considering that the last 3 nights the earliest I have gotten to sleep was 2:30.  I need my beauty rest.  (and lots of it...j/k)
