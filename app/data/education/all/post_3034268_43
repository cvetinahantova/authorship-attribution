Eye of the Hurricane  I have finally finished all of the business with the Citizenship paper and take-home test for the Law and Economics class.  I was up until about 4:00 a.m. last night, and because of all the caffeine in my system, I never really got to sleep, although I was out of bed by 6:00 a.m..  That was a legitimately difficult three days.  I'm granting myself a few hours break and a single good night's sleep tonight, although tomorrow I have to get back to the fight.  I have yet another large project that will be presented on Wednesday.  I'll be returning to Heraclitus and strife, although I am shifting my focus from the interpretation of his fragments to an existential and phenomenological examination of strife and overcoming obstacles.  I'll be blogging about strife and obstacle-overcoming constantly for the next few days as a result. It should prove to be an interesting presentation for Student Achievement Day, if you're available to see some of the presentations.    I'm looking forward to this project.  The business about citizenship, education, law and such was fun, but not my primary interest.  Perhaps some other time.  Tomorrow, I will begin researching by reading through Nietzsche's  Thus Spoke Zarathustra  for the second time.  That is a fabulous and fun book to read.  Check out this blog for the barrage of thoughts that will be stimulated by that book.    But for now, I'm going to bed at the sweet time of 9:14 p.m..  The academic war will resume at 5:30 a.m..  God, I feel like I'm in the Marines again.  Except there's no camoulflage paint or machine guns.  But other than that, its identical.  Actually, philosophy would be more fun with camoulflage paint and machine guns.  I'll bring it up to Dr. Christensen.  Good night.
