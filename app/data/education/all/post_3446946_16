You’re wrong on  urlLink panning  the complaints regarding the ads near mosques. It’s not a matter of being “politically correct” and certainly not a matter of it being out of control. It’s a matter of economics and should be one of political libertarianism. Economically, the ad company might find it is a bad idea to post an ad that will offended the people who will see the ad most often (let alone people who will not buy the product), in this case, a group of Moslems.  But it should also be the right of those Moslems, in their immediate and local neighborhoods, to not suffer such a glaringly offensive (to them) advertisement. It’s the government’s place to allow different forms and styles of advertising, but it is not the government’s place to say that people must accept all form of adverting in all locations. Televisions and radios can be turned off, print ads thrown out. But it does not seem such a horrible thing to ask an advertising company not to post a billboard of nearly-naked women in the neighborhoods of people who want to avoid such mental temptations. Furthermore, the local government should have the right to place some guidelines on the types of adverting in a certain area.  And this is all coming from a guy who is a big fan of nearly-naked women.   [Sent to Andrew Sullivan]
