from last night:  ben:  lara and me are like kindling -- we ignite the excitement in each other, and act like little kids  (clear in context, sounds kinda shady in print =P)  9:15 this morning (phone rings) me: hi grandma!  how are you? grandma pudwell: hi lara!  happy birthday! me: um, thanks grandma: it is your birthday, isn't it?  i just wanted to be the first to wish you a happy birthday. me: it's tomorrow, but thanks -- so you are the first :-) grandma: oh!  the 22nd? me: nope, still the 21st... today's the 20th grandma: ooooh, well i haven't mailed your card out yet, and i guess i was the first to call you -- have a good day and have a happy birthday tomorrow, i'll talk to you then  (dude, my grandma's great :-))  austin powers (the original one) is on TBS right now... it started while i was finishing lunch... i've only seen it once before (probably in 1998, the year after it came out) and i wasn't the most amused by it then... however, even though some of it i still think is really dumb, i'm actually halfway amused so far this time through... maybe i'll actually stay put and watch the whole thing =P  joy.  later dudes.
