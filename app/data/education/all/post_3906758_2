This is a picture of group A  in math class. These students are paying very close attention to what the teacher is saying. They are learning and reviewing  math problems. It seems like these students are really concentrating on what the teacher is saying. In this picture you see that the students are working in groups. Others are  still trying to get the problem.  If  its diffiult for them, the tutors are there to help them. I think this is a picture of success because  you can see that the students are looking strait on what they're focused on. I took this picture because at that moment everyone seemed  very interested on the math problem. Looking at this picture and seeing how these students work together as a team will bring them up to the top and get to a way higher level. By keeping it up they will experience new things in life and they will also be able to get into a good college.
