Ok so I'm getting my three friends now (Josh and Kevin get what I'm saying) because everyone needs to go to camp next year!!! I'm serious u guys have no idea how much fun it would be to have everyone go.  It was seriously nonstop fun for the entire week...unbelievable.  It's not even explainable.  There's so much to do!! You can swim, or climb stuff or have someone make u fly in the air and into a lake, or go on a zip line into a lake, or walk on ropes, or go biking and so0o0o0o0 much more.  It's so easy to do stuff as a group too!  Some stuff is required for u to do, and then they give you free time so you can do whatever you want.  It's the best ever!! EVERYONE needs to go next year - EVERYONE.  It's seriously the best experience you'll ever have.
