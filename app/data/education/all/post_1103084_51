- Theological nugget -   The readings in church were great today --   pulled together Genesis 1:28 - in the image of God were they made...  WITH  Matthew [...hmmm...] do we pay tax or no? whose IMAGE is on the coin?  Render to Ceaser that which is his, and unto God that which is his.  AND  2 Cor 5 therefore we are ambassadors pleading -- BE RECONCILED to GOD --  the connection of God's image being essential to human beings -- then the ways that so many forces have corrupted that divine image with instutional obligations, the worship of power -- and finally that the new tradition -- initiated by Christ is to call the whole world back into reconciliation -- the symbol of the Divine within us is like a sign cut off from its referent -- just like Baudrillard & Lyotard describe --   and our calling is to be calling to reconcile the world to its maker....  peace~ andrew
