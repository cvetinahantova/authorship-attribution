Good grief I agree, Krissy! I couldn't figure out how to get from the Blue Blog screen back to where you can post! I did figure out how to make Comments on the other posts, but then I realized you cant really see those! But anyway... Cait, great idea to set this up! :-) I think it's AWESOME! :-) Whatcha doin' on your vacation? I hope you do somethin' fun.  I can't wait...only 9 more days of work! Not that I don't like it, but...:-). Both my bosses were kinda crankie today, but then they cheered up after I got them to chase an errant grasshopper (yes a real one!) that was living on the other desk in the room where I sit!  Darn, it's only 8:23 and the sun is almost set! I CANT STAND WHEN THE SUN SETS EARLY! hehe.  Karen, your sister looked BEAUTIFUL! My goodness! What a cool wedding!  I also can't believe our lil reunion was over a week ago! I was so lonely after everyone left! There's really no one as good as all y'all that came to Shea and Bayville...other people really don't compare. :-)  ("Cannn youuuu feeeeellll the loveeee toniteeee....") hehe, I am in a goofie mood, can you tell!  Thank you to everyone for coming and to those who helped set it up, too! I love how we all just pop back together and it feels like we never were apart. Awwww :-) Anyway, Hello to all and I misss you! ;-) Love always, Deee ps - here is a funny story: at my brother and Karen's block partyu, my neph Joey drank droplets of soda and beer from the cans in the RECYCLING BIN! EWWWW! :-)
