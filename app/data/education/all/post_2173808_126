Of course, everyone is claiming that John Kerry picked John Edwards because of his youth, charisma, and southern roots,  but the NYT lets slip the REAL  urlLink story :   Several people pointed to the secretive and exclusive Bilderberg conference of some 120 people that this year drew the likes of Henry A. Kissinger, Melinda Gates and Richard A. Perle to Stresa, Italy, in early June, as helping win Mr. Kerry's heart. Mr. Edwards spoke so well in a debate on American politics with the Republican Ralph Reed that participants broke Bilderberg rules to clap before the end of the session. Beforehand, Mr. Edwards traveled to Brussels to meet with NATO officials, brandishing his foreign-policy credentials.   "His performance at Bilderberg was important," said a friend of Mr. Kerry who was there. "He reported back directly to Kerry. There were other reports on his performance. Whether they reported directly or indirectly, I have no doubt the word got back to Mr. Kerry about how well he did."   So the  urlLink Bilderberg Conference  plays a key role in  urlLink Skull and Bones  member John Kerry's VP choice in his race against fellow Bonesman George W. Bush.  All we need are connections to the  urlLink Freemasons ,  urlLink Jesuits ,  urlLink Fletcher Prouty , and the  urlLink Queen of England  for a grand unified conspiracy theory of American politics.  The  urlLink LaRouchites  must be having a field day.
