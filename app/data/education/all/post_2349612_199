so i finished posting pictures and landed on vh1.. they're doing a special of the "top 50 most awesomely bad songs ever"... only i'm not watching it for that they think you should be watching for  as far as their picks, 2/3 really do belong on the list...  but billy joel's "we didn't start the fire" for example shouldn't be if their reasoning is "pop music cool, history not cool, try again"... while maybe not like the absolute best song of the century, it IS a unique song from when someone told billy joel none of the good history happened before '80 or so, and he started writing the world events of his life and found a beat to it... it's catchy, and a trip through the last 50 years... or bette midler's "from a distance" being even higher up on the list because "God watching us all the time is just a creepy concept" -- whatever; they're not analyzing quality/unquality of music, they're picking on songs that conflict with their "we're vh1 and therefore we're cool" philosophy ;-P  nah, mostly i'm watching because the comedians, singers, magazine editors, actors, and commetators they have analyzing are completely ridiculous -- they all have such a serious "i'm a world expert on this" look pasted on their faces, and they all sound so dumb, full of themselves, and mostly ridiculous... it's more like watching a car wreck of commentators than of bad music videos like they intended... oh well... that's my morning entertainment, eh? =P
