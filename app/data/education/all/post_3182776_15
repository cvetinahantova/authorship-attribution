Suddenly found a rich vein of something approaching motivation. Don’t know where this came from, but there it is, like an extra toy in my box of Frosties. I feel quite energetic and inspired. Tonight I read some of an educational publication and found myself  enjoying it.    I’m scaring myself. It can’t last.  Taught my first lesson at Askes (Or, Asskiss, as Hav insists on pronouncing it) today- nothing fancy, just a cover with some worksheets. Had the year seven boys almost literally eating out of my proverbial hand, though, and for a while there I felt like I might almost be okay at it. This feeling will last until my first encounter with a mardy year 9 girl, especially if she's taller than me, which seems to be happening more and more.   I'd like to write more but my housemate Natalie is watching ITV dramas at a volume that's threatening to stress fracture my ribcage. It's interrupting my narrative flow no end. I'll have to get back to you tomorrow.  Hope you had a good day too.
