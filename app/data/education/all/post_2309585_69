Ok, let the record show that I'm a total wussy.  I went to my first weight training class today. We meet four days a week for a month. Every class begins with 30 minutes of cardio. Then we do reps on the weight machines. Like, all of them. Seriously. Something like 12 different machines we have to use. Then we end with 25 ab crunches.  My body is already screaming at me.
