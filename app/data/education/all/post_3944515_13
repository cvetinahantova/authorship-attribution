Haha.. I haven't been posting for the past week.. Really busy.. Well, to summarise the week's events.. Eventful lolx.. Quite tied up these few days with schoolwork.. Stress level very high..The only good thing was that i submitted one of the projects.. Finally..Phew.. Hmm.. Got to know a new friend through this website:-  urlLink www.wholivesnearyou.com  . It basically shows who lives in your neighbourhood.. Abit freaky but fun.. Oh ya about that friend.. He's a year younger than me but very interesting and fun to be with.. And the world is so small.. I just found out that he used to be my best friend's ex-neighbour.... Should i be glad or freaked out? You tell me.. Haha.. Haiz.. Wanted to go out with him watch the fireworks on sun night but he didn't want to come out.. Ok i understand.. You live quite a distance away.. I don't want you to think that i'm unreasonable, i let you have your space..  --*--It's National Day!!--*..
