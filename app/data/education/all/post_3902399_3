With the 2004 Presidental elections getting closer, there has been talk that the new documentary "Farenheit 9/11" is anti-Bush propaganda. Some feel this movie is being advertised and pushed in the media and aimed at certain demographics as a vehicle to generate Democratic votes. What is your take on it? Do you feel the release of "The Manchurian Candidate" will have any effect on the election?
