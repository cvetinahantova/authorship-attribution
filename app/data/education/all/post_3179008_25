What a burn out I am seeing. The teacher I work with is not filling the students' days with enough to do. The lessons are not well planned, and the way they are presented do not lend to a predictable and stable environment. Speaking of stability,... many staff are lacking this vital element. Patience is lacking, too. I see a neglect to remember that the students we have need extra instructions, not to mention specialized instructional delivery.   So, art is the focus, but not really. The kids love and hate art. They cannot be happy with the process. Self esteem is so damaged that they can't handle producing something that could be seen, and scrutinized, by others. Some of the students have great skill in art, but others refuse to do it, or even try. If they do try, they will end up tearing the project, or throwing it away. They make sure to destroy it.    I have, in the past, saved art from some of the students. I see it as a window to their minds and hearts. Pictures tell stories, color, size, shading.etc   I wish I could do some art with the students, but I need to be focused on preventing inappropriate behavior. So, I do.  ***Todays Happenings***   *Window breaker surely gone. Ye, right. I believe it when it happens.   *New student real rude and nasty to peers. ..trying to annoy peers and staff.

Two of them got engaged over the weekend!   *gotta go
