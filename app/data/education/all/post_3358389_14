Just an email i got.. some thoughts for you guys.. since many of you are falling into it..  For all you people who say, "I love you" when you have no clue what love is exactly!!!  Something to ponder upon...   Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing and is your voice caught within your chest??  -It isn't love, it's LIKE.   You can't keep your eyes or hands off of her/him  -It isn't love, it's LUST.   Are you proud, and eager to show her/him off??  -It isn't love, it's LUCK.   Do you want her because you know she's/he's there??  -It isn't love, it's LONELINESS.   Are you with her/him because it's what everyone wants??  -It isn't love, it's LOYALTY.   Are you with her because she/he kissed you, or held your hand?  -It isn't love, it's LOW CONFIDENCE.   Do you stay for her/him confessions of love, because you don't want to hurt her/him?  -It isn't love, it's PITY.   Do you belong to her/him because the sight of her/him makes your heart skip a beat??  -It isn't love, it's INFATUATION.   Do you pardon her faults because you care about her/him?  -It isn't love, it's FRIENDSHIP.   Do you tell her/him every day she is the only one you think of?  -It isn't love, it's a LIE.   Are you willing to give up all of your favorite things for her sake? -It isn't love, it's CHARITY.   =================================================  Does your heart ache and break when she's sad?  -Then it's LOVE.   Do you cry for her/his pain, even when she's/he's strong?  -Then it's LOVE.   Do her/his eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? -Then it's LOVE.   Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you to her/him?  -Then it's LOVE.   Do you accept her/his faults because it's a part of who she/he is?  -Then it's LOVE.   Are you attracted to others, but stay with her/him faithfully without regret??  -Then it's LOVE.   Would you give her/him your heart, your life, your death??  -Then it's LOVE.   Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why do we love? Why is it all we search for in life?  This pain, this agony?  Why is it all we long for?  This torture, this powerful death of self?  Why?  The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE.  It is such an addictive thing that even people who are not having it wish to experience it and share it with others as well.
