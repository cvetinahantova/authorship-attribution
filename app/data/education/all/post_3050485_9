the exam yesterday was quite a surprise. one need not study the provisions or cases, one simply should know a bit of literature and philosophy, plus, of course, a flair for writing. fortunately, i think at least i have a knack for those.  i wrote 14 pages in single space for my answer. it was a treatise i know. but then the question in the exams were themselves long and literary(sic). in short, it was an essay, an exposition of one's view, a polemic of sorts, which, honestly i enjoyed because i did not memorize. well, it is now done and over with so i have to study for my other subjects.  what grade will i get, que sera sera.  i am now again in the library. i decided to come here because the sight of my bed is too inviting to resist. at least here, i hope i am right in this, i could resist closing my eyes. anyway i just have to make the most of out of it and do my best.  funny that the question in poli centered around a certain character whose name was quixote. maybe gorospe has a running battle against his "own percieved" windmills. i wonder who is his appointed amuse?   :) interesting.
