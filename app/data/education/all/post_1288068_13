The last two days have been spent on my knees, sweating and swearing like a woman possessed. For normal people, the word 'exhibition' conjures up an image of a clean white room and aesthetically stimulating artistic treats to drink wine in front of whilst nodding at a man in a cravat. For we grubby underachieving art-trained, it is another word for 'sweaty, panicked, sleep-deprived, laborious hell on a stick.'  Um, where was I? Yes. We have been setting up an exhibition of our pupils' work to be assessed by the external examiner. You'd think this would be fairly easy for a bunch of creative types with more sticky fixers than you can shake a metre stick at, but you'd be wrong  -  factoring in extreme exhaustion and greenhouse-level temperatures, we all became very slow and ham-fisted. Works were hung squint, boards fell off walls, portfolios were sticky-fixered to the floor and strops were had all over the place. Sigh.  Never mind. It's all over now and they are assessing as we speak. I'm sure it will be fine, assuming the spray mount hasn't given up the ghost entirely. The private view is tomorrow, which should be fun. Wish I had invited more people.  The most anti-climactic thing about all these exhibiting, interviewing and skills-getting achievements is that it is STILL not over. Jesus. Back to school tomorrow. Next on my agenda are standards and files and the KS3 essay, which is like the promised land of PGCE course work. Starting to doubt I will ever see it.  How many days left in the sidebar..?  x
