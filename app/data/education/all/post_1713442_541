urlLink Survey Professionals Using Electronic Surveys. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Shannon, David M., Johnson, Todd E., Searcy, Shelby and Lott, Alan.  It reviews how survey professionals use electronic survey resources.  From the ERIC Digest:  While an extensive body of literature exists regarding the principles of survey design and the factors influencing response to mail and telephone surveys, the applicability of this literature to electronic surveys is not yet clear. We know, for example, the importance of the first question in mail and telephone surveys, as well as the grouping and sequencing of questions, establishing a respondent-pleasing vertical flow of items in the survey, and having clear, specific directions. The literature also shows the importance of prenotification of respondents, personalized cover letters, incentives, return postage, and multiple contacts to reach respondents and generate higher response rates. Are these factors also important in electronic surveys?   This Digest summarizes the results of a survey administered to the American Educational Research Association's Survey Research Special Interest Group regarding the use of electronic surveys and discusses their responses within the context of the existing literature base. Topics addressed include conditions under which the use of e-mail or web-based surveys would be most appropriate, sampling issues, weaknesses of the approach, and guidelines for other researchers who plan to use email or the Internet for survey research projects.
