I just ate a satsuma, and then found that the  inside  of the peel was mouldy. The significance of this is threefold:  1) It's bloody peculiar. 2) It means I just ate mould. 3) It's pretty much in keeping with the mood of my day so far.   I FORGOT ABOUT THE CONCERTINA BOOK! How could I let this happen? My carefully planned schedule of wedding things and standards and mounting for exhibitions and collecting work is all to shit in a wheelbarrow. It all goes to show that quite frankly, my head is not in the game right now. The summer has begun, and the little man who works the levers in my head is clearly on holiday, his post abandoned in favour of footie and cricket and beer garden fun. I can't blame him, but it does leave the rest of me rather exposed, if, just for instance, I have to take charge of thirty-odd rebellious teenagers for an hour and forty minutes at a time. But of course,  that  will never happen, right?  Congratulations to those of you who braved the Death Clock but I just can't face it. What if it tells me I'm going to pop off next week? I was holding out for a dignified heart attack at around eighty not out, followed by some hurried cryogenic procedures and a prolonged, Futurama-style head-in-a-jar renaissance, allowing me to teach A-level in space to sixth-formers with more tentacles than I would have teeth remaining. If this doesn't prove to be the case, I will be sorely miffed, if not sorely missed.  Concertina book. Shit.  *Breaks down and weeps*
