Oh, doth I hear thoust dearest ship call my name? 5 days until we leave. This is a very exciting time ofr me. I am wearing new shoes.  My mother and I went shopping yesterday and I bought 3 pairs of shoes, one bag, a polo shirt, and hoodie and earplugs. All things essential to my happiness in 5 days.   Now, I will take the time to share with you my admiration of the dollar theatre. The dollar theatre is a great place to be. If you didn't catch a showing in the real theatre, wait a month and pay a buck fifty to see that movie. If you go matinee it's only a dollar, and on Tuesdays, it's only 50 cents all day. I have seen 2 movies there this summer; Starsky & Hutch and 50 First Dates. For just a small sacrafice of theatre size and no dolby or DTX sound, you get what you want, before you rent it from Blockbuster. Alas, I was going to go there today but didn't because my dumb brother didn't want to. Grr Argh. Wait, I have a Drivers License, I can go by myself. Later Suckas!
