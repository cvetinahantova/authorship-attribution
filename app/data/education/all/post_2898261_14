Based on a dream    Hear Me   Prayers uttered Alone I tremble Here in firelight Within your temple  Going crazy here Going insane A wicked twist Lost within pain  Labyrinth controlling  Lost in my maze A jaded worshiper Stuck in a pious daze  I hope for answers Prayers screamed aloud Incense burning I’m falling down  Hold me now Don’t leave me alone I lay upon the floor I’m growing cold
