Well, I haven't been so great about keeping up here...vacation is part of why I haven't posted, but no excuses really other than that. Am working on  a large Seattle/Home post. Ah well.  You can really learn a lot about yourself by looking through your cd's. I've been doing a lot of that the past two days. In the process of uploading songs from my cd colleection to my computer, I've discovered that my favorite type of music must be "adult alternative/contemporary" (that is according to real1player of course), and my favorite band must be Blessid Union of Souls considering I have so many of their cd's and have chosen to upload so many of their songs. I've also learned that my cd collection is incredibly out of date...a lot of 1995-1999. Apparently I stopped buying cd's when I came to college. Hmmm...wonder why?
