troy just got fired! duuuuude!  that was the weirdest episode of apprentice yet.  when my two favorite players (troy and kwame) went to the boardroom, i was like "duuuude"... they did end on good terms though instead of fighting over something petty like lots of the characters have been doing... now that it's down to 4, i'm totally pulling for kwame, but we'll see.  the end.
