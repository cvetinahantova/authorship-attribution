i had to go through a selection process. kiai was very critical to passing the selection. in the beginning i thought that race gender and physical conditioning would tip the balance of the selection and i would not get in. but peter sansei proved me wrong. the skc proved me wrong. it was one of those days that you were happy that you were wrong for once.
