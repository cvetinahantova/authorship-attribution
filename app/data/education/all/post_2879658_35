Well, last week I was invited to attend the enkai for all of the sports coaches at Shiogama Boys.  While I was a little confused as to why I was invited (obviously don't work with any of the sports teams and no english teachers were going to be there), I decided it would be a fun night and a good opportunity to practice my Japanese.  So...on Friday night I walked to a yakiniku (korean barbecue) restaurant on the other side of Shiogama.  I was then greeted by the kocho sensei (principal) and kyoto sensei (VP) and headed inside.  I was the only English teacher there and was therefore doing most of the communicating in Japanese.  Nitanai-sensei (one of the female teachers) arrived and sat next to me since she and I hang out a lot and were the only two females there.  I had the kyoto sensei to my left and the kocho sensei directly across from me.  For two hours we ate lots of meat and drank lots of alcohol.  I told them I was only going to drink a little as I had a weekend of soccer practice but they didn't want to let that happen.  For two hours different senseis came over and chatted with me about everything and anything inviting me to attend all sorts of sporting events or just to try a couple of them to see what they are like.  At enkais you tend to get a lot of invitations with very little follow through because there exists the rule of enkais stating that anything that is said or goes on should never be brought up again.  This isn't always upheld especially when a foreigner is involved.  Everything we do and say tends to be brought up again but they are all worry free because you don't talk about enkais after...craziness I tell you! So, when the two hours ended, I found my way to Danola's apartment where she and Jemma had been having their own little party.  Definitely an entertaining evening...
