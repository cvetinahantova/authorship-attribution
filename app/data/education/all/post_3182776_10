You know that scene in  Alien  where Ripley's running down the corridor in the Nostromo near the end and suddenly she  comes to a junction, and she just  knows  that the alien is there around the corner. So she's there, pressed against the wall, pouring sweat, and the xenomorph is also there, drooling and hissing like a motherfucker and looking at Jonesy in the cat box, and it's just the most terrifying thing you've ever seen in your life.  Well, that about sums up today for me. There's a big, scary, hectic college/school/work monster just around the corner, and my flame thrower is running low on gas, but I'm gonna have to face it down, cos the ship is set for self destruct, and I only have eight weeks to reach minimum safe distance...  Grab the coolant and run for the lifeboat, people. It's back to college tomorrow and at the University of Greenwich,  everyone  can hear you scream...
