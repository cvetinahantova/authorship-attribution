urlLink  Information Literacy Toolkit  Here is another good book on information literacy that school librarians should check out.  This is a review from  School Library Journal :  "The move from textbook to resource-based learning has created a new way of thinking about research skills for both librarians and teachers. This book provides three levels of information-literacy proficiency, and presents a process approach to teaching skills. Reading the national school-library standards is the beginning, but implementation requires planning, and this book provides the tools to achieve this transformation. An accompanying CD-ROM allows librarians to create a comprehensive, cohesive, and sequentially developed school-based information-literacy program. It allows librarians to enter teachers' names, units to be planned, and dates. Part one defines the six stages of the information-literacy process and shows the progression of skills for each stage across grade levels. Part two focuses on individual grades. It can provide the basis for collaboration between librarians and teachers. The systematic planning is one method for determining that all skills are covered for each grade level. Part three includes the teaching tools applicable across grade and curriculum units. Photocopying is permitted for use within a school, providing that the publisher's source line appears on each page. A must for school librarians."
