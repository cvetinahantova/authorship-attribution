I know I've been far from you recently, but I was just trying to find the truth out. I didn't succeed. My blog isn't going anywhere but I've realised that I do need you. May every word I ever speak to you be true and from my heart. I want to love you like other do. I feel nothing for you Lord, but I really need you to be there. I am a nasty kid I know. I wish I could love you. I wish I could. Please help me.
