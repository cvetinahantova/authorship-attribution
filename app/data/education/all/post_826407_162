Got some of my Photos from Profile back yesterday.  I've just put the best ones on our Fotoblog  urlLink here.   After that I spent a good hour or so looking through other peoples Fotoblogs, great way to spend a Saturday morning. Helen has just got back from the hairdressers with a very cool new haircut. Term is over, two weeks holiday. Sun is shining. Connect tonight and holy week starting tomorrow.   Life is good right now!
