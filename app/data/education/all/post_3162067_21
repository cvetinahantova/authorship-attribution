Good God, I'm famished. Think it's time to turn on the oven and cook up some ultra-fattening ciabatta bread! Well, I got home from Exeter about 2 hours ago. I think the journeying really took it out of me: i was very pained on the way home and just got in a taxi from the bus station to take me straight home. Si went to his dad's to email his cv to a few people. I'm exhausted now, but have taken some painkillers too. Ken Dodd was very funny. Me, Si, mum and nan went to see him perform in Torquay last night. He was really very good, but I couldn't laugh too much because it hurt! His show went on for so long! It was 2 and a half hours before the interval. We'd heard that the show would go on until about 1am, but none of us could stand sitting there for so long, and I was in agony, so we went home. It was already about 10.30pm by this point. The drive home was a bit scary. There was so much mist and fog that at times I was a little...anxious, shall we say (no disrespect to mum's driving skills.) Those winding, leaf-covered roads...I could well imagine that at any time we might drive out of the mist and find ourselves in 1952, like Brigadoon. Si and I spent all too short a time with the family before coming back today. We mooched around Exeketer for a few hours and Si had to use all of his skills to prevent me from buying an army of mice (sooo cute and scruffy). I doubt Dervel would have appreciated the competition anyway. Spoilsport. I did, however, buy a skirt from monsoon, which now means I have a whole ensemble. Hurrah!
