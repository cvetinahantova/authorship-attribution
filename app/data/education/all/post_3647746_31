A recent dialogue with my 6.75-year old son:   son: Dad, my friend said that it's illegal to light fireworks on a day that's not the 4th of July on Vashon Island.  hjm: Well, your friend's just a little off there.  It is illegal here in Bellingham, but not everywhere.  I think your friend's just acting like he knows everything.  son: Yeah.  hjm: Don't you think it would be boring to know everything?  There would be no mystery to life.  son: Yeah, but it could be useful.  (pause, holding back a chuckle, followed by immense pride and adoration)  hjm: True.  Still, I think it would get boring.  son: Yeah, like for detectives.  They wouldn't have any mysteries to solve.
