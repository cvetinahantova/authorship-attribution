urlLink Loving Woman    This one's from one of the first rock bands I ever listened to,  urlLink Rata Blanca .   (translated from the original Spanish score)  [ Walter Giardino/AdriaÂ¡n Barilari ]  I feel the heat of your skin On my body again Fleeting star, ignite my thirst Mysterious woman  With your sensual love, how much you give me Make my dream become a truth Give me your soul today, do the ritual Take me to the world where I can dream  Ohh... I must know if truly In some place you are I am going to look for a sign, a song  Ohh... I must know if truly In some place you are Only the love that you give me, will help me  Towards the dawn your image fades Mysterious woman You left in me total lust Beautiful and sensual  Godless heart, give me a place In that warm, almost unreal world I will have to look for a sign On that path you walk  Ohh... I must know if truly In some place you are I am going to look for a sign, a song  Ohh... I must know if truly In some place you are Only the love that you give me, will help me  Your presence marked love in my life... I know it It is difficult to think about living without you Godless heart, give me a place In that warm, almost unreal world  Ohh... I must know if truly In some place you are I am going to look for a sign, a song  Ohh... I must know if truly In some place you are Only the love that you give me, will help me
