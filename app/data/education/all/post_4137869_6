Dear Journal,             ...  Okay, got a letter today...  It’s from Donnie dumb fuck!  I just finished a 5-page letter to Kimberly telling her about it (amongst other things).  I’ll probably copy his letter into here, so that when I look back I won’t have to study each freaking’ word for 5 minutes (sucky ass spelling and handwriting).  But 1st here’s the short version:   I’m sorry I haven’t been there for you and Jonathan.  My head wasn’t in the right place.  It is now.  When I get out of prison, July 2003, I’m going to get a job and start sending you some money.  (BTW, he’s in prison for probation violation).  How does $250.00 sound each month?  Please forgive me.  Children need a mom and a dad.  I want to be able to do father and son things with Jonathan.  Please write back to me.  Can you send some pictures of Jonathan to me?              In my letter to Kimberly, it was more in-depth; plus, I told her about Jeremy, the boys’ birthdays and party etc.  I’ll try to get that letter in later.  P.S.  The carton of cigarettes I just finished lasted from March 27th to April 11th.  That’s pretty good, huh?
