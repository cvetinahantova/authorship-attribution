so...i'm just about to head off to drew's families house to petsit/housesit for 10 days.  amber, drew, and drew's family left for spain today.  i'm jealous...they will have so much fun.  not that i won't, but i wish i was going to spain.  spring break was nice...although coming back after relaxing hit me like a train.  i'm so incredibly exhausted.  each day i'm getting better though.  i'll be back off and on the next few days.  i'm hoping to get some reading done and such.  i have a barnes & noble giftcard from kurt for christmas so i might as well use it and get myself something good to read.  i'm going to miss sleeping with my new down comforter...it's so cozy.  maybe i'll end up bringing it over there.  alright, well i was going to right more...like about my coffeeshop excursion and such but i will have to write about that next time...from now until then....
