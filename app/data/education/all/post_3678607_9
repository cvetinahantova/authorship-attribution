Pros: I'm leaving in 3 days           Honey-Nut Cheerios are the best thing on the planet           I dreampt about West Virginia and my parents being in Mexico           It's not too hot right now  Cons: That stupid rabbit on that Counting Crows song needs to die            My brother is still alive            My back hurts            I complain too much...
