urlLink Law-Related Education and Delinquency Prevention. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Michelle Parrini.  It examines ways that students can be educated about delinquency.  From the ERIC Digest:  Evidence from research/evaluation studies indicates that the principles underlying law-related education (LRE) programs address the factors that put youth at risk for delinquency. Although rigorous evaluations of LRE are limited, what evidence exists suggests that LRE has potential to prevent delinquency and problem behavior (Caliber 2002). This Digest discusses (1) the connection between LRE and delinquency prevention, (2) the impact of successful LRE on delinquency prevention, and (3) future directions of LRE programs that address delinquency.
