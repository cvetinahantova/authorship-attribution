Today I learned, once again, that my problems are not that bad.  I don't want to compare to others, but some people really have some huge issues to deal with.  Still, I 've got to keep in mind, on a daily basis, what is important...there is only God and his will for us is to recognize that our essence is joy...the same universally.  I'm learning to be awake and ready in mind/body/spirit and feel the wholeness of my being.
