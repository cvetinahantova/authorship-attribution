I have to say, I have done nothing of interest today.  Not washed a dish, made a bed, nothing.  That said,  I finished The Teeth of the TIger by TOm Clancy today.  I love Tom, my dear hubby turned me onto him when we were first married.  His first books were, well, lets say, too techinical for me.  But the last few have been more personality oriented, and I have enjoyed them.  This last one, so far is tied with Rainbow Six as my favorite of his.    I do that sometimes, get so into a book, that I have to drop everything else until it is finished.  I remember staying up until 6am when I was in high school, reading.  I used to be such a voracious reader.  Now, I spedn my time reading recipes, food labels, monthly bills, baseball schedules...there is no end to the reading I do, jsut none of it is for my own pleasure.
