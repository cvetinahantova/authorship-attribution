If you are an American visiting Australia, you will undoubtedly be asked one somewhat simple question: "Are you from Canada?"   The first few times this happens, you smile politely and say "No sorry, I'm from Ohio", or whatever the case may be. This part of the verbal exchange is fine, really. It is what comes next that now (after 5 years in the country!) starts my blood boiling.   The kind hearted Australian who inquired as to your nationality will then qualify their question with a statement such as "Oh, I thought perhaps you were American, but I just can't take a chance. If you ask a Canadian if they are American, boy do they get mad!".   Ok, the first few times I heard this explanation I smiled, laughed, and in general brushed it off. It was only after hearing it ALL the time, from various sorts of people, that it really began to grate on me. I mean really, do you think Americans love to hear how Canadians can't stand to be associated with us? Do you truly believe we need to know how insulted people from our neighboring country would be to be mistaken for "a Yank"?   Honestly, I love Canada. Having lived the majority of my life near the Canadian border, I visited the country often and have several dear friends there. I have asked those friends just what they thought of the whole predicament, and yes indeed, they really would be insulted if someone incorrectly thought they were from the US. Alright, I can accept that - country pride, and all.   But can't anyone in this vast world of ours see how it could be somewhat insulting to be told over and over again that a fellow human being would be utterly offended if they were mistaken as a person from your country?!?!   I just can't wait to ask the next Australian I meet if they are from New Zealand.
