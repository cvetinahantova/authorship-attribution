SEX and THE CITY!!!      Haha!  Don't get too excited and get your mind out of the gutter.  Well, Saturday night was designated a movie night at my apartment so most of the day was spent cleaning (well the first half was sleeping as I was a little tired).  The number of attendees had dropped and so it was a quaint group consisting of me, Steph and Kristel.  With Sex and the City in my dvd player, Pizza Hut pizza delivered promptly, and a little bailey's and icecream, the night was a ton of fun and a nice change of pace.  We actually watched the entire season 5 and when it ended Steph and Kristel realized they missed their train home and would have to taxi it back.  Luckily they live only 10 minutes away!  So yea, a nice end to a crazy week.
