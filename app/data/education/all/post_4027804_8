::sits down quietly, listening to his music::  Hm...relationship troubles? Heh, who cares? Are ya gettin married? Thought so, so quit complaining and just have fun.  Ties have been broken, new ones made; has he finally severed his past? Or, has his past threads been needling on a path to a new quilt? My story of time, I'm going to make it one I can look back on and say..."I don't regret that, because I wanted to do it." With each their own way of living, I'm gonna have a fun way for mine. ::smirks::  Fun people; I sure will have a rough time, but when you think about it, at the end of the day, who cares about what you do but yourself and the ones you are with? Fun time...I'll have a fun time with a few people I know as well. Fun? It doesn't bother me anymore. I just go through it without much of a care, amused with it all.  Fun...it doesn't bother me anymore; I am just writing my own story of time, and finding my own cares along with it.  As for what all this has with my title? Not a damn thing.
