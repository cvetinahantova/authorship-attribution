I am posting info on my tea purchases.  I first purchased the black sampler from Adagio Teas.  I got a Ceylon, a Yunnan and a Keemun. Very fast delivery.  I also got the single brew pot that comes with it.  I fell in love with the Ceylon.   For my first teaswap I got tea from Teavanna - Order was a little screwy because I ordered two packages of the Lady Earl Gray.  They sent it in one batch.  That's ok, just confusing.  I also ordered tons of tins to send the tea in.  I barely had enough to go around.  Then for my second teaswap - the Valentines one I ordered a caramel creme brulee from Tealuxe - delicious AND their Aphrodisiac tea- Again, I barely had enough to go around.  So, I ended up getting a gift certificate from them for my first order and I bough myself from of the caramel creme brulee and some of their creamy earl gray.    I like the creme brulee the best.  Then for subscribing to a newsletter through Enjoying Tea, they gave me a gift certificate also.  I bought some Keemun - outta this world!  I am finding I like black teas.  For my third springtime swap I bought from Haney and Sons - the Lemony Green Gunpowder and the Vanilla black.
