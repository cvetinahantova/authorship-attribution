Nothin' tastes better than cold microbrew on a hot day, and that's what we got at the Bite. The wineries were also out in force doing their pretty good thing, and even Budweiser was there claiming it uses Willamette Valley hops. I stuck to my favorite Widmer all the same. We took the venerable Yellow Line down to Waterfront Park and joined the throngs for some excellent King salmon in Pinot Gris huckleberry sauce, some fondue in a tiny bread bowl (from a German restaraunt called the "Berlin Inn" that claims it will hosting "Barktoberfest" in a few weeks), some very tasty Marionberry pie and some excellent zydeco. It's all about "Brand Oregon" this year, and berries were represented very well. It's so good!   I swear I've never seen so many Hawaiian shirts. Don't know why other than this is an attempt to suggest it's party time. I wish summer here could last forever.
