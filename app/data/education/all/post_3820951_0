i got a testimonial in my friendster account from a former staff in the lasallian newspaper today...then all of a sudden, it just hit me that i really miss working in the org...corny as it may sound to other people, i really found myself in the lasallian...my passion for writing really bloomed with tls and most of my friendships were formed there as well...gosh...truly miss the paper...=(
