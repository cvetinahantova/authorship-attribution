Each day reminds how deeply I must commit myself, no devote myself, my entire being to the ongoing transformation to a spirit filled existence.  I'm far from perfect.  In fact, I'm likely to make mistakes, but if I allow those mistakes to be learning experiences then I have done my part in growing into a new way of life.  If I keep making the same mistakes over and over again, then I have little to offer anyone, including myself.    My heart is continuing to open, my body continues to change with age, my mind continues to play tricks on me...but the more I focus on God, on incorporating christ-consciousness into my daily moment by moment living, then I know I am on the right path.
