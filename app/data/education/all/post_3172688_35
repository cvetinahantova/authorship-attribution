Hey... I have two little notes that I wrote today that I wanted to post on here. I will get to that later, but for right now, I will talk about my day. It has been a  long  day. And how can it not be, with summer so close. Some kids are already out. Most Seniors are, but I'm still lower class so I don't get that privilege. Right now is kind of weird, though. Everyone is yelling and slamming doors like always. It all seems to be towards my sister to.  Oh god I'm going to blow. I don't mind when my parentâ€™s yell, but when they yell in front of my little niece that I get  very  angry... I can't stand this!! Every other word that comes out of my dad's mouth is a cuss-word  right  in front of the baby. I have herd all of this crap my whole life and I  wont  stand it being yelled while she is the room. I just came from downstairs. While I was down there, they were yelling at my sister in the kitchen so loud that I had to shake the baby-rattle twice as hard just to drown it out. Even that didn't work, but it kept the baby happy while her mom was getting cussed out.  Then  they all came out into the living room where the baby and mey were at! I couldn't believe it! At first they were semi-quiet, then they started there yelling and cursing wars again! I got so angry that I started shaking and I had to get out of there. I couldn't yell at them, what good would that do? Make them angrier and start yelling at me? That would be twice as worse for the baby. So I left quietly and hoped that they stopped yelling.  Now the wars have quieted down a little. I can still hear my parents cursing foul words in their room, but at least it's not where the baby can hear. I do see where my parents are coming from though. My sister only attended 56 minutes of school out of the required 8 hours.  Anyways I'm going to post my writings later... For now I'm going for a walk.
