Ummm, I don't know.  I don't want to write today.  Three things quick: I did manage to wander down to Freak Lunchbox, it turns out that no, Jake was not working today.  Alicia was even with me today, and she was going to force me to talk to him... but no luck.  At least I got to buy some boysenberries - which I probably would have been too embarassed to do if he was working.  I will use candy to console me.  And I apprear to be caught in some kind of alternate dimension or something, because the number of people who think Halifax is great far out number the people who think it is shit.  Namely me.  How can this be?  I don't understand.  No wonder I have no friends - I am a complete alien to these people (and they are aliens to me). I am starting to question whether I truly speak the local language... I appear to, but I am suspicious.  Finally, speaking of my lack of friends, I have lost Joe.  I mean, I set him down for one minute, and he is gone.  I don't know where his head is at, but he has dropped off the face of the planet, and I don't know what to do.  I am a fag-hag without her fag.  And I am really sad about it... I don't know what is going on.  I am going to try to remedy things tonight, but I think Joe thinks there is nothing that needs remedying, he is just tired and wants to nap.  Like he has been doing for two weeks.  What the fuck is going on?  I have no idea.
