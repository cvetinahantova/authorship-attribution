A couple of girls trying to catch goldfish at the Noaetsu Matsuri, a summer festival in which floats are pulled through the sreets by rowdy men and women on their way to the temple where they drop off bags of sake, rice and fruit.      The view as we cross the sreet from our hotel in Tokyo, the Keio, hence all the whities.  I just read in the news that two 20-something caucasian boys got naked and jumped off a high balcony there.  Glad they waited a week and half until we had checked out to commit suicide.
