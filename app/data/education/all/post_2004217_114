Sigh. It's sad, isn't it? Blogging not because you want to display your thoughts to the world, but because you don't feel like you have anyone else. And I'm not saying that because it's late, but because I actually feel as if this is the only place that's available, the only place that won't say "Sorry, gtg byeeeeeee" when I need it most. Everyone else has lives; friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, exciting things to do, and they never seem to have time for me anymore. All I need is a hug and for someone to spend some time with me because they're my  friend , not because they're in my base group or aren't allowed to behave "exclusively".  Maybe I'm listening to too much Morrissey...  Ceff x   They said they respect me, which means their judgement is crazy
