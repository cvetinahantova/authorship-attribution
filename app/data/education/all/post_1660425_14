Recall the last difficult problem that you had to solve. Did you solve it alone, or did you solicit the help of others? What did you learn from solving that problem? Can that learning be used again?   I like to listen to others.  I do, however, like to make my own decision.  For example, I had to make a career choice earlier this year.  I had an opportunity to take a job at RHS instead of staying at my current position at RJHS.  I asked advice from family, friends, co-workers, etc.  I took all of their advice and put it together to help me make my decision.  I knew this would be a choice I would have to live with for the next 15 to 20 years so it weighed heavy on my mind for nearly a week.  It is stressful to have to carry a large burden for a long period of time.  What did I learn from that??  That your gut reaction is almost always correct.  Can I use that again...sure.  As long as I am rational about my decisions and make clear and just choices, I can use my gut reaction to be an indicator to me in the future.  BC
