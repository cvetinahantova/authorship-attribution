dude, i wish life were like monopoly and you could just buy up the places that charge you money and earn from it.  amanda asked me like a month ago if i could please keep my door shut when i'm not going through it to save power, so although i like my door open, i've been shutting it 99% of the time any more, and keeping the heat down a little lower, etc.  we got our feb utilities bill (gas, electric, whatever) yesterday and i just opened it... it's 150% of the last bill she freaked out about and i've been making an effort to be good!  i am  not  looking forward to her coming home and seeing it... i didn't do it, i've been practicing better power habits for the last month, as per her request, and it still went up.  frankly, i don't think $130 in a month is a bad price to heat the size place we're in, especially when it's as chilly as it's been around here... some small snow in the forecast this week, but hopefully it'll warm up enough soon that we can just turn the heat off and not stress about this.  time to get some work done and brace myself for the inevitable confrontation... joy.
