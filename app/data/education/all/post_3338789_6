Well. I had a fun weekend. Sort of.  But. Tomorrow, school starts. Yes, that was a short summer vacation, wasn't it?  I am taking a class at a local school that I have already taken but that I have to take to keep my emergency teaching license. It meets every Monday and Wednesday from 8-12 from now until the first part of August.  I'm NOT looking forward to getting up before 7am twice a week just to take this silly class but there's not much I can do.  In other news...  I have some NASTY looking bug bites. I'm not sure exactly what I did or how they got there, but I believe they're spider related...View the horror:   urlLink My nasty bites...   It's gotten so bad now that it actually hurts to move my left side (that picture's taken in the mirror-reverse image).  I can't bend over, I can't stretch, and I can't turn.  I hope this doesn't last forever. (PS-like my flowered PJ shorts??)  Went to one of J's friend's weddings yesterday. He's an old college buddy and BOY did we feel out of place!  We left the reception (that had started at 5) just after 7pm and dinner. :)  Hm. Not much else to report.  I hope that this 4 hour class isn't as boring as I think it's going to be and I certainly hope they give us breaks or at least let us have food to eat while we're there.  So. Until later...toodle-oo :)
