MONDAY  Today was a great day! I met up with my friend at the gym at 6am and worked out until 7am got ready and was at work by 8:15am. The day went well, although I was sore from yesterday's workout. I was upset though because during lunch break I went to get a refund for a parking permit I had purchased $44.00 because I didn't need it anymore since our bosses provided us with some. I went to go get a refund and the people were not being gracious they were trying to give me back $22.00 when the pass was never used. According to them it was policy that they don't give a full refund but I thought the way they handled the situation was very unjust. I ofcourse tried to manage the situation and my temper. To end it short I didn't get my refund and I ended up leaving before I said some mean things. I talked to my boss and she said she was going to try to figure things out. I pray this gets resolved. After work my friend and I headed over to the gym for aerobics class. Tuesday the class is a hip hop class. I thought it was going to be aerobics exercises to hip hop music but it was totally different. The instructor taught us a whole dance routine. It was pretty embarrasing but we learned and he was being really patient with us. Overall it was fun and we got a good workout. Tomorrow's class is Kung Fu and Thursdays is kickboxing well see how it goes.  As soon as we got out of the gym we headed home. I drove to my house to take a quick shower and pick up a dvd I borrowed from my friend to return and headed over to Pasadena to meet up with my prayer/book group. It ended up just being 3 of us Celena, Lisa and I. It was a blessed time. We chatted and prayed for one another. This time is awesome and I thank God for it. After the meeting I raced home to see my parents. They came back today like around 9pm. They were excited to see me and I was too. They gave me some gifts they brought back and talked a little about their trip. Thank YOU God for bringing them back safe and for providing them with the vacation.
