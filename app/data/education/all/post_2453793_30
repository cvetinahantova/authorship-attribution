i hate sleep...i have no good dreams, so whats the use?  nothing... it's just a waste of time.  i've had insomnia for a good 2 weeks now.  i blame it on my job and one of my roommates.   "lids down, i count sheep i count heartbeats the only thing that counts is that i won't sleep i countdown, i look around  who needs sleep? well you're never gonna get it who needs sleep? tell me what's that for who needs sleep? be happy with what you're getting"
