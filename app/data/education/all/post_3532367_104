I completed the wireless network after finishing work today. It took a couple of hours, slightly longer than planned, as I had to remove a virus off the laptop the customer was using. The money paid for the parts and the extra (profit) went to the next door neighbour for the work he had done to his car, after I had put a dent in his wing last year. Easy come, easy go, but al least it was another debt busted!  Sandra says that money will be tighter than she had originally thought as we still have to pay off the overdrafts and her credit card. Lets hope the mortgage rate doesn't go up any more.
