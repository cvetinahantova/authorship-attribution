Comparing Bush I to Bush II  "But Saddam Hussein survived the Gulf War while his nation's children starved from Western sanctions. Osama bin Laden may also flourish, as millions of Afghanis perish."   A time for reflection, not revenge (written days after SEpt 11, 2001)    The desire to retaliate is natural, but before George Bush yields to that emotion, he should stop to consider in whose name he is truly acting.
