Black Entertainment Television's (BET) afternoon music video program,  The Center , offers advice daily on a variety of topics.  A week or two ago I was schooled on the art of proper gift-giving.  Today's pointers focused on back-to-school...  Tip #2: Establish relationships with teachers.  "Ex-tablish relationships wit cho teachers.  Raise yo hand.  Axe queshuns.  Sit up frun.  Talk at them affer class.  Make sho they know yo name.  Being teacher's pet doan hurt no body.  Brown nosin' s'OK, too."   Better advice has never been uttered. The uttering itself could have been better, though.
