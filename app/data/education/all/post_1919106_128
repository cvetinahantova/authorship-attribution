Things I hate when driving   1) Asshats driving at night, on a 6 lane highway with heavy traffic, during snowy/rainy days,  with their high beams on .  1.5) Fucktards with those halogen headlights. Yes, you can see better with them because  they're the equivalent of a normal high beam . Goddammit, I thought I'd go blind. The only exception are the bluish ones - those are actually pretty easy on the eyes. But still worse than a standard headlight.  2) Tailgating asspants. If you want to go faster,  switch to the fucking left lane . Speaking of which... 3) Idiots that drive slowly on the left lane. But they're not as bad as 4) Morons that drive twice the speed limit... On the rightmost lane. Now, this isn't Texas here. There's snow, and ice, and more ice on the roads here in Canadia. I hope they  urlLink slip and impale themselves on a guardrail . 5) Stupid executive bitches on their cellphones in their Acuras and Audis and BMWs (add 1.5 to those too) that cut you off and then slam the brakes.  6) Anyone in a sports SUV.
