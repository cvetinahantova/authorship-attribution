Just back from Sainsbury's, where people with no appreciable spacial awareness, motor skills or co-ordination were having some sort of wager on who could drive their trolleys the most spastically into the island merchandising areas. Jesus. No wonder they have to have those funny rubber bumpers in the fresh produce aisle. Additionally, I hereby promise to drop kick the next lucky toddler who runs into my basket at full tilt then dissolves in hysterical tears at my feet as onlookers are scandalised by my flagrant disregard for the wellbeing of fucking hyperactive children who should be handcuffed to their parents, put in the trolley seat provided or tied up outside the shop so help me God.  In more cheerful news, I am intermittently knitting, making cakes and grumbling at length about the state of the house. Hooray! Also: the Emma! The Emma is coming! Not for ages but I am very very very excited!  Being on holiday is great. x
