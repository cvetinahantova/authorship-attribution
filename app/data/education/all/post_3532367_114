Well a call from the "Mother In Law" suggests we have 3 kids with chicken pox - they all stopped over last night as we went out to the BBQ. A mad rush over there confirmed our 'fears'. They all wanted to stop put for the day, which suited me.  Sandra and I decided to have lunch out - we went to the local supermarket cafe and lunched for 4 quid. Next stop was the bowling alley to drop off a present to a birthday party that Rob was supposed to be going too, but now couldn't.  Following that we decided to look round the local health clubs, very nice but a tad expensive at 45 UKP per month (6 months min) or 30 UKP month at the local public gym (but with 12 month min). Sandra decided a  review of finances was required first - fair enough - neither of the clubs offered a one month trial without committment.  We got back home late in the afternoon - via the garden centre for 12 quids worth of plants - and planted out the front garden. It was quite nice considering the budget! A quick tea and while Sandra went to pick up the kids, I decided to cycle to church for the evening service (not the usual service we do). It was a stand-in to the usual minister, and he was very good, splitting the sermon into 4 parts of 5 mins each.
