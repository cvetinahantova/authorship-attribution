There's an interesting review of a German novel about the 18th-century thinker Lichtenberg in the  Chronicle of Higher Education . The novel,  Lichtenberg and the Little Flower Girl , is by Gert Hoffman.   urlLink   urlLink The Review  urlLink   certainly brings out the clever, witty, insightfulness of Lichtenberg's aphorisms. It puts more of an emphasis on his heterosexuality than I do in my chapter on Lichtenberg's aphorisms in  Warm Brothers . Lichtenberg married a 13 year old (the "little flower girl" of the title), which I think qualifies on some level as queer.
