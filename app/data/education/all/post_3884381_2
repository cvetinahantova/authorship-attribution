Well, Fox Sports Net is debuting a new show this week entitled "The Sports List".  It will most likely be mildly entertaining.  It will definitely be off the air within 3 months.  We all know the current trend (besides thrilling "reality" T.V.) is lists.  Well, if I am not mistaken,  VH1 and ESPN Page 2 has given us every list already.  Why do we need more?      But, having said that, I am not one to buck a trend.  And, since I am not going to have my own reality show soon (unless Fox picks up the hit series "I'm married and faithful to my wife and have no interest in testing that" for a second season), I will give in to the list craze.  Therefore, I declare this the "Week of Lists" on my Blog.  I am sure these lists will spark heated debate among, well, me, myself and I.      So, without further delay...     My Top Ten Favorite Texas Rangers of All Time     1.  Nolan Ryan  2.  Pudge Rodriguez  3.  Pete Incaviglia  4.  Steve Buechele  5.  Buddy Bell  6.  Rafael Palmeiro  7.  Rusty Greer  8.  Richie Zisk  9.  Fergie Jenkins  10.  Frank Tanana     So there you have it.  A list that truly makes no difference in the world.  I have accomplished all that I could have hoped for with it.      Go Strangers.
