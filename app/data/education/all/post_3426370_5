Latly there has been nnothing. School got out last Thursday annd i have plunged. my link. My only way out to theh world the thinng i hate and yet love at the same time is gone. I amm stuck only in my room. I go downstaiirs only to get water. I hardly eat. I can't understand it. I just stay in my room. Nothinng more. I have only been in the way of everything.  my parents don't listen they don't care.  my brother dosenn't ccare. it all sucks. no one listens nno one cares. I have just dug myself alittle hole and layed in it praying for silence Sweet, subtle silence...I havenn't talked mmuch. I give enough souond to know that I amm not mute. nothing I do is good enough. I can onnly hope to talk to Ken. I feel better then. only one who ccan make me smile. thats it. I just feel darkness....Ii am going now....bye....but know this:  life is sweet death is peaceful its the transition I fear.
