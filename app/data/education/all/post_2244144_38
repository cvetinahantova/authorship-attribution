"I currently do not understand why people are left shelter less. It is really a sad debacle in all senses of the words. There is so much sympathy and empathy that I have towards these forlorn individuals that I cannot portray it in an emotional way."  Now that is what I would say if I were some imbecile that does not understand the true meaning of why these people are without a home. The real and truthful reason why these men and women are this way is they are complete and utter fools. There is no other to describe it.  First of all, I must explain myself. I am an upcoming high school senior that desires to become a bum. Now you might be wondering why I would want such a decrepit life. Well it is plain and simple, I am a lazy man. And there is nothing lazier than being a bum.  Now when I grow up and get into the “real world”, the hobos will be doing things very differently. The bums of my generation will be regarded as true champions. We will be, as in the modern lingo, “big pimpin”.  “How are you going to do that?” you may ask. Simple, the homeless people of my era will be habitual thieves. Everything that I steal will be of luxurious quality.  In this modern day and age, whenever people drive by a bunch of homeless people they feel sorry for the person and to some extent feel glad that they are not one of them. Of course, when I become a bum, these same people will admire us.  You will regularly hear such things as, “Holy shit honey, that bum has HDTV.” or “Damn, a Porsche, how does he do it?”  You might be wondering, “What if you get caught for stealing those expensive items.” Well it will involve a simple measure, prison. Now I have created a simple chart of life before and after prison,            OLD BUM WAYS   PRISON LIFE     housing   no home    warm and cozy place to live, even get a bed     income   begging for money   It is all free.     food    a couple pieces of cardboard, maybe   Three meals a day     health   None   Doctors around the clock, since they expect some shit to go down.     sex life   No one wants to sleep with your smelly ass.   Bubba will always love you.        Plus you get the added bonus that the cops may not find out it was you abducting all the materials.  (Actually I wrote this piece before, then I deleted it. It was funnier before.)
