urlLink Understanding Sensory Integration. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by DiMatties, Marie E. and Jennifer H. Sammons.  From the ERIC Digest:  Michael is a third grade student who is waiting for the school bus. He is challenged by sensory experiences during everyday activities that most of us don't even think about. While he's still reeling from the battle with mom over brushing his teeth (that peppermint toothpaste tastes like fire in his mouth) the school bus pulls up. Michael runs past the bus monitor's haze of perfume and sits at the back of the bus. In his heightened state, he becomes even more aware of his new school shirt with its stiff label and that awful feeling like a wire brush being poked into the back of his neck. The sensory experiences of the movement of the bus, the sound of his excited classmates laughing and yelling above the roar of the bus engine all contribute to his increased agitation. By the time Michael arrives at school he is wound up and ready to unravel. There is no time to wait for the bus monitor's direction...getting off the bus quickly becomes a matter of survival and he resorts to pushing, shoving and finally kicking his way out. Unfortunately, there is a price to pay for this seemingly outward aggression...he can expect another trip to the principal's office.   This digest defines sensory integration and sensory integration dysfunction (DSI). It outlines evaluation of DSI, treatment approaches and implications for parents and teachers, including compensatory strategies for minimizing the impact of DSI on a child's life.
