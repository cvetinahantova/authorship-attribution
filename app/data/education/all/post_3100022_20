I was aware that I would be flying over some fairly foreign country, and it was quite rewarding to see them the way I did. What I was not prepared for was the most amazing vistas I saw during the plane journey to London. If you have never seen the kiss of dawns child, upon virgin white clouds that surely must be the stairs to heaven; then there is yet another of life's surprises that; should you ever have the opportunity to see 'must not pass on. It is truly a sight to behold when this is all framed by a backdrop bright twilights stars dancing in the heavens like ruby and sapphire fireflies around a gypsy campfire. Mere words have not the capacity to describe what I have seen. I urge you to see it for yourselves. You can truly appreciate the beauty of a city from a-far especially when you are 12 thousand meters up gazing down on such a city taken by night's darkness, marked only by ten million street lights. Yes plane travel can give you a perspective on things that you may never imagine. The things I saw were not expected and so surreal, and this is why I urge you. Don't forget your sleeping pills.
