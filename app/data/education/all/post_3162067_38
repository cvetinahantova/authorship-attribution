I don't wanna do any housework, I don't wanna do any marking!!! You see, this is why I generally dislike the summer. I'm not really an out-door person and being hot makes me very reluctant to do anything except watch DVDs and eat chocolate. The countdown towards the end of my teaching career has started, and I am feeling sort of wistful (it'll pass haha). My interview date is now on 8th July (which is a bit of a bugger as it means I won't be able to teach my a-level class, but as their exam is over now it will probably be ok). Just had Cilip ring me for an interview (it's a job agency) and the woman seemed really positive. I've also just found another job I want to apply for, so I'll do that now, before it's too late (and my painkillers kick in!) Love to everyone xxxx
