one of the coolest things about madrid was this sheesha place we found.  it was incredible.   Sheesha is this flavored tabacco that you smoke through a big water pipe.  It's this arabic thing.  I first experienced it in Anaheim at this cafe we discovered while going to Biola.  It was called "Al Basha" and was next to a strip club.  It was always filled with old arabic men constantly sucking on these pipes exhaling smike that filled the room.  we'd have mint tea and play dominos.  it's a great place.   They're always playing Al Jazzera Tv or some sweet middle eastern music. Well, this place in Madrid added a cool element to the Shessha.  They mixed whisky into the water.  it was splendid.
