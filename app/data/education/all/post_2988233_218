I have been afc this weekend, (away from computer) and you know what, I missed blogging.  How pathetic is that?  I have a new link fo ryou, this is a brand new blogger, she only has two posts, and would really like to meet new friends, her name is  urlLink Tammy , and we have been friends forever and a day.  In fact, I posted about her  urlLink here .  So make her welcome to the world of blogging.  If her blog is anything like her real life, it will definitly be an interesting read.   Just got to get her warmed up and started.  She has   some   stories to tell.
