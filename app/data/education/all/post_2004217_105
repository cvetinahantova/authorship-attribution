I wonder: Am I unattractive, or have I just not met anyone who thinks I'm attractive?   If it's that I haven't met anyone who thinks I'm attractive, then why do the guys I know not find me attractive?  Maybe they don't find me attractive because they don't like my personality. Or maybe they don't find me attractive because I'm not.  But why? What do the guys I know see in other girls that they don't see in me?  Just a thought.
