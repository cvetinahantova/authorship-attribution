I can't believe we are leaving for  urlLink LT  in two days.  This is my first LT and I am pretty excited.  It helps that pretty much all my friends will be there too.  We just found out recently that we are going because Kyle is playing drums.  The band this year will be sweet. And I'm looking forward to the hot, sunny weather. I am a southern girl living in a northern state (well, I was born in the south, does that count?)  There's a lot to do before we leave.  So much that I probably shouldn't be using my time writing this blog, but oh well.  I began priming my kitchen.  What was supposed to be a three day project is turning out to be much longer.  It took me one day to take off the border and tape the walls.  The day after that I had to sand and start priming.  Today I am hoping to finish the priming, but that probably won't happen.  I will probably finish tomorrow and then leave the painting until after we get back.   We are doing Martini Olive and Simply White in the Kitchen.  And we are also painting the cabinets.  Everyone wants to know why we are painting over brand new oak - it's just not our style.  If anyone wants to explore colors for a room,  urlLink Behr  has a pretty cool website.
