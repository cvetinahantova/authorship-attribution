BUENA VISTA UNIVERSITY IS DOING TECHNOLOGY RIGHT   While at a conference in Atlanta last week, Buck and I met Ed Barboni, a gentleman who works with small Universities and Colleges throughout the nation.  Buck asked, "What schools have you visited that are getting it right?  Who is seemlessly integrating technology onto their campus?"  Ed quickly spat out, "Buena Vista University.  Though they have a lot of money, they are doing everything absolutely right."    Check out the  urlLink Buena Vista University Site .  Buck and I were especially impressed with their  urlLink Tech Department .
