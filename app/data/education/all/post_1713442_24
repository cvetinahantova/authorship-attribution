urlLink The Cult Construction Set    This is a neat site that lets you create your own cult quickly.  It even generates Bible verses to support the beliefs you want to specialize in.   I made a cult called Librarians for Krishna that believes in Polygamy, S&M, and that OJ Simpson is the messiah.  I had no idea that OJ fulfilled so many of the scriptures.    This site showed me the chapters and verses.  It even has tips for how to get your cult started by giving advice on recruiting new members.  I am not sure how this relates to information literacy, but I thought I would share anyway.
