Katy took these pictures when she took the children up to the Goose Creek Recreation Center this last Saturday. They had face painting , games and such.         Tanda lives across the street and is the same age as Kristina.  They go to the same school together and are practically inseperable.       Tanda and Kristina with their faces painted together!       My daughter Kristina with cool face art on her cheek       Kristina writing email to her friend       Sammy and LuLu playing on kitchen floor.  This is their favorite past time....       Can I scratch without you having to take a picture??
