Man I'm worn out.  I don't have much energy to blog in depth so I'll just hit some highlights.  This weekend was rocking.  I was out Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and all were good times.  The highlight was Arabian Nights on Saturday which I'll talk about more later I think.  I leave early on Wednesday morning so I'm making final preperations now.  I have a few more things to do but for the most part I'm ready.  Everyone wish me luck.
