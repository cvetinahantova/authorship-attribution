urlLink SearchMonster.Org  This is another directory of the Web which uses volunteers to help build it.  One problem I see is that only editors get free listings of their sites.  Everyone else has to pay $30.  Won't this skew the directory towards commerical sites?  (Most of the time, searchers aren't looking to buy...) Regardless, I am supportive of all attempts to categorize the Web by human effort.   It really does cut down on spam in search results.    Sample category:   urlLink Reference > Education
