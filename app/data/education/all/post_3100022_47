I was trying to think of a good description of the housing around the area in which I live, after reading  urlLink Rachelles first input ! I was struck dumb by the simplicity of the description that she gave. Sometimes I think too many steps ahead, and latteral thinking is not always linear. Thankyou Chelle!  I live on coronation street, well not literally but very close to the same look and feel of it, but the thing is you can be anywhere in London - perhaps Enlgand and still see the same style of housing: Cramped, dirty and sometimes derilect at some points. But as I said before the area that I am staying in is not so bad. and the street is a lot wider (five lanes) and there are only houses on one side, however you will find that the houses are still quite cramped together in that notoriously english way.
