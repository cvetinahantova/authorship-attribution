The fan beasts have been silenced... somewhat. It's pretty hot stuff, but it unfortunately requires two power supplies, because my 400 w is short a single 4-pin peripheral plug. It's awesome, nonetheless... and now I've got that nifty dashboard thing on the front of my pc.  Anyway, I'm off again.  Current Music: Stray Cats - Stray Cat Strut
