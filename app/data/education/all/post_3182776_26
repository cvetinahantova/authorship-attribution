Phew, what a scorcher! A grand day to have a birthday, I’m saying. My favourite sister is away in far-flung Watford, but today is celebrating her big two-four! Oh. My. God! How did we both get to be so OLD!?!   Anyway, in honour of her inimitable Anna-ness, here’s a special Top Five memories of my Little Sis:  1) When my dad got a little bit over-enthusiastic with the garden swing and catapulted her six feet, chin first onto a concrete path. Tears, blood, stitches, all kinds of recriminations. A shining Bird family moment, I think.  2) When I broke my toy sword by hitting Anna with it, then told Mum that SHE had broken it on purpose. She got confined to bedroom for hours. I got off scot-free. I still feel guilty.  3)  When she used to suck her fingers. Her little finger used to wiggle back and forth, even when she was asleep. Adorable, really.  4) On long car journeys when she used to take all her clothes off and put them on the Polly the doll, who was roughly the same size as she was.  5) I don’t actually remember this, because I was only two at the time, but I think it’s sweet, in a slightly creepy way. Apparently when Anna was born, my Dad brought me to see Mum and her at the hospital, and when I looked into the cot and saw her, I said ‘God bless you little Anna’. Nobody told me to say this apparently, and no-one knows where it came from, especially since we’re not religious in our family at all. Weird, huh? But cute.   Well that was quite embarrassing for both of us, I think. I’ll go now and try to redeem myself by doing some work.  Enjoy the sunshine, people. Get it while you can!
