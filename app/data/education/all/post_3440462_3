urlLink    Well, I'm back.  Instead of the picturesque scene you saw represented below, reality looked more like what you see above.  the weather varied between sprinkling, raining, and snowing (just those three), and the trail had't been maintained in a while.  lots of underbrush grown over the trail, logs to climb over or under, and snow drifts to hide the trail all added up to one soaked christopher by the time I set up my tent (at that point wherever I could find a flat spot big enough).  Chock one up to experience.  there were were two nuggets of wisdom validated on this trip:  Always take a change of clothes to leave in the car for the ride home; and, alway take a roll of (emergency) plastic tape.  The reason for the first one is obvious, the second one was validated this morning when I woke up to six inches of fresh snow that obscured my path the night before.  I would have been bummed if I hadn't marked my trail.  The Lord is good, and there will be other weedends for adventure (like next weekend). Â  urlLink
