I used to believe  When the time is right  Love will come to me   I used to believe  When I love someone  And love him with all my heart  Sincerely  He will love me back   I used to believe  When two persons really love each other  Nothing can ever separate them   I start to question all my beliefs  When love keeps passing me by  When the one I love doesn’t love me back  When a truly loving couple have to be separated    Now….I don’t believe anymore   Now….  I believe in something more powerful that believing  It’s called  Faith…
