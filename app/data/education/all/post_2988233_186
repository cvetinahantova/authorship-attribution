They made it to the hospital with Savannah.    Her ammonia is up and she is kind of dazed, I'm not sure if it is from being in a coma for 40 hours or fromthe ammonia being so high.  Me and Tommy met them at the hospital and stayed for a little while.  It killed me to see her that way.  I have seen her with high ammonia before, I have seen her sick before .  But never like this.  She is having a hard time talking, like she wants to say something, but can't get it out.  Then all of the sudden, she will blurt out a whole sentance.  She is a very sick little girl.    I did see her eyes lite up when I told her how much rain we had and all the mud that was in the yard.  she loves playing in the mud.  Beter than anything on earth, she loves to roll in it, I mean get every inch of her body covered in mud.  "I wuv da mud" she says.  When she gets out of the hospital, I don't care how dry it is, I am making her a mud hole to roll in.
