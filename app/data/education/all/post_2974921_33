this insecurity is getting to me. i can't be so happy when i talk to jammi fearing i'm not good enough to be like his superstar m.u. girl or his ex, mariz or his friends from MC, Assumption and Puveda. it's like my relationship with JP. except this time i'm the poor and idiotic one.  i love jammi but i don't know if he loves me. i do believe him but i'm not sure if he means it....
