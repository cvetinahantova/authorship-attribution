It has become very clear to me over the past several months that Gayle Campbell likes to consolidate her power a little too much. I think that this is one of the main reasons for our problems. Gayle never tells anyone else what the hell is going on. She keeps all the information to herself. A perfect example would be this morning, where there was no meeting. She calls me up last night and tells me that there is no meeting. Doesn't ask me what I think we should do, doesn't ask me if I would like to run the meeting because she is unavailable, but just says that there is no meeting. She didn't even stay on the line all that long. 18 seconds isn't much time to put in your word. I didn't even get to say good-bye. I start on another subject and then I realize there is no body on the other line. If anything is to ever get done she needs to start relaying information to people, and start delegating jobs out, not just keep everything to herself.
