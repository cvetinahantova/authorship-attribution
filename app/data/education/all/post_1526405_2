It surprises me, sometimes, how little I have to say.  I'm always thinking, but not enough seems to make it "out there."  But maybe that's a good thing.  Let's just say, I have an active (and precise!) brain-to-mouth filter.  Campus was strangely crowded this morning.  Sure, it's the start of Summer Session II, but I can't imagine that there is very much variation in enrollment as compared to Summer Session I.  Perhaps more students just opt to attend their classes on the first day?  The activity made me reflect on the approach of Fall.  And I'm not the only one.  Browsing through a silly women's magazine in the supermarket checkout line yesterday, I spotted a reccommendation that we chickas dress in light layers, as they are "perfect for the transition to Fall."  Wow.  But summer's just begun, I know this, and I can't get my hopes up.  Many more humid days lie ahead.  Excitement abounds, though, as we move to our new apartment in a couple of weeks.  It seems almost silly to be SO enthusiastic about it, when compared to life in Boston.  Silver Spring ain't no Beacon Hill.  But to be in the middle of things, activity, energy, public transportation, and coffee shops...well, it occurs to me that I'm very much a city girl.
