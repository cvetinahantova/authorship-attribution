The Bionic Ape   What would you rather have?  A lead-off hitter who goes 5 for 5, or a centerfielder who robs three-run homers with Luigi-esque jumps?  But, you say: Pete, these are both important elements of the game.  How can I choose? Or, you say:  [something I don't understand, some statistical analysis that, based on my half-assed knowledge of statistical analysis, finds a convoluted way to prioritize offense over defense].  Or, you say:  5 for 5 what?  Can we talk about something other than baseball?  I'm bored.  Well, I say:  if you don't mind rooting for a caveman, you can have a guy who is both.   urlLink Johnny Damon kicked some serious Oriole ass last night .  I always knew this guy was more than a sloping brow.
