If not for Kobe Bryant's ability to work miracles, the Lakers would be absolutely screwed in the NBA Finals at this point. Detroit had a 6-point lead with under a minute left of regulation and the Lakers, between Shaq and Kobe, somehow tied the game to send it to overtime.   Fortunately, they manhandled the Pistons in OT, but they could easily be down 2-0. Given tonight's divine intervention, I still have faith in them to win this series, but the Pistons do technically have home-court advantage for the rest of it. It would thoroughly suck if the Eastern Conference won the Finals for the first time since the Chicago Bulls dynasty at the expense of Los Angeles.   As Angelenos, we tolerate our Dodgers' ineptitude, live without an NFL team, and deal with the Clippers being perpetual losers. For the second largest media market in the country, we deserve one perennial champion. May the Lakers continue to serve that purpose.
