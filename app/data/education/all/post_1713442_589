urlLink Funding Rural, Small Schools: Strategies at the Statehouse. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Deborah Verstegen.  From the ERIC Digest:  Early efforts to achieve greater efficiency in schooling focused on educating the largest number of students at the lowest possible cost. Research about schools, following industrial models, stressed the phenomenon of "economies of scale." If industry could boom as a result of such economies, why could not education benefit in similar ways? Subsequently, aggressive state policy initiatives sought to capture similar benefits for education through consolidating schools and districts.   Today, by contrast, more attention is being given to what education dollars produce in terms of morale, student achievement, curriculum, and positive attitudes towards learning. This change in outlook is driven by a growing body of research that focuses on the outcomes that dollars buy (e.g., Fox, 1981; Goodlad, 1984; Hawkins, 1985; Monk, 1990; Plecki, 1991; Turner, Camilli, Kroc, & Hoover, 1986). In particular, recent studies suggest that small schools and districts may be a more efficient investment than large schools, because the learning value per unit of expenditure seems to be higher there (Plecki, 1991; Walberg & Fowler, 1987).   The new findings represent a dilemma for lawmakers, educators, and communities. This issue especially concerns rural areas, since schools and districts there tend to be smaller than their urban or suburban counterparts. This Digest examines state strategies for meeting the unique financing needs of rural, small schools and districts. To what extent do states actually provide additional support for rural and small schools? On what basis is this support distributed?
