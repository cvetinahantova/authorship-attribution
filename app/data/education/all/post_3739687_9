hello all,  well i didn't get to finish the last email because sister erlinda needed to see me.  i'm not quite sure how far i got into my description of the school.  anyway...  one problem i'm having is pronouncing the girls names and telling them apart.  they all wear the same uniforms according to their grade so it makes it even more difficult.  they think i'm funny because i'm so tall compared to them.  one girl even called me big.  it didn't hurt my feelings but i hope those comments are kept to a minimum.  i'm off to cambodia this weekend for a border run.  which means i have to leave the country in order to not pay a penalty for overstaying my tourist visa.  then the school will pay for my work permit next month.  unfortunately i have to pay for the trip to cambodia but from what i've heard this is what every school does.  i guess they want to make sure the teacher is going to stick around before they fork out the cash for a work permit.  anyway.....  not much else to say.  i've got the word on a place to live for extremely cheap very close to where i'm working so hopefully that will work out.  the commute this morning was longer than i'd hoped it would be.  one thing someone asked me is about an example of the improper english used in various t-shirts and what not.  i think my favorite is a bumber sticker that said "do follow me i'm not going"  whatever that means also they commonly confuse wax with vax. i see beauty salons like that everywhere.  the thai people are very nice and friendly which makes things easier.  the only problem i've had so far is shopping.  they are all so small that it is difficult for me to find clothes to wear.  i'm working on the problem.  oh well gotta go.  hope ya'll are having a great summer.  jane
