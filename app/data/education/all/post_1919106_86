Wow   Proving that I'm not beyond surprised yet, my parents dropped the big shocker for the night. I was guessing on it for a while, but tonight they confirmed it - they got me a new car! It's a silver 2001 diesel Jetta, really nice condition. And it drives like a charm! So now I'm working on the name.  arfl  is one choice (it's part of the license plate). Another one would be  Greebo . Or  Gaspode . Or something else. I'll sleep over it.
