Can I ask something?  Why do you have to beg someone to take your money?  We called a lawyer because we are currently looking for someone to help my parents write a will.  The lawyer called back right away, (we were under a false sense of security), and said he was sending us information to fill out.  That was a week ago, what happened?  Now, I'm looking up other lawyers.  I want a big butch to take care of things.  That would be my choice.  Whatever!  I'm going to eat.  This is why I take medication.
