I bought a box of chocolate for her. She really liked them, and we spent the time together. I was always the same; I would take the coconut and sheâ€™d get the almond, I the caramel, and she the cream. I can't remember how it started, but every week we would sit there, eating the little box. It was our time. At first we talked when we ate the box. At that time we would eat each piece at once, not really tasting them or anything. As time when on though, we would talk a little less, and eat the chocolates a little more. It was less about what happened and more about what's happening. It was less about them and more about us. We got to a point where we didn't talk at all. She was there. I was there. I had the box, and we just ate it. We both knew what was going on. We both knew what the other was thinking. We didn't need to say it anymore. We knew. When I look back on it, maybe I should have said it. We knew, but we should have known... I should have known...  Now all I have left is the last unopened box. I still wait everyday for her to return. I still have that box in my locker. I still know. I just wished she did too.
