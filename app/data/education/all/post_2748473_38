I'm listening to a lot of music and going back to some of the roots of music and finding a home in them. My Mikey is leaving soon for South Africa and another of my friends passed away a couple of days ago. I get older, and people are leaving and doing there own thing and people are passing away, and although I do miss them and have good memories from it and loved those times, I am finally getting to a place where I am not afraid of "being alone". I hope that I will fully get out of my hole and stay out of it. I am starting to enjoy my work more and more and more and relearning to ignore stupid stuff that would normally piss me off and try to look past that and do everything in love. I love you all.
