the rain held off -- now, i hope it pours so as to clean all the bird doo off my car from where it was parked last night!  i saw an 11 month old elephant today and it was exceedingly cute =)  so movies last night: shrek 2 (in theater), and cheaper by the dozen (rented)...  the plan tonight?  kristin's church has thursday night services in the summer for people who travel on weekends... she's preaching... we leave in an hour... afterwards, pizza time and watching the movies we rented when we returned last night's choice: "how to deal" and "love actually"... neither of us have seen either of them.  yay for fun downtime.  back to indiana tomorrow.  later dudes! =P
