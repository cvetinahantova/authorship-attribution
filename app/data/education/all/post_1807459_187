Long time no blog.  This won't be too long I think since it's rather expensive by Laos standards to use the Internet.  Anyway I booked a tour at this cafe and we get 15 free minutes so I'll use it wisely, or at least try to.   I have to say I'm enjoying Loas much more than I thought I would.  I thought it would be along the lines of Cambodia and I was totally wrong.  Since my last blog Gyeh-son and I went rafting down a river in Vang Vieng and spelunking (sp?) as well.  This was pretty darn awesome.  The caves we checked out were amazing.  While rafting, really I guess it was kayaking we tipped over 3 times.  I blame it mostly on her.  But no biggie.  She only lost a sandal.  The weather was overcast and had been raining so the river was faster and rougher than normal so we really got our money's worth.  After this little outing I'm convinced Laos is the most beautiful place in the world.   Today was our first full day in Luang Prabang.  This is a nice, cozy little town of much French influence.  We walked around and gave ourselves a tour of the town and temples.  Tomorrow we'll be off to visit some more caves and waterfalls around the area.  Time is flying and I'm running out of it real fast.   I got an e-mail from the guy I work for and I'm going to have to make plans to come back.  If I'm lucky I can probably squeeze 3 more weeks out.
