when I am blessed  with the eyes to see and the ears to hear you I stand upon a mountain and can see forever through your eyes I can feel the layout  of the inner terrain I can love myself by loving you and this grace spills out into the world  when I found my footing atop the mountain I looked around to see the lofty community I tried to speak of joy and was told to be silent I wanted to dance in the thin air and was told to just be It's not that I crave titillation just an enactment of this liberation perhaps in my infancy you could learn from me what it is to be alive and naked in this world without the weight of dusty disciplines  I cannot rest in this place knowing that there are still those striving to reach the summit so although the view is wonderful and the peace is a living thing I begin to climb back down and take one last look around and feel sad for this loneliness in the oneness and half way down the summit I get the view of the community of those neither here nor there  a hand up for you. you can continue to the summit or you can offer your hand too to the ones who are arriving and striving for that mountain view I have been there and have found light there but here is where I belong  on the top of the mountain there is liberation but halfway there is grace and simple love's discovery this is what drives me this is my calling to replace your worn out shoes with new ones and to give you the support to continue your climb to the top of this mountain, and take in the view  perhaps I will falter a bit and find you standing here next to me supporting me to remind me of the view  from where I stand It's a beautiful day when you know what you are and why you are here  I take in the landscape of this middle way and find solace on this day I breath it in deeply and am brought back to this moment by the next seeker  with outstretched hand I am here for you take my hand, and may grace find you in wonder at your journey  Â©2003 DC Vision
