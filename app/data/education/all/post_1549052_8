I know it’s been awhile, but give some time and maybe you’ll understand why.  This blog has a small purpose. It is meant to communicate to you, whoever you may be, what I am thinking, whenever I get around to it.  Of course, I know a lot of you think that isn’t much of a purpose. That’s when you notice this isn’t much of a blog.  I’ve wrestled around with the thought of giving making this blog more than it is. There are times when I sit myself down in front of the computer and actually write out many things that I would like it to be.  Ask me sometime and I’ll show you.  But every time I do that, I know I won’t do it. I won’t put in the time or the effort. I won’t write every week because I have to. I won’t take a bunch of pictures to inflate some server somewhere.  Why?  Because that isn’t this blog’s purpose.  Some blogs exist to report news, others to speculate, still others to do many other things. The list goes on. Some of them are great. Some I read most everyday.  But there are times when I am looking around and I find a blog somewhere and read a few entries. They’re filled with nothings about everything… everything about nothing. These are the blogs that many people write. Hackers. Crackers. Geeks. Nerds.  These are the blogs that have no purpose. No purpose but to exist.  And, though my blog may be small, and infrequently updated, it has something that I would never want to take away. Something that brings you here. Something that makes its existence worthwhile. Something for me to rely on.  Purpose.
