Tired is the word. Went PC to practise my kayaking again. Wasn't a successful practice though cos i can't seem to get it correct. Capsized numerous times. Can get my Stern Rudder and Bow Rudder right..... a complete disaster today. I will get it sooner or later.  Went Raffles City food court for dinner with Addison and Michelle after the practice. Ordered Seafood with Beancurd and eggs on hotplate. It was quite nice actually....and affordable. Quite a good meal. There is still time to spare so we went to check out the Ripcurl Rash (wetshirt). Wanted to get one for kayaking....hmm...it cost 69 bucks...but there wasn't any fantastic designs. Decided that i will check out other areas before buying.   Now i am sitting i front of my comp talking to THE bitch...hahaha......  SIgning off... Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
