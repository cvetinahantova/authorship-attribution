Phase one of packing has begun. I managed to stretch out the task of packing my first suitcase into five hours or so by taking numerous breaks. It seems the only time I enjoy packing is when I'm using it as a procrastination activity to avoid other (more pressing) tasks.  The only three items I'm bringing in excess are anti-perspirant/deodorant (Degree seems to be one of the only big commercial brands that offers the combination of the two), which everyone has told me is a scarce--if non-existant--item in Japan. The next is toothpaste..O.K..so it's not that Japan doesn't have toothpaste with flouride available, but you have to look around more in order to score so I've thrown in four tubes to get me through. The last is tampons, whose scarcity in Asia I have no explanation for. But then come to think of it,  urlLink there's still much confusion about tampons when it comes to North America .        Naively, I choose to believe that if I put anything inside of a ziploc bag any liquid I pack will stay contained there if anything breaks. Call this the suburban housewife's logic but anything inside of a ziploc bag seems like it's providing an impenetrable barrier to me. Hopefully my work clothes won't be soaked in perfume to prove my theory horribly wrong when I open my suitcase on Wednesday.     So I think I followed  urlLink Air Canada 's baggage rules but the task of pushing the luggage onto our uncooperative dodgy family scale wasn't exactly an easy task (it's small and creaky; the suitcase is huge and heavy).  These aren't very interesting, but  urlLink here's the rest .
