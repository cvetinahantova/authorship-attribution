Bought an Orchid on Friday.  Always thought they were particularly interesting/beautiful plants and this one is no exception.  It feels like quite a young proffessional thing to own (even though it was cheap at safeway).  They are such unique plants.  I've heard that they are quite hard to keep alive so I hope we don't kill it.
