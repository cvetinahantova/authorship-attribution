Ugh, it is soo late (for me, anyway...my hellraising days are FAR behind me) but Si is asleep (finally: he stayed up last night playing on his PS2 and I'm surprised he's stayed conscious all day.) Me...well, I just don't have the tenacity any more, I need my sleep and warm milk. But I did want to post, to all who may be reading, that I found out an hour or so ago that I have a job interview!!! and as this blog is supposed to be following my lifestyle change, I thought I'd better mention it. Hopefully I'll remember to elaborate on it further when I wake up.
