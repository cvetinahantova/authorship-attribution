this summer has been a hoppy one for me.  guate, houseboats, and i'm going to head up to seattle sometime soon as well.  good.  i like it hoppy.  last night after heading back to Grace from camp, i stopped by the guys' (dan, billy, keith) place in long beach.  word on the street is that they've booted lance from the casa.  brent was chilling there and they were all playing texas hold em.  i ponied up my 5 bills and joined in.  long story short, i was the last to enter and and first to be cleaned out.  it was a load of fun though.  i dig the game.  i lost many a quetzal down in guatemala playing it.  it'd be great to make it a reoccuring event.  5 bucks?  that's cheaper than a movie and you get to feel like a bigshot for a while too.  i recounted bits and pieces of my guate trip to dan and billy and passed on the trevel bug to them.  they started planning a trip, i suggested cuba and they're on it.  i might have to stop by there myself as well.
