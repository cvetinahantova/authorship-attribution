Greetings from Rome!  We are with Marco, Cinzia, Luca and Debora.  The weather is beautiful, the food is, well - Italian and we are having a blast.  Seems like we're sure having to suffer a lot for this mission trip (not)!  So far we have been meeting with people at the University and in different squares and listening to their stories, sharing ours.  Marco and Luca are planting a church here so we are kinda working towards that.  Sunday night was particularly cool.  We joined them for their church.  Anglo-Italian bilingual worship and then a translated preach and food.  It was very low key and beautiful.    Tomorrow we have a day off so we shall hit Rome's sights.  Our internet was down when we left sheffield but I will post photos as soon as I get back and can sort it.
