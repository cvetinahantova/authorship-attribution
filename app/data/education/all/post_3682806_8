Reality can strike, and when it does it sometimes stings. There are many instances in which life is put into perspective. One is when you feel like everyday is leading towards the uncomfortable closeness of being "elderly". That usually happens when I'm stoned and watching tv or thinking about people who I consider to be old and I think about the fact that they were young once and had the feeling that  youth is eternal and life can be all good-times, then age snuck upon them like a silent assasin and they realize that they had their throats slit before this game even began. Those people woke up one day to find that they don't have such quick reflexes and society doesn't think they're cool anymore, they aren't attractive and are way past their physical prime.     Sometimes though, I feel like life is composed of a trillion or more beautiful moments and it's almost too much to take in. Think about it. A slightly overcast day, sitting with a really good friend, you're both on your fourth beer, and in the middle of a conversation about your plans for a future that leaves you both with this feeling that life is laid out ahead of you. Whenever the sentence crosses your concience, out loud or in your own mind, " It doesn't get much better than this " you have to give thanks to whatever power put you here in this life. Be it fate, God, or some collection of peaganistic fancies. Moments like this make me think that all of life is like this and the only reason it doesn't seem so is because sometimes we forget and refuse to accept it.         Does the "good" in life outweigh the "bad" or the other way around?
