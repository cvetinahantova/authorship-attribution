urlLink Implications of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 for Teacher Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Christopher Trahan. It reviews the different impacts that No Child Left Behind Act has for schools.  From the ERIC Digest:  First enacted in 1965, and last reauthorized in 1994, the most recent reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was signed into law by President George W. Bush on January 8, 2002 (P.L. 107-110). Since its inception, as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society" programs, it has been reauthorized (or amended) approximately every five years. Each of these reauthorizations have given the Administration and Congress the opportunity to add, delete, or modify provisions in the law in response to current demands and expectations.    As the latest incarnation of ESEA, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) amends and changes in many ways programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Although the main component of this bill is Title I, the government's flagship aid program for disadvantaged students, section II of NCLB focuses on teacher education quality.
