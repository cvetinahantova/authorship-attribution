*Geeky laughter & snorting ensues* Alright, I got the presentation for MPLSA done with. Which is good, because it was a 1-hour beast that kept me sleepless all week. Which is bad, because sleep is good. So now I'll be able to get some decent rest for a little while. A few days at least. Ok, would you believe me if I said one day? A night? Would you believe me if I said that I won't hurry to go and do all the stuff that I need to get done? Alright, I admit it, I will end up stressing myself again really soon. Mainly over the Algorithms midterm. And then the stuff for work. Because the folks in the Operating Systems class are turning their assignments in really soon. Which means that I will be doing a lot of work. Someone kill me, please.
