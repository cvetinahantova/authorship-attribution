We are watching 'an extremely goofy movie' for 8th grade science today.  I have 6 periods, so, yeah, I get to see it 6 times.  I'm feeling so goofy right now.  I'm doing medical testing when I get back from guatemala.  I'm getting paid lots of money to have people poke at me and give me drugs.  First up,  a 10 day stay in the hospital and a couple of spinal taps.  word.  I'm going to be a counselor for houseboat camp for Grace middle school group.  Me and another gal on staff will be in charge of a boat with 15 kids.  We'll have 9 boats all together.  130 kids I think.
