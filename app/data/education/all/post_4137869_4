Dear Journal,             Okay, so I’m going to stop saying maybe later today...  That letter will get in here eventually.  So, anyway, Kimberly called me tonight; I was so glad she called.  Her mom got her a cell phone with free weekends, so hopefully we’ll be able to talk again soon.  I gave the brief “lowdown” on stuff.  I told her about Jeremy; she said, “Call him back!”  I told her my letter left today and she should get it by Wednesday.  When I have time to stop during the day, I wonder what I’m going to write to Donnie.  Also, hopefully I’ll remember:  A while back I got Charlotte’s email address and Julie and Valerie’s too.  I need to write to them, see how they’re doing, and ask Julie and Valerie how their dad’s doing.  Remember to put them in my address book (SEND ONLY CLEAN EMAILS), of course I’ll ask them first if they’d mind a few forwards and emails and such.             Donnie’s letter really bugs me; I guess it was sort of heartfelt, but I’ve got no way of knowing what’s up his sleeve.  Is he truly sorry?  And for what exactly?  How he treated me,  dropping off the face of the planet when our son was barely a week old , for not attempting contact until an entire year later!?  That little bitch, he still gets under my skin!  I’m not really tired but my head hurts really badly.  Too much on my mind at once; can’t think straight or see clearly now...
