well hello everyone,  one thing i've noticed about thailand is that everything takes twice as long  as you are told.  so therefore i'm still waiting on my laptop which was  supposed to be in on monday or tuesday.  a little aggrativing but i know i'm  getting a good deal so i guess it is worth waiting for.  anyway... other  than that i've just been invigilating all day.  which is the most mind  numbing thing i've ever done.  i just sat there and watched kids take exams.    ugh!  last night i went out with aurora to a place called the londoner.  it was  great.  also free which made it awesome.  her landlord was there so he  picked up the bill.  between him and niles withers i've eaten two extremely  good meals this past week.  it's so nice to be treated to good food.  anyway... i've gotta run.  nothing else much to say other than erlinda is  back.  she was gone all for the first three days of the week and it was  wonderful.  now she is back raising hell.  i think she thinks that when she  is gone we do nothing.  not true we usually get more done because we don't  have her bugging us about stupid things.  well gotta run.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?
