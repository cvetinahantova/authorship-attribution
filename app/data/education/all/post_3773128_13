Well, I've prepared myself mentally to accept any unexpected stuff during the 5-day BTN Camp which starts this afternoon. Hopefully I'd be able to pull through it and come out in one piece...  Today reminds me of the orientation I had bout 2 months ago. There was also this morning that we were free and I went to a cyber cafe with Rose and another guy, Peter if I remember correctly. I know I'm being sentimental but I just can't help it. 3 months ago I was only prepared to say "goodbye" to all my secondary school's friends. Yet now I had to bid farewell to the friends I met in Kolej Matrikulasi Labuan and soon all the friends I have in INTEC here.  Here's something I came across recently:    F orgive each other   R efresh each other  I nvest in each other  E ncourage each other  N urture each other  D epend on each other  S hare with each other  H elp each other  I nspire each other  P ray for each other
