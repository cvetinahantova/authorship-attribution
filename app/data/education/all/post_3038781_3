How can they say that?   Reading an  urlLink AP story  about the rescue attempts to save a right whale named Kingfisher, it amazed me to read some of the comments made in the article by both the scientists and the author William L Holmes.   For instance:  "We're cautiously  optimistic  about it," said Kent Laborde, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration." ...  While describing Kingfisher's plight [that the approximately "250 feet of half-inch rope wrap[ped around] the animal's body, cutting into its skin and possibly into its bone... hindering its ability to swim lines around... and will continue to tighten as it grows, killing the animal within weeks or months."    I can see the caution... but not the optimism.     Here's another one I thought odd:    "Whales often don't need to be disentangled from debris"   the author writes...    but    "About  60 percent  of right whales become entangled in fishing lines, according to the Center for Coastal Studies, which does applied research and marine mammal rescues. "  I guess  60% of a species  doesn't seem alot when there are only  three hundred  of them left.... How silly of me.
