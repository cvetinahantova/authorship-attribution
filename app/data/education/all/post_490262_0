I had a meeting with my principal in the office this morning.  While I was waiting for him to finish up a few things, I hung out and observed the enormous number of kids who came in tardy.  Each student who is tardy has to come into the office, give an excuse to one of the office ladies and then get a pass written for them.  There were four office ladies busy for at least ten minutes.  What a waste of their time!  What I can't understand is this--school starts at the same time every day.  Students are allowed to come onto campus 20 minutes before school starts.  With that window, you'd think parents could get a handle on arrival time and actually  get their kid to school on time.
