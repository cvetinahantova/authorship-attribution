two stories  Singer Elliott Smith dead at 34 Wednesday, October 22, 2003 Posted: 12:37 PM EDT (1637 GMT) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- By RYAN PEARSON, Associated Press Writer   LOS ANGELES - Elliott Smith, a singer-songwriter whose dark, introspective songs won him critical acclaim and an Academy Award nomination, has apparently committed suicide, his publicist and coroner's officials said Wednesday. He was 34.   Smith's body was found by his live-in girlfriend Tuesday, Los Angeles County Coroner Records Supervisor Marsha Grigsby told AP Radio.   He sustained a single stab wound to the chest that appeared to be self-inflicted, she said.   His New York-based publicist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also confirmed his death.   Smith released five solo albums that received widespread acclaim from rock critics and garnered modest commercial success. "Miss Misery," recorded for Gus Van Sant's "Good Will Hunting," was nominated for an Oscar in 1998.   Smith's songs often were compared with those of Alex Chilton (news), Nick Drake and the Beatles, his favorite band.   Lyrically, they addressed dark subject matter such as drug addiction, troubled relationships and loneliness � though Smith tried to distance himself from the label of confessional songwriter.   "I don't feel like my songs are particularly fragile or revealing," he said in a 1998 interview in the Los Angeles Times. "It's not like a diary, and they're not intended to be any sort of superintimate confessional singer-songwriterish thing."   However, Smith had recently spoken in interviews about his struggles with alcoholism. "When I lived in New York I was really a bad alcoholic for a few years," he told Under the Radar magazine in an interview published in June 2003.   In an effort to quit drinking, Smith said he had undergone treatment which administers an intravenous solution meant to clear the bloodstream of toxins.   Smith was born Steven Paul Smith in Nebraska; his mother was a singer and his father was a psychiatrist. He spent most of his childhood with his mother in the suburbs of Dallas and then moved to Portland, Ore., while in high school to live with his father.   He studied piano and guitar as a youth and began composing songs when he was 13. He began calling himself Elliott in middle school, he later explained to a reporter, because Steve sounded too "jockish."   A graduate of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., he later joined a Portland punk band called Heatmiser. On the side, he recorded several solo albums � "Roman Candle" (1994), "Elliott Smith" (1995) and "Either/Or" (1997), all on independent labels � that won him a devoted underground following.   In 1997, he moved to New York, where Van Sant approached him with an offer to use several of his songs on the soundtrack to "Good Will Hunting." The movie was a hit, bringing Smith's music to a mainstream audience.   Smith subsequently signed with DreamWorks Records and recorded two albums; "XO" (1998) and "Figure 8" (2000) continued his critical winning streak, and took him to the middle reaches of Billboard's Top 200 albums chart.   "I don't really have any goals as a songwriter," he once said, "other than to show what it's like to be a person � just like everybody else who's ever played music does."     Niagara Falls Survivor Blames Depression  Wed Oct 22, 9:03 AM ET    By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer   NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario - A man who went over Niagara Falls head first said Wednesday that he was driven by depression, not a desire to become a daredevil.   Kirk Jones, 40, of Canton, Mich., is charged with illegally performing a stunt. He is the first person known to have plunged over the falls without safety devices and lived.   In a phone interview with ABC News, Jones said he had been depressed, but surviving the plunge made him want to live again.   "I honestly thought that it wasn't worth going on. But I can tell you now after hitting the falls I feel that life is worth living," he said.   Family and friends have said Jones had been considering the stunt for years. One friend said Jones hoped to make a lot of money from the notoriety.   Eric Fronek, 21, also of Canton, told ABC that his friend had discussed going over the falls in the past, but was driven to act by depression.   "I think he just reached the point where whatever happened was the best plan for him ... If he made it, he might benefit with money. If he died, so be it," Fronek said. "That's what depression will do to you."   Jones said he made the jump on impulse, and immediately wished he hadn't.   Going over the falls was like "being in a giant tunnel, going straight down, surrounded by water," Jones told ABC. He said he "hit hard," was turned upside down in the water below, then pushed out far enough by the current to climb onto a rock.   Jones was not seriously injured and remained hospitalized in stable condition. He could be fined $10,000.   Jones' parents told ABC he had been suffering from depression, but his mother said surviving a leap from Niagara Falls had intrigued him for years.   "He said he always thought there was a spot you could jump and survive," Doris Jones, 77, told The Associated Press from her sister's home in Keizer, Ore. "We never agreed to it. We thought it was risky."   Suicides are not uncommon at Niagara Falls, although police are reluctant to give numbers. Since 1901, 15 daredevils have taken the plunge in barrels or other devices, including a kayak and a personal watercraft. Ten survived, said Niagara Falls historian Paul Gromosiak.   Only one other person is known to have survived a plunge over the Canadian Horseshoe Falls without a barrel or other contraption � a 7-year-old boy who was wearing a life preserver when he was thrown into the water in a 1960 boating accident.   No one has ever survived a trip � with or without safety devices � over the narrower and rockier American falls.   Niagara Parks Police Inspector Paul Fortier said police believe they have a videotape of the jump made by someone who accompanied Jones. That person has not been charged. Fortier said Jones was undergoing psychological tests.   Brian Merrett, chairman of the Niagara Parks Commission, called the stunt "stupid."   "Our people went down in the gorge and got him," Merrett said. "That's why we don't condone this. It puts all of our people � the fire department, the paramedics, everyone � at risk to do the rescues."   Water rushes over the falls at a rate of 150,000 gallons a second.   Lynda Satelmajer, of Brampton, Ontario, said she and her family watched the man as he entered the river and then went over the falls.   "He seemed a bit edgy, kind of jumping around," she said. "He walked over to where we were standing and he jumped and slid down on his backside and went over the brink.   "It was really freaky, actually. He was smiling."
