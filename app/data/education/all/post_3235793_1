this is a song, which i wrote yesterday. yepz.. breaking it into its parts, but its supposed to be a long proclaimation..(so read in a breath!!) so 'ere we go!! -----------------------  (Verse) I miss you, I need you, More than my next breath of life.. And I want you, in my arms, So reassure, my restless heart,  (Chorus) That you want me, that you need me, that you miss me, more than i miss you.. That you want to, be in my arms.. For the rest of my, restless days..  (Verse) Cause i believe, You're the one.. Who'll end my lonely nights, (these) Fear-filled days..  So i ask you, To hold up you're hair, And with this, Please be mine..  And i'll cherish you, And i'll promise you, So reassure, My restless heart..  (Chorus) That you want me, that you need me, that you miss me, more than i miss you.. That you want to, be in my arms.. For the rest of my, restless days..  (Outro) Cause i want you, And you're always on my mind.. All day, Whole nights.. I spend sitting here, Thinking of you..  I want you, I need you, I miss you, More than you miss me.. And i want you, In my arms, For the rest of my, Peaceful days.. i want you.. -------------------------  Btw, its entitled: With This, Please Be Mine..
