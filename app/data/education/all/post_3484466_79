I'm starting to get a bit tired... I'll be pissed if I fall asleep now. I have to at least make it past 2... then I'll be making progress. Hopefully I'll be able to make it to nightfall, though.  Anyway, I was playing with this freeware 3d modeller called Blender, and it's a biotch. I think I'll stick to GMax for the time being. If Rhino were free, I would be happy... and Milkshape would be a nice freebie, too. 3ds Max would of course be a lovely freebie, since the retail price still runs at about $3000. Of course, GMax is like the same program as far as the actual interface goes, and that's the one thing I don't like about Blender. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.
