You Don't Miss Your Water (Til' The Well Runs Dry) --by  Craig David ... my favorite song for now...lyrics:   As I sail with you across the finest oceans On our way to find the key to our emotions Together we will move the clouds to brighter days Some people question what I say Try to break up you and me But I know this love between us is growing stronger You can call me whenever from wherever Just remember that I'll be there Through all the stormy weather Us break up never No we'll be together Forever  Chorus: You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry But I believe so strongly in you and I Can't somebody answer me the question why You don't miss your water til the well runs dry  As I close my eyes Sit back while reminiscing Of when we used to fuss and fight but end up kissing There may be sad and pain for time along the way But in my heart you'll always be everything and more to me For I know this love between us is growing stronger You can call me whenever from wherever Just remember that I'll be there Through all the stormy weather Us break up never No we'll be together Forever  Chorus  For you are always on my mind You are always on my mind Girl you know that you You are always  You are always on my mind You are always forever  Chorus  You don't miss your water girl no But I believe so strongly in you and I yeah Can somebody answer me the question why Cause you don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry yeah listen If you ever get the feeling You wanna play around starting cheating, remember You don't miss your water 'til the well runs dry    for those of u who managed to figure out my nickname on msn messenger, then u should be able to get here...and congrats to you guys who have succeeded... everytime i post a message, my first line will be about my favourite song for then... so anyway...a big hi to all my pals in ahs...i heard u miss me lotzz...sori i cant visit u guyz just yet...ive been so busy recently...hope u understand...but now the hols are here so i guess its better now...but any way... email me if there's anything ok? im going to watch disney on ice--beauty and the besat on friday nite...hope it'll be good....anyway...gotta catchup on homework ...c u soon!
