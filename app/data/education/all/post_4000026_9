Well woke up at 7am...erm okay more like 7.30 and had to rush to prepare for tuition first which was at 8, man was I still in the "dead brain" mode.So tuition was cool, managed to get a year paper done for A-maths while my tutor was playing with the pup. Lol.So I hurried to church at around 10 plus plus, and service was kinda odd, it was a mix session with chinese, so it took longer I guess as the pastor had to translate the words into chinese for the chinese chaps.    Okay I was so mad this morning when I took some wrong information for Iris to get the results recorded. Hope she wasn't angry. Yeap... after church I went to Selatar with Jake and his mum(my god mother rather) to have lunch at the counctry club. The houses there were gorgeous! Kinda brought back memories of how Australian houses looked like, though the weather is the only difference. So I headed home with god mum's yummy cheese cake, can't wait to eat'em with my brother Dickson. Lol. Well I'm about to head out to meet me other bro(Alvin) to play pool, study, play with my pup and watch Ju-On 2!!! Freaky!
