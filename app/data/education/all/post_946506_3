She paused, briefly unsure of her decision, but then remembered her earlier bravado and climbed the last few stairs.  Dex remained in his position on the bed, lying on his back, propped up on one elbow, watching her approach.  Although he made no move toward her, Catrina could see that he was as relieved to see her as she was excited to see him.  She tried to read his face, but could not see anything in it beyond his easy smile and ridiculously beautiful brown eyes.  She covered the distance between them slowly, wanting to savour every moment of their encounter.  The bedroom window was open, and the cool night air caressed her body as she walked.  She felt her skin prickle as her nipples tightened into firm rosebuds.  Her entire body quivered with excitement, and she had to make a concerted effort to stop herself from sprinting the last few feet and throwing herself onto the gorgeous man in her bed.
