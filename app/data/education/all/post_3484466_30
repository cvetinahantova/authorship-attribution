Ah, yes. I forgot I had to wait for this download to finish, so I'll just waste some more time.  I finally installed Office XP on this computer, so I don't have to use WordPad anymore... I hate that program. Notepad is awesome, of course, but the lack of text formatting doesn't cut it for school assignments. Word is definitely cooler than WordPad...  Anyway, with it came Outlook, which I haven't used in a long time, but I got it all wired up and suddenly I'm really organized. It's crazy, and I love it. I started remaking my address book, as I've done many a time, and I put tons of stuff in the calendar, like things that are coming up, and birthdays, and anniversaries, and more. I'd forgotten how good it feels to have your time all organized.  Right, well, the download is almost done, so I'm going to check up on a couple LJs and then go to bed.
