Well...The new year has begun, and I feel as though my brain is being pulled in all different directions.  My classroom is still not up to par with my personal standards...Although its the crappiest classroom...The kids are pretty good.  My main thought the first day of school this past Tuesday, "Will I ever get them to be as great as my kids last year?"  Well, one of my answers is no, first they will NEVER compare to my first class.  I told Sean that I think I'll be comparing every class to my first class.  I saw one of my old students Tuesday and I nearly started to cry.  I wasn't nervous at all to start the new year...Maybe in my own mind I thought it was all a dream and that I was able to keep my first class forever.  Oh well...One must grow from what they learned and move on to the next task at hand.    I have a student who I realized with my own eyes and ears is a little thief.  And a liar.  Arghhh...I WILL put a stop to it this year.  I will not have it in my classroom.    So I am about to leave to go to Best Buy....I think I might be getting myself into a bad hobby: scrapbooking.  YIKES!  They have a whole new section where they help you and stuff...We'll see.    Last night Sean said something about how he thinks we are just used to each other.  I was thinking about it and hmmm..Maybe that's true.  Although he has things that can annoy me, those things don't bother me the way they used to. I'm sure I still have my idiosyncrasies that piss the hell outta him but I'm trying.  Anyways...I'm off...
