My life has turned upside down Everything I believed in and everyone I trusted Turns to be something and someone I’ve never dreamed of  Maybe I was wrong I put too much faith on us My hope was too high  Maybe I was driving at the wrong way I chose wrong turn That led me to you  I took my chances, but they were wrong I was wrong about you and me Now I have to live with that  Now I don’t know I really am so scared What my life will be like When you’re gone  Can I survive Will I still be able to look at my reflection And say I will go through this  I am really a scared girl
