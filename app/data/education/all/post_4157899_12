Anaheim, California, 10:39pm. It is currently 70 degrees. My gosh! There is no wind blowing. It is hot! I had to turn the air on! All day I went with the windows open. How is it that it is now hotter then when the sun was shinning?! If I were in Baja right now, it is only 66 degrees. Of course even if it weren't cooler because of the ocean, I would still be in Baja. I could be here hot, or be in Baja hot. Hmmm, you decide which is better!!!
