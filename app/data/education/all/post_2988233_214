Tonight was the night for runaways.    I live at bottom of the hill, to the left on top of the hill, my parents live, go on up over the hill, Renee lives there, and my sis lives in between renee and my parents. We all live on a private dead end road, with only 11 families on it.  Me at the beginning of the road, renee and stan are the next to last house. Confused?????  I was leaving my parents house this evening aroudn dusk, and came by my sis's, around the curve, and there, in the middle of the road stood Savannah.  She was chasing a kitty she said.  halfway to my house.  I picked her up, and called her dad, todl them I woudl bring her home in a few.  Get home, and my oldest tells me that while I was gone, he chased Noah down 3 times, he was going to Renee's.    Somehow, at the same time, our two kids were both heading to each others house, without parental knowledge.  They must have ESP, or soem other type of connection, about 200 more feet and they would have met inthe middle.
