Marija is a girl I met last September when I started the Elementary Education Program. She majored in Biology and she decided to apply to the program when she realized she had the patience to work with people who didn't have a good grasp of English. She's originally from Serbia, and she carries an accent, that gives her international status away. She values a healthy diet, preferring organic foods to chemically treated ones. And for awhile she was a raw foodist and grew her own bean sprouts. Sometimes when she speaks to her boyfriend of 8 years in Serbian, it sounds like she is ordering her around. But that is just what Serbian sound like to me, because I am only well-versed in English and a little bit in Cantonese. When she speaks in English, she doesn't sound as firm, but it's still usually a more serious tone, even when she's joking. I have another friend who speaks in the same way, and it's really hard to tell when she's pulling my leg because her voice would never give her away.   I like hanging around with Marija because she's honest and trustworthy. Right now, I'm waiting for her to pick me up so that we can go bikini shopping. She hasn't found her dream suit yet.
