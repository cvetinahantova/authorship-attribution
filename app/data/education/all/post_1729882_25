#2 son had 11 year old All-Star tryouts today.  He fielded the ball with no problems.  He caught the ball in the outfield with ease.  He even hit the ball better than he has all year.  But, the one thing that he has excelled at the whole year, pitching, he didn't even attempt to do.  When I asked him why not, all he would say is, "I don't want to!"  Needless to say, I was livid.  He has pitched awesome all year.  He is getting the same attitude that his older brother has - If I have to work for it, I don't want it.  I think he is afraid that he will be facing tougher hitters in tournaments and he won't do as well.  His brother isn't even going to try out for the team because he hasn't hit well this year.  I have offered numerous times to take him to the cage to hit, but he never wants to.  He wants to be good without any effort.  Being the baseball nut that I am, this is driving me crazy.  I want to yell and scream, but I don't want to push them into something I want and they don't.  Don't know what to do.
