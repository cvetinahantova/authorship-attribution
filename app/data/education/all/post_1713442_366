urlLink Access & Persistence: Findings from 10 Years of Longitudinal Research on Students. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Susan P. Choy.  It looks at how persistent college students are in finishing college degrees.  From the ERIC Digest:  What do we really know about who's going to college? Who persists on the path toward a college degree or credential? What happens to students after they enroll?    To answer these questions, the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) launched three national longitudinal studies to track students' movements into and through the postsecondary education system. These three surveys, launched more than a decade ago, include the National Education Longitudinal Study, the Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study, and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Study. Detailed descriptions of the surveys can be downloaded from the NCES web site at http://nces.ed.gov. Some of the surveys' key findings about college access, student characteristics, and academic persistence are summarized below.
