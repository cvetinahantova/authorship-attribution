tonight will be unusually short.. i'm not feeling very good tonight..  i cleaned the kitchen today and then sheila came over to check out the animals. after that (around 6) i went to walmart *hey amy...\/\/...* i ran into angel and kevin and hung out with them for awhile. we poured a can of adrenaline in a mickey d's cup and i chugged it as we walked towards the deli where her mom was. and then we went back to the mcdonalds to get a pop and this guy was getting a pop and i'm 90% sure it was the lawn mower kid from the park! but he said he didn't remember me and one of his friends was like "maybe you met him at a titty bar" and angel and i were like dude! that's where it was! that was the night we got wasted.. and kevin got mad cuz "they didn't need to talk to you girls like that". oh well it was all good. then we walked around and they left so i went and found my mommy. we finally left around 9 and came home to pack some more..
