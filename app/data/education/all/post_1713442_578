urlLink Hispanic Students and Community Colleges: A Critical Point for Intervention. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Victor B. Saenz.  From the ERIC Digest:  In recent years issues pertaining to Hispanics* in higher education have garnered heightened attention from researchers and policy makers, and as part of this attention, community colleges have begun to receive increased attention as the decisive link in the greater overall educational attainment of this group. Hispanic college student enrollments have increased steadily during the last two decades, driven by increases at two-year institutions that saw the number of Hispanic students triple (NCES, 2001, Table 207). Despite the surge in enrollment, this group remains notably underrepresented at all levels of higher education, and has one of the lowest overall educational attainment rates of any major ethnic or racial group (U.S. Census Bureau, 1998). Nonetheless, the community college sector has become a critical avenue towards higher degree attainment for Hispanic students as evidenced by the increasing number choosing this path (Wilds & Wilson, 1998; Fry, 2002).   This digest explores the status of Hispanic students at community colleges, including a summary of recent enrollment and transfer trends, a focus on factors that shape Hispanic student enrollment at community colleges, and an overview of an exemplary program that facilitates the successful matriculation of Hispanic college students from two-year institutions to baccalaureate completion.
