First of all, stop calling the USA Men's Basketball team the Dream Team.  They aren't.  There was only one basketball Dream Team, and that was the first one.  Magic, Larry, Michael and the others, that was a Dream.  But you know who the first Dream Team really was?  The 1980 Olympic Hockey Champs.  That was the Real Dream Team.   If you can call any team in this Olympics the "Dream Team,"  it's the US Softball team.  They're 6 and 0.  Four of the games were stopped by the mercy rule.  No one has scored against them.   Let me repeat that.  They haven't given up a run.  I guess for the rest of the teams, it's not a dream.  It's a nightmare.  On another note, today John Kerry once again accused the President of using a front group to attack him and has called on the President to condemn them.  I'm amazed, because Mr. Kerry has never, I repeat, NEVER, condemned George Soros or MoveOn.Org for comparing the President to Adolph Hitler.  They even put it in an ad of their own.  John Kerry didn't condemn it.  In fact, he hired the person behind the MoveOn.org ads to run his internet campain.  Mr. Kerry, what's the real reason you wan the Swift Boat ad taken off the air?
