Attended the  urlLink ISTE/NECC Conference  last week with my wife Lynne who did a presentation on  urlLink Virtual Field Trips .  First time to the French Quarter and  urlLink Bourbon St.   The music and action don't stop (and the beads don't stop falling from the balconies above) except for the early (late?) morning hours.   (But the music seems to only be either Zydeco or bad 80's top 40.)  Never been to such a hot and humid place.  (Though Cleveland has its occasional times.)  No wonder everybody moves so slow and no wonder the smell (presumably of wet garbage, not of the bodies in the above-ground cemetaries) permeates the air there.
