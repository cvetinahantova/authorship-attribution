Well as usual, went to school forgetting to bring the most important file which contains all my homework and ended up re-doing'em in class. Bummer... Anyway I was okay I guess. To think I would pass a test in A-maths based on a topic that I dislike the most, coordinate geometry. Well then there was Parade rehearsal, it was pretty much better this time round, however they still gotta be a little more serious now as ya never know what could happen during the day itself. So yeah I was in school till 6. Well of course I have to thank my friends like Sing Ho, Wee Cheng and Erwin for being with me all the while. They are indeed cool friends to have.    Then we decided...lets go swimming! Lol it was so funny its a Friday but the poolside at DTE was empty! So we had the whole place to ourselves. We started playing and shouting and messing around it was so much fun. I never laughed so much ever in my life...well at least for the pass few weeks. Then we did the lamest of lamest, well there's this mirror thingy wherby the people below can see us swimming. So we started dancing around and my friends were like showing their "erhmm". Lol it was so funny based on the people's faces. So we ended like in a hour and and half time and headed home. Well fun comes...fun goes. Now I'm stuck at home...all alone... Lol hey that rhymes! Peace out ya'll...
