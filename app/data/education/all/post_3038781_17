Any body out there?   If you are and  If you're interested, I'm hoping to launch a website/online community dedicated to working on-life.    in as many forms and forums as possible including coalitions to make the most active and effective use of web-based advocacy tools and sites.      in  forums about setting and reaching our goals whether it's to go to Harvard or get a job by the end of the year or write a country-western screenplay or simply find the right hair color for you.     in any way that we can work on life whether through art, games, chat, humor, music, or advocacy.   Almost any idea is worth discussing and sharing [you know what I mean by almost]. So, if you are interested check back in a few days,  I'll post the address as soon as I have finalized the page construction process.
