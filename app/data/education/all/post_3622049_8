I don't know what I'm doing.  I second guess myself too much.  I over analyze everything I do and everything every one else does.  What's the point of it all? I'm obsessing over lack of contact with a couple of friends.  Is it just that they are very busy, or did I do something wrong?  Why do I obsess like this? What does it matter? I think he's concerned about something that happened nine years ago.  This kind of puts things in perspective.  If he's worried about how I'll react to seeing him again because of something that I was never really upset about nine years ago... How silly is that?  And how silly am I for always worring about how people are reacting to little things?   The thing is there are somethings you can and should keep to yourself.  Are you going to be annoyed about this latter or is it just the moment that it annoys you?  If it's a constant problem get it out in the open, but pick your moment.  One where your all in a good mood and can have a open honest discussion.  Don't let it all fall apart because your not communicating clearly.   That's what happened to my marriage.  I thought everything was fine.  Not perfect, but good.  He was miserable, but wouldn't tell me.  At least not clearly.  Oh, he'd occasionaly have this discussion with me about things, but in the end I didn't realize it was as big a deal.  Really I think he just wanted it to come easy.  Marriage is not like a fairy tale.  It's not easy, but if you really love someone and if your in love then try.   I think that's the problem with today's society.  It's not concedered a big deal to be divorced, so people don't work as hard at their marriages.  The subconsious thread seems to be if it's not easy no big deal we'll just move on to the next one.  I just want to stay single or find someone who feels like I do about not getting divorced.  I can't go through that again.
