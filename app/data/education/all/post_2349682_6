I am totally baked out with week, I made ginger bread cookies yesterday along with the walls and roof of a gingerbread house, all from scratch mind you, woo wee I am dreaming about baking. It's funny though because as soon as I was done with the cookies I went to Brynn's to make her dinner, my place is in the kitchen and I am not even married yet! Putting up the walls in my gingerbread house was a test of my patience let me tell you, I couldn't figure out how to make the walls stick up and not fall down,  I think I screamed a couple of times out of frustration. Anyways, I finally figured out to put cardboard to help the walls stay up, it's worked I'm a genius! Just kidding. So tonight I really didn't have anything planned for dessert so I remembered that we still had cookie dough. It's so funny that even though there weren't very many youth at group tonight they were all very grateful for dessert. Rob even said that whoever I marry is going to be one lucky man because he will get the best dessert and food. Isn't that nice of him to say? Where is that man though is my question? I get told things like this all the time, ok Lord help me be patience, I can wait I really can! Luke totally blessed me tonight because he didn't even make the dessert but he was willing to clean up after us, what a great servant. And two other great servants were Jake R. and Z-Diddy! They helped pass out the dessert and where gracious enough to finish off the dessert that we had left, what neat hearts they have! :)
