Tired and emotional today. The vocab on my internal whiteboard is as follows:  Grumpiness, whining, tetchiness, snappishness, arse.    This afternoon me and Hav ventured out into London Village to buy wedding-related materials, and I turned into a woman.   For absolutely ages I've been bemoaning the female tendency to insert their feet into contraptions which might, in other circumstances, be considered a violation of human rights. I just can't understand quite what the attraction is of a shoe which slowly, over the course of an evening, shreds all the skin from your pinky toe while simultaneously unhooking the achilles tendon from its moorings, leaving you effectively crippled. Why do you do this to yourselves? It's MADNESS.  Except that, this afternoon, I did the exact same thing.   I wore this pair of Converse-style plimsole things that I bought a while ago, and which I really like. But they have super-thin soles, and after two hours traipsing round London's finest confetti outlets, I was losing the will to live. I dunno what it is about pain in your feet, but it's an agony which tears at your very soul until you want to gouge out an eye just to distract yourself from the continuous, throbbing ache. I was not a nice person to know until we'd dragged ourselves home and tea had been administered. So I hold my hands up. Lesson learned. No more will I be snide and unsympathetic to the women in my life when they have tottered around for six hours on three inch heels and can't hack the walk home from Brick Lane. I salute your powers of endurance, and shall phone for a taxi forthwith.   The good news is we bought some lovely favour boxes and confetti.  You lucky, lucky people.
