I was going through my hopeless chest tonight trying to find pictures of my famile for Brynn's mom to see, and I found some of the pictures that Nik and I took together. I really miss her, I know she is going through a tough time right now but I wish that I could be there with her to help her get through everything. I was thinking of writing her a letter and it would go something like this: Nik, Hey there, I am just writing to say hi and that I really miss you. I have been praying for you ever since your mom called me. I wish I could take away what happened but God has a purpose for everything even though we may not understand it. I want to tell you though that I am not going to feel differently about you or condemn you in anyway, I just want to love you but I will give you space so that you can handle this in your own way. I also want to tell you that in order to feel forgiveness you have to forgive yourself, I can't imagine how hard it is to go through something like this but the family has forgiven you, God has forgiven you, it's time for you to forgive you. I know there is no quick solution to make you better so I will continue to pray. I hope though that this isn't the end of our friendship, I hope that you someday will let me back into your life, I hope that if need be I can cry with you, pray with you, or just sit in silence with you. I miss having you as a friend, and it kills me that I can't do more to help you out. I love you so much, I always have and always will. I pray that God will give you the strength to make it through each day. I pray that when you wake up in the morning  you don't dread the day, but will embrace it because there are so many different opportunities to be blessed. I pray that you will always know that God is with you and he loves you. Take care my friend, you are in my prayers. Cela
