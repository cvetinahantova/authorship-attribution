well who's counting anyway?  everybody knows that i have an extraordinary gift for saying the wrong thing at the right time.  I was just talking to Kerrie about how it is to revel in your children's newfound independence the older they get.   one of the latest child-development-stages that our house is at is:   kids can get dressed on their own.   mostly.   Addison runs into more roadblocks then Jaelyn does, though.  And some of them are damnably frustrating...  for him, right now, the worst of these is:   when his underwear waistband gets folded in or back or under.  it doesn't matter which.  Addison is a bit of a purist...can't stand dirty hands, cleans up rooms on his own (sometimes) and corrects me about leaving lights on as I leave a room. So you can imagine how HORRIFYING it is to not get his underwear waistband to sit just right.  He lets out this EXASPERATED scream which you JUST KNOW is about to give way to tears or punches (depending on the tired-ometer).  But (happily) with a simple SNAP of the band....all is righted.    He laughs with an "ow!" when i snap him.  (Just think how he's going to love wedgies...)  Seems like we're all always getting obsessed over our underwear bands though, aren't we?  and then someone comes along and snaps our waistband and we sheepishly laugh "ow!" and realize how we were persevorating...  inappriate disclosure, you ask?  whence the title?  well i feel like i might be committing the ultimate PK sin -- employing my children's foibles to see the world publicly...  so if you would -- nobody mention my indescretion by blogging about his deep personal pain -- as you wish him well on his wedding day...  peace~
