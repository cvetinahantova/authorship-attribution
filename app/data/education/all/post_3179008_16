I was moments from not coming into work today. We had a meeting yesterday where we spoke at great length about staff burn out. I guess I hadn't truely realized how much I was feeling the burn out. I really need to take some time off. The problem is, as I mentioned previously, that I am very loyal, and concerned, about my work mates. We do not have substitutes for when someone is absent. So, I run the risk of loosing my sanity at work, or worse yet, going postal on the students. That is very easy to do in a moment of weakness. I am weak right now. I am frustrated with the class set up we have. I am not happy with the way my work mates in my class are functioning. Perhaps they are burned out too. That is a real possibility.  One thing at a time. moment to moment.  breathe . sigh... find the beauty.  Until tomorrow, if I succeed at keeping myself in check.    Peace, D
