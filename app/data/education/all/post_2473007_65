Down the corridor of time Into the spacious halls of rhyme Where waits the morning's golden glow And sunlight pauses here as though The binding spell, now mystery, Will soon recapture history.   A landscape on the farther wall-- The treasure of this aging hall-- Invites my dreams to visit hence, To leap across the golden fence And run headlong through grassy fields To taste the fruit its orchard yields.   The stifled air within this room Cannot contain the daisy's bloom, Nor can hollow paneled walls Give freedom to the eagle's calls; But I am there and sight is blind As I meander with the mind.
