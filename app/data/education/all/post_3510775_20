Back home, I keep noticing the smallest details: how thin the blades of grass are; how good the house smells with coffee brewing; the way my Dad grills the tri-tip; how my toilet flushes with just one push.  When I went to push down the handle, I think I almost broke it; I'm so used to more resistance!  Even with the cooler weather and the grey days, I miss being home.
