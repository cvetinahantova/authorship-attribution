Ok folks, welcome aboard, enjoy your stay.  A very few guidelines before we get started:   1) Do your best to use proper punctuation, spelling etc.  It's a bit distracting reading erotica if you can't really understand what's going on.   2) Do your best to follow the narrative of the person who posted before you; the idea here is to create a story.  Naturally there can be twists and turns, and new characters, but let's try to give it a kind of flow.   3) Use your imaginations, and have fun! At least for now, I've taken the 'posted by' tag off, so you can all post without fear of anyone finding out how truly dirty you are.  ;)
