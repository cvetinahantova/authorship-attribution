While I am in Toronto, I am hopefully going to see my long-lost-almost-friend, Brad.  He moved away from Halifax shortly after I met him, and we never actually got together for the drink or film we had discussed.  And then we've missed each other the three times that Brad has returned to Hali since moving, for one reason or another. I haven't gotten an email in ages, and I wasn't actually expecting to get a reply, seeing as our friendship never really got off the ground, but I emailed him a heads-up anyway, and then there was his email in my in box.  Lovely.  I love Brad - I wish he was still here so that we could hang out.  And being the wickedly cool, charming, and lovely person that he is, I would also hangout with all of his awesome friends, because guys like Brad only have awesome friends.  *sigh*  Anyway, he invited me to go to an "artsy/queer/indie" place called Vazaleen, which is actually at Lee's Palace.  It's a once-a-month party that's held there.  Even though it's not really my scene, (although I am good at "queer") I though it was really nice that Brad extended the offer.  The world needs more people like Brad.
