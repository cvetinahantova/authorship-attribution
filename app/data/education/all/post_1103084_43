- Writers Bloc -   Hey writers or creative types out there.  I've been wrestling with a creative problem for too long.  I'm going to ask for input here & then let it gestate for a few days -- i'll work on a different project in the meantime.   I'm revising the most recent screenplay _The Legacy of Troy Ludwick_ is our working title....I need a GESTURE or an ACTION that signifies that someone is a nurtuing person.   My character is a man -- about my age.  So the question is -- can you help me?  Do you know a nurturing person?  If you were walking downtown with them (or in any public place) -- what gesture might cue onlookers that they're a nurturer?  Or what action might you infer that someone were a nurturer from?    Stories of nurturers, all.  That's what I'm looking for.    peace~
