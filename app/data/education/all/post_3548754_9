Finally!!! Saturday! But would you believe, we were toxic this morning. So many materials, nameplates, directionals, etc to do in time for Monday.   Called Myk to see if he's awake na for his 12nn meeting. Maid said he's taking a bath (that's good to hear - heheheh).  My officemate's here to pick me up. I have to accompany him to pay something. I hope when we're done, Myk's done with his meeting too.
