For my dearest to be…   It’s ok that you want to go first…   Leaving us behind…   Though I’ve fallen so much in love with you     I won’t mind, we won’t mind   Don’t be afraid that God want to take you away…   HE will return you back to us   When the time is right….     Don’t you worry…   I love you still, we love you still…   My dearest to be…   I’ll be here…we’ll be here…   Waiting for your arrival…
