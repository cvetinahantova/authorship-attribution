I've just read  urlLink The sleek shall inherit the Church  the article that talks about St Toms in the Observer and thought that on the whole it was very balanced, thoughtful and open-minded.  I agreed with many of the comments made about the Evangelical Church and also understand why an observer would be very non-plussed and suspicious of the way St Toms do church- it may seem sleek.  Although as someoe who gets very excited by the idea of "night-club style production" I think they exagerate the differences a little to much.    Also loved the way it celebrated the traditional Church of England and the things it offers.  Although it was trying to pit St Thomas and the traditional church against each other it didn't push the point too far and left room for people to make their own conclusions.  Two quotes sum it up well I think:  "Mostly, though, the evangelicals are merely filling a vacuum; they are reaching out to a post-millennium population that, according to almost every recent survey, feels itself to be spiritually and morally disenfranchised."  Very true, and:  "It's important to remember that evangelicalism might easily shift into another manner of worship over time. It's not necessarily inflexible in itself, and there can be different pockets of churchmanship within it."  This, again, I think is true, and is already happening.  I would say that we are part of shift as is all the other emerging church stuff going on around the world (and a load of other things going on I would have thought).  Hopefully the break that is threatened will not come, I pray that all people involved will be able to embrace the diversity of approaches and interpretations that are within the Anglican Church.  I believe that the breadth of the church right now is a great strength.  After all, I firmly believe that God will be doing more than one thing in his world at any one time,  so shouldn't his church be able to do the same?
