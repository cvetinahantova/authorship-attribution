The consultants are telling me: getting rich is for buying time.  The sooner you get rich, the more you can do with your time, the sooner.  The academics are also telling me that they have found the only career where one can be paid to use one's time to read books.  more questions for the time-machine engineers:  what kind of time are you producing?   who can you access with it?    On a related note, applause for those in Washington who are throwing "salons" in the eighteenth-century style.
