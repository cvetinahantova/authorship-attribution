urlLink   Radio Tidbits   I commute to work about 35 minutes each way.  Most of this commute time is spent listening to the radio (although I do put on CDs now in then out of commercial frustration).  Here are a couple of the things I've heard in the past week:   Out Damn Santa's Little Helper?  Apparently, this guy has a one man show in which he performs Macbeth using the voices of 50 or so of the Simpson's characters (and I didn't even know there  were  50 Simpson's characters...).  He did a little scene for us radio listeners and it was actually kind of funny.     The song in my head...   urlLink The Indigo Girls  are coming out with a new album soon and one of the last songs I heard Friday morning was their newest release, Moment of Forgiveness.  It's been stuck in my head all weekend.  This is only a bad thing because I know none of the words to the song except the chorus so the chorus keeps looping over and over through my head (with a little humming thrown in here and there just to drive everyone crazy!)   One of my favorite things--Overalls!  This morning, as I was getting ready for work, I boldly made the choice to wear my overalls (it was cold outside and I wanted to be comfortable!).  I usually only wear denim on Friday, but since Friday was a workshop day I figured I was due.  Ironically enough, on  urlLink NPR  this morning they were doing a story about  urlLink overalls .  Coincidence?  I think not.  Fate is more like it.
