Eh...   It's Monday again, and it sucks just like every single other fricken' Monday so far. My schedule is not the best either... for the past two weeks I've been getting up 3-4 hours earlier than I normally would, and been getting to bed much later. Probably the only thing that keeps me sane so far is that I take regular naps, but I need a good sleep schedule or I'll burn out.    School and friends   I finally got the official admission from  urlLink Waterloo , which means that I can now go ahead and apply for the visa. On one hand I'm very happy, because I'll be going to a really neat school, probably the best in Canada on the field. But every single day that passes I realize that this also means that I'll have to leave all my friends behind. I did that once, when I came to the States, and it sucks... I'm not the kind of person that makes friends very fast, and it pains me to leave these people... I owe some of them a great deal, and to me they've become quite a family to me. The worst thing is that there is nothing I can do that would allow me to stay, apart from marrying someone.
