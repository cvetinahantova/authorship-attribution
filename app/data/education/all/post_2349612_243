just finally finished with  the house on the strand  -- i actually started reading it in new hampshire over spring break when i was visiting marianne... that it takes me 2 months to finish a quality 300-page book says a lot for how hectic my life is, eh?  i've had nightmares the last two nights on account of people dying in the book and pictures still in my head when i try to go to sleep... figured if i finished off the last 5 chapters tonight, i wouldn't have to worry about it... the plot's done, but it left me with more questions than the average story... i suppose that's a sign of a good and intriguing plot.  at any rate, it's obscure, but i'd highly recommend it... all about being caught between two worlds and determining what's real,... once i got going, i was hooked.  for now, though, i gotta be up in like 6.5 or 7 hours... gotta separate the reality of wanting to think more about the book from the necessity of sleep and go with the latter... joy.  night y'all... for real this time =P
