"Information is chaos." That's a law of communication we learned in Information Science school.  If it held during my first two years as an aspiring woodworker, then my life was bedlam indeed. I memorized hardware catalogs and spent more on woodworking books and magazines than I did on tools.  I learned how to do things that I still have no idea how to actually  do.   The time came when I had read enough. It was time to build something.  I got my cheap Skilsaw, a doweling jig, some red oak boards, four stair balusters, and a slab of edge-glued Aspen, and I made a little hall table. It was alright, and I learned the limitations of the cheap circular saw.  Your typical circular saw for under $100 usually has a stamped steel footplate with curled edges.  Because it is riveted to the saw body, you can never adjust the blade perfectly parallel or perpendicular to the footplate.  It's a lot of fuss to set up a straightedge for a cut, or to start the cut in just the right place, or to complete a cut without the cheesy footplate riding up on the straightedge. And unless you support the board in four places, your cutoff falls to the ground at the end of the cut.  So it's hard to cut straight and smoothly and accurately with a Skilsaw, and repeatability is virtually impossible.        My $60 circular saw, with cheesy footplate    Now imagine making accurate angle cuts with this little beast.  I managed to make an angled box with it, but it's not what I'd call a showpiece.  It was supposed to be a planter.  Instead, I'm using it to hold scrap wood.  I knew I needed a better saw, and at this point, I had two choices: Get a more expensive circular saw, or take the plunge into the world of stationary tools and spring for a table saw.  A decent circular saw with a beefy, square, fully adjustable footplate costs upward of $120.     A much better circular saw, at twice the price        Problem is, the improved footplate only solves a few of the circular saw's inherent problems.  Sure, you can tune it straight and true, and it won't ride up on the straightedge, but setting up cuts is still a bother, and the cutoff still clatters to the ground, throwing the cut out of line.  Still, $120 is a lot cheaper than a table saw. Desperately clinging to my money, I searched for ways to make do with the handheld saw.  I was soon sucked into a world of nifty clamps and high-tech straightedges and even complicated tables that turn a Skilsaw into a makeshift table saw, or overhead armatures that turn a Skilsaw into a makeshift radial arm saw.  Once you add up the cost of these items, however, you might as well have bought the table saw.        Festool's incomparable circular saw and guide system costs as much as 3 DeWalts, but it's still a circular saw     After I built my little table and spent some time hoping no one would look at it too closely, I built a serious oak hall table with my father.  In the meantime, I found that virtually no books, articles, or websites were devoted to building furniture with a Skilsaw. This finally convinced me that I needed a table saw.  I think these circular-saw-and-guide systems are a godsend for contractors who spend their days ripping large panels on construction sites, but there's a lot they don't seem suited for.  Cutting dados, laps, and other tight-fitting joints, for example.  Sure, I have books that tell you how to cut them with a circular saw, and I'm sure I'll use those techniques if I'm ever desperate enough. I imagine myself on a desert island, with only the tools I carried onto my now-stranded boat.  So it was time to buy a table saw. Having memorized several dozen catalogs, I was aware of the price range I was dealing with.  At the bottom end were benchtop saws with tiny, webbed aluminum tables and noisy universal motors, and they went for around $100.  At the top end-- my top end, anyway, which excluded the lavish cabinet saws going for $1200 and up-- were contractor saws by Delta, Jet, and Ridgid.  They feature big, solid, cast-iron tables and smooth-running induction motors. To get into one of these, you figure on spending around $600.    Bottom of the barrel  Middle of the barrel               Delta TS200    Delta 36-650    In between lie many portable and semi-contractor's saws for around $300.  Ryobi and Delta make good examples of these.  You're still getting a nonstandard table, motor, fence, and other parts. It's about half a table saw for half the price.    The top of the bottom          Ryobi BT-3100         Delta TS300     This didn't seem like too good a deal to me. I didn't mind half a table saw, but I thought a fairer price would be more on the order of one-third. That's when I happened on the Delta TS220LS.        Look on my saw, ye mighty, and shrug: The Delta Shopmaster TS220LS     This saw, along with the two other Delta "TS" models on this page, is part of the Shopmaster line, which is Delta's way of saying that it's an el cheapo tool, not to be confused with real Delta saws like the 36-650.  The TS220LS went for $179 at Lowe's and is much like the even cheaper TS200, except this saw has:    a 15-amp motor, as opposed to 13 amps  a bigger table of smooth, solid aluminum  a stamped steel extension wing  built-in outfeed support  beefier fence and miter gage  legs   I figured these features made it about half a table saw at less than a third of the price, and so my mind was made up. All that was left to do was to read online reviews and agonize and flip-flop for about 6 months.  It seems that there were two kinds of reviews: "This saw is perfectly respectable"; and "this saw is useless junk."  I noticed the "respectable" posts talked a lot about careful setup and tuning, while the "useless junk" camp seemed to expect great results from a $180 table saw right out of the box.  Eventually, I broke down and bought the damned thing.  I had many reservations about not going for a real saw, which I justified as follows:     This saw...  which is OK because...    has a nonstandard miter gage, so you can't buy standard jigs and fixtures  I'm too cheap to buy jigs, and you should make your own anyway     has a smallish table  there are many ways to rip big panels, which I don't do very often anyway    has a very short miter gage with too much slop at the beginning  no miter gage is very good, and a shop-built crosscut sled will take care of that    can take only a 1/2" dado set  you can cut full 3/4" dados in two passes    has a noisy universal motor  I own earplugs    requires much fiddling to make accurate cuts  so does any saw    is made of plastic and aluminum, and weighs less than any stationary tool should  I can heave it around my little shop, or up the stairs, or into my station wagon    features very iffy angle markings on miter gage and blade-tilt mechanisms  that's why God made squares and angle-finders    might be too inaccurate for making furniture  I'll still have a portable saw for cutting studs, pressure-treated lumber, and such    is not a real table saw  it's a vast improvement on the Skilsaw, and it's cheaper than dirt    I think the final consideration was the deciding one.
