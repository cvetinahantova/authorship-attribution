Continuing what I set out to do,  I must say that I respect you for the person you are.   I wouldn't be your friend if I didn't like the things you do.  I think that makes sense.    I think I'll start from the top and work my way down.  I like the way God plays a part in your life.  But that's nothing to be prideful about because many people have God in their life.  More so, I admire the way you are loyal to Him and make an effort to live for Him each day.  Some day I would like to have the strength to do that.  I like your family.  Your parents are great.  They keep you in touch with them and at the same time, they allow you to grow and have fun in life and with friends.  Your mind is great.  But that doesn't mean become egotistical it just means that I admire how you are able to achieve your goals.  (I am using like and admire as if they are the same. )  I also think people feel you bring structure to their life.   And without you,  they'd be lost.
