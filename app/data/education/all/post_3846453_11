Well, tomorrow I'm off to Sidmouth in Devon where it will rain and be cloudy unlike last year when it was lovely and hot and we all sat on the beach and swam in our jeans and t-shirts.   I'm sorry to say Sim, but I'm leaving you for about 2 weeks, but in that time, I WILL ring you at some point..... no promises.   Sidmouth has this little (well, actually it's quite big) Folk Music Festival every year and this year it's it's 50th anniversary. My family take me EVERY year, and it's alright seeing as I see my mates there and we have a laugh and make fires up on top of hills. And when random policemen come, we talk about the second Wizard of Oz.   Oh yes, it's great.
