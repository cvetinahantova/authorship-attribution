Isn't it funny how your mood in general is sooooo related to those around you?  I am in a better mood, better outlook on life today.  Why, Dad took me to Sam's, Tommy is in a better mood, I kept Savannah today, the boys are in pretty good moods, you name it, it just seems better today.   Savannah decide she was a puppy today and ate a couple of pieces of dog food.  Anybody have any idea how much protein is in dog food?   I know initially, it sounds funny, but with Savannah's condition,  it isn't funny.  Tommy suggested that Renee call the manufacturor and get the break down.  She has played puppy all her life, she loves to play puppy, but this is the first time she has ate dog food.    We are having Taco Salad tonight for supper.  I can't wait.  We had hamburgers last night.  Don't I sound pathetic.  I have been praying for my friend MJ, they are pretty much in the same boat as us right now.  God used her to help us when we were really down, and I hope he can used me to help her.  She is such a good friend.  We have never met in person, but some friends, you don't have to.  The freindship is there without a face to face meeting.
