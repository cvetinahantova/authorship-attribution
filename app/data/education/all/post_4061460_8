Yesterday was the last day of my summer vacation. I took the kids out to McDonald's, we made yet another attempt at securing some novels for my Freshman class from the distributor, and then went to see "The Village." The movie was interesting and enjoyable, but seemed to stall towards the end. Of course it had the traditional Shyamalan moment where at one point you are given all of the clues to the suprise ending that he has been hinting towards throughout the entire film, which is still rewarding, but starting to grow a little thin.  Today all of the teachers returned to school. I was happy to see evryone and was somewhat surprised that everyone semed happy to see me. I still see myself as a bit of an outsider there, but I guess nobody else thinks of me that way. I finally got to work on my syllabi, and I did some editting to my web page. It never occured to me that I developed my wen page while looking at a 17" monitor and most of the school's monitors are 15". Of course this ends up making the page look goofy on the smaller monitor, so I need to fix that.  We have two new members to our department, Ms. Tanner and Ms. Robinson. They both seem to have a lot of experience at other high schools. We also have a new administrator, Ms. Jennings, and she seems very sharp. I am looking forward to working with her. She has the kind of demeanor where she is very sweet, but you get the impression that if she had to discipline you for some reason, she could really lay the lumber.
