I love the ballet.  I love everything about the ballet.  As a former dancer (of the ballet...not exotic), I always find that I cannot get enough of seeing other people doing something I would have liked to do.  I had my opportunity once.  I was supposed to attend an audition at a prestigious  urlLink arts school , but unfortunately, the day of my audition my dad was sick and couldn't take me.  I really wonder what would have happened to me, and where I would be, if I could have gone.  I also wonder sometimes if my dad was really sick.  Either way, now, since I no longer dance, I like to attend the ballet.  I intend to take Shorty when he gets older.  I don't expect him to like it, but I want him to at least have an appreciation for it.  That way, in thirty years, he can take his wife without argument.  Such a great mother-in-law I will be some day FAR FAR FAR into the future.
