So i had an exciting monday! i woke up this morning around 4am to Brandon sounding like something was wrong but he wouldn't tell me what and said to call him later.. anyway around noon i decided to stop procrastinating and get my phone fixed.. so i'm sitting at a stop light and last time i checked you stop at them when they are that reddish color.. well the lady behind me deicded ahh what the hell stopping is so boring these days.. so yeah i got rear ended. kinda annoyed me mostly because the Pepsi truck driver next to me was cute and i was thirsty.. not too bad tho, it just crunched my bumper a little.. we hope. mom said it could have messed up my rear axil and all that..
