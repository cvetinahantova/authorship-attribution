Today I did not wage war upon a colony of dustbunnies who refuse to pay my tyrannical tariffs because it would require me to actually get off my lazy rear and do work.  Today Martha has not climbed on top of her roof where she was not abducted by aliens while eating fried worms.  Today, like yesterday and tomorrow, Abner Doubleday did not invent baseball.
