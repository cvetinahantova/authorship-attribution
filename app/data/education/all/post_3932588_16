What's up:  Five  urlLink SI Fit 2 heart rate monitors   have been donated to our fundraising effort.  If folks are interested, let's charge ourselves the market price for them with proceeds going toward our $6K goal.  Back story:   After doing a fair bit of research online, I bought a heart rate monitor today. I settled on the above SI model because it has the mixture of features I want at a good price and because user  urlLink reviews  RAVE about how SI makes a better product than its big name competitors like Polar.  Though I've yet to receive and test mine out, I expect it to be reliable, accurate, well designed, and backed by steller customer support from the manufacturer.   I saw a comment about sponsorship on their  urlLink website  after my purchase, and just for the heck of it shot an email to their default "info please" address. Two hours later, I got the following reply:   Karen:  how could any company turn down such a convincing agreement for sponsorship...   Here is a thought.  What if I make available 5 Fit 2 heart rate monitors for your team mates.. they can pay a fair price for them and the money goes toward the sponsorship of getting your training partner a new guide dog.   We may even figure out a way to logo the team to additionally help the cause.   Either way I love your ambition and thoughtfulness for a friend.   Warm Regards   jimmy Olmes President Wild Ideas Inc Distributors of Sports Instruments Products jbolmes@wildideasgroup.com    It sounds like this might be an opportunity for a broader sponsorship situation, but we should decide as a team whether that's something we want to pursue. No matter what,though, I'll post an update when I learn how and when we'll receive the monitors.  See you sunday,  Karen S
