it's raining so hard today. it's cold and gloomy... kinda matches my feelings.  *** yesterday, i had fun online even when jammi wasn't there. i hung out at thebeginners chatroom in mIRC and met this romanian guy who taught me so many stuff about mIRC. he wasn't the only person who had been helpful to me, but no one was as helpful as he was. he even taught me a couple of romanian phrases. his name's alexandru. it sounded really romantic.  i guess even in simple means, the world is united. i mean, people from different countries get along in chatrooms, they even help each other out. maybe it's just the political shit that's making it hard for the countries to get along. and what is with the racial discrimination? like it helps people live better lives. it only makes the world a more chaotic place to live in.
