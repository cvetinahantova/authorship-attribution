In Clark (2002), she conducted an online survey with 10 seniors, then followed up with chat room interviews about their experiences completing an online survey and the interview.  Interestingly, one of her themes matches ours, "Computer Life:  A Sense of Accomplishment and Confidence."  However, an important theme she identified didn't come up in our interviews much:  Living Alone:  Loneliness, Memories and Coping.  Perhaps her seniors were more housebound than ours?  All of our informants seemed very involved and not the least lonely, although I can't recall asking them about this.  Perhaps we should follow up via email with some informants and ask about the role the computer plays in combating loneliness?
