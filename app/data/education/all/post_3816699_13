Spark a match andyou will never be   cold again. This is really only all we have.     I have a large collection of thunder that I stole from your windowsill.     You had the best damn Sunday dress at the end of the world. The wall of flames that consumed you and everything that was good, "not with a band but a whimper." What would you do? arms spread welcoming the impending nothing.          Fuck it, no one cared anyway...
