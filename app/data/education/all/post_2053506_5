I need to journal what I've done else I forget  I made a scarf from my knitting book.  Book I:  The Knit Stitch.  It's the horizontal scarf.  I used homespun yarn from Walmart.  Like three different types.  It was a good first project - the yarn is WAY forgiving.  I followed the directions exactly.  Project 2 - I used the Reader's Digest beginning purse sample.  I used the left over black homespun stuff from the scarf.  I used the required needles.  I didn't follow the pattern exactly.  The yarn is forgiving and the stitches don't show up so well.  I ended up not doing the seed stitches on the sides of the back.  The cable was good, but it can't be seen. I sucked at the handles and the lining.  I kind of made my own handles - they're uneven though.  The lining was a disaster.  I used my own stuff and it's all crooked.  Oh well.  It's cute  Project 3 - my own kitting bag,  I used size 6 needles because because I wanted a tight weave.  I used all left over yarn. In fact, the navy yarn is a totally different weight so I didn't use it very much because it was totally different when I used it.
