Can you believe it?  I can't, Dale Jr won Atlanta today.  I am shocked.  I totally didn't expect him to win.  Way to go joonya!  His dad has the record for the most wins there, so I should have know he would be good there one day.  4 races into the season, and he has two wins, kenseth has the other two.  Do i smell a busch series rematch coming?     Duke got the 1 seed , but the nutty committee put Carolina in the same bracket as them.  Not a good thing.  I really don't want to see Duke and Carolina going at it before the final four.    Still in a good mood.  I am on a streak.  aaahhhhhh relief.
