Couldn't wait to get started. Showed up 30 min. early.  Wheeled the bodies out. Pushing the gerny is like trying to control a shopping cart with a broken wheel. Thank god they are dead because I bashed their heads into the corner of the lab table as i wheeled them out. OUCH!   Finished working on the legs then soaked the muscles down with water packed them with dripping wet handy wipes and then tied the skin flaps closed.  then four of us pushed Zeus yes we named him Zeus, to the right side of the tableand flipped his stiff ridged body over onto his back.  One of the guys in my group was having a very hard time dealing with now that the body was face up. He said this was beacuse it was now more real that we were skinning a person becasue he now had a face.   I took care of that. I though a rag over Zeus's face. Now lets get to it.  I started to make a superfiscal vertical cut from his chin straight down his chest then abdomen around his navel. By the way he is an inny. All the way down to his pubic bone.  Then made a horizontal cut across his neck just above the clavicle, and another horizontal just below his ribs and the last horizontal cut across the pubic bone.  Again, I took the forsips and pull back teh skin exposing the fatty tissue. Cleaned off the fat exposing the muscles.  Pectoral major, Pectoral minor, and then to the Abs - Internal and external obliques, rectus abdominis (6 pack).   I finsihed up working on the front of the legs and the front of the arms.  Damn the more I do this work the hungerier I get.
