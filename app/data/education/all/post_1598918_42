From  urlLink Online Learning Update    urlLink  One Course, One Web Site - of Course? Maybe Not! - Ellen R. Cohn, Educause Quarterly     "Colleges and universities increasingly employ commercial Web-based course management systems (such as Blackboard and WebCT). How is it, then, that these institutions unquestioningly allocate a unique Web site to each class? Why establish one Web site for one course when other options provide so many benefits? Why isn't there a clamor for information systems that can accommodate multiple purposes and audiences and provide life-long continuity throughout the many phases of our educational, professional, and personal pursuits?
