Most of you know how fanatical I am about styles and appearances, and I'm working right now on an improved, multi-media version of the site.  As we all work on Macs by day, I thought I should post this--it's an image of a second-level page in MSIE6/Win.  Check out the extra spaces in the navbar...     Here's another problem, it's with MISE5.5/Win.  Not that my prototype is any better...
