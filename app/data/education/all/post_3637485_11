Ok I am so going to piss someone off with this, but since no one reads my page I feel safe enough to write it.  If you have read any of my past entries you know I believe in legalizing gay marriage. Do I think this is going to strengthen the institution of marriage? Hell No.  I believe in equal rights and not granting those rights is treating homosexuals as second class citizens. Straight people have destroyed marriage. The divorce rate in this country is at an all time high.  Oh but my parents aren't divorced you say, well good for you. I bet you do not have to think real hard to come up with 5 of your friends whose parents are divorced.  The state of marriage is in complete shambles. Today television is filled with short lived Hollywood marriages, reality marriage shows and Divorce Court. What the gay population wants is to show that they live normal lives and that they love just like everyone else. This very true, they also fall out of love just as fast as everyone else.  There is no way that gay marriage will strengthen the institution just like there is no way gay marriage will weaken it. Some will make it and to them I say alright, but many will fall short.  I myself make no plans for marriage, my parents showed my how much fun all that crap is and I will pass on it thank you.  So I am all for gay marriage. The gay community pays taxes just like everyone else and should be allowed to make the same mistakes as everyone else. End of discussion.
