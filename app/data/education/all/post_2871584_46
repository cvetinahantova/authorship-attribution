Nicole got here this afternoon, and we've had a fun evening.  We hit Cavallo's for dinner--you've got to love $1.50 spaghetti night.  Then we came back and watched a couple of movies.  One of those was "Pirates of the Caribbean" which I have to admit was not the greatest movie I have ever seen.  When it first came out, I saw the commercials, and didn't think it looked that great.  Then, everyone started raving about how good it was, and I figured that maybe it just had some bad commercials.  Stranger things have happened.  However, I just never got around to watching it.  So tonight, we decided to check it out and... I hadn't been missing much.  I mean, it was a cute movie, don't' get me wrong, but I just didn't feel like it was worthy of all the hype that people have been giving it.  So... since the movie wasn't as captivating as expected, we pulled out some board games while we were watching it.  We played Monopoly and Yatzee and a few different card games, while we caught up on some good stories.  Tomorrow begins the real fun of road trips to go check out various colleges.  There's nothing like a good road trip to create some funny stories.  :-P
