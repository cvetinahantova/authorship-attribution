urlLink What Federal Statistics Reveal about Migrant Farmworkers: A Summary for Education. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Gary Huang.  It examines federal statistics pertaining to migrant farm laborers.  From the ERIC Digest:  To help educators quickly grasp demographic information and social and economic issues facing migrant farmworkers, this Digest summarizes several recent federal reports. Some reports cover the overall agricultural labor force, using terms such as "hired" or "paid farmworkers," "agricultural workers," "crop workers," or "migrant farmworkers." These terms overlap to a large extent and generally refer to a socially and economically disadvantaged group of Latino migratory farmworkers. We shift terms in this Digest to accommodate definitions used in the following sources:    * "National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS)," a national survey conducted by the Department of Labor that collects data about paid farmworkers (Samardick, Gabbard, & Lewis, 2000)    * "Current Population Survey (CPS)," conducted by the Census Bureau, which includes up-to-date demographic data about farmworkers    * "Farm Labor Survey (FLS)," conducted four times a year by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which gathers information on agricultural occupations, including migrant farmworkers
