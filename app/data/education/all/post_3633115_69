That is a hypothetical question.  After reading a post by  urlLink Joelle  entitled "20 Questions to a Better Personality" I decided to take the  urlLink quiz .  Here is the result:   20 Questions to a Better Personality  Wackiness: 52/100 Rationality: 50/100 Constructiveness: 52/100 Leadership: 28/100    You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.       Now I read the "nice" spin they put on the title of SEDF - but really it just sounds like I am a pathetic boring person who tends to be a follower and is emotionally destructive.  Although I do agree with the last sentence.  Do not mess with me, I  will  explode.
