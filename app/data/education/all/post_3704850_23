I just created a blank template.  If you want  to include an external link on the sidebar, to, for instance, the MCS department homepage, simply use the blank template and the following PHP script:    <?  header( "Location: http://cronus.mcs.alma.edu/" );  ?>    Using this template, you can do any PHP processing necessary without leaving the CMS. If you want to have a page in the system without appearing on the sidebar, simply set the parent_id field to NULL in the webpage table in the almacms database.
