You will not believe this.  I have this one student named Brian.  He is "medically fragile" meaning half his face is deformed so it is more than obvious something is wrong with him.  Today the govenor came and gave a speech to donate money to the school.  Last night Brian made a card with a picture of the govenor saying GOOD JOB!  WOW!  Oh, Brian also wears a suit and tie everyday, so when we were in the assembly and both Brian and the govenor are wearing the same things.   So, the govenor walks in and Brian jumps up as he is walking in and gives the govenor the paper. I am shocked the secret service didnt do anything!!    The govenor starts his speech by thanking Brian.  Brian runs up on stage and shakes his hand.  Then, he throws his camera at the headmaster, Dr. Corson to take a picture of the both of them.  THEN, he gives the headmaster attitude about not knowing how to use the camera!!!  Everybody was roaring laughing!!  The govenor invited Brian to sit on stage during his speech.   As the govenor was leaving, he made his rounds to shake everybodys hand...dont worry, right behind him is Brian,...everybody there needs to shake the hand of the govenor, and Brian!   Thats my Quad 1 student!  I can't wait to see the news tonight!!!
