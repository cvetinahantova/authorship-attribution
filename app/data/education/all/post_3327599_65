Horoscopes are funny don't you think? They never seem to say the same thing and they always seem to know exactly what's going on in your life.. maybe everyone who is an Aries has my same issue today.. i highly doubt that but you never know. so today it tells me "one word, one glance or the right gesture and you'll be back in love again". and then it continues to tell me to wait at least 2 weeks before going to vegas. (is J.Lo an aries?) to me that doesn't help because i extremly like (not love..) ppl really quickly. i'm awesome like that. and then my flirt part of it goes on to say i need to explore new territory... Pittsburg here i come..
