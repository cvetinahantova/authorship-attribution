I went to play at the monthly  urlLink Bunco  game tonight and I won $10! I know that seems trival but I  NEVER  win anything at Bunco.   Otherwise today was kinda of a blah day. I did paperwork, set up my first physical therapy appointment, read, went to the gym, and worked on some grad school stuff. I wish I had something more exciting to report...like an engagement ring. Now that would be exciting!
