was late to my only class today because of traffic... took me 20 minutes to get to campus instead of the usual 10... turned out i was only the second one there and class started 15 minutes late anyhow... oh well.  worked on algebra homework all day.  this week's homework is extremely frustrating because it covers a whole chapter in the book which he covered in about one lecture.  no one knows what's going on... at least when i left campus just now, i have an idea of something coherent to write for each problem and that's good.  it's yucky rainy today... go figure.  and this is from someone who loooves rain.  got 2 hours to eat, patch clothes, write up algebra, and get ready for church.  it'll be interesting... my church is holding a seder in half an hour (5:30ish) that you had to make advanced reservations for... going through the whole traditional seder stuff, but making the stuff around the 3rd cup of wine (the cup of redemption) into Christian parallels... i didn't have time or $$, so i didn't sign up.  i'm not sure if the "7:30 holy communion" on the church schedule is part of that and paul and me will be joining a bunch of people who have been around all evening, or if it's after... we'll find out i guess.  amanda just got home as i was unlocking the door... she seemed disappointed i was just getting home instead of just leaving... oh well.
