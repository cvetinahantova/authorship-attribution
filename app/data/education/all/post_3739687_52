hello everyone,  well tgif!  i went out with some folks from the school last night.  we  started at the irish exchange and then moved on to a place called noreiga's.    it was lots of fun.  they were having an 80s night which isn't my favorite  music, but it is tons of fun to dance to.  anyway... i was supposed to met  up with aurora only but tons of people i knew just happened to be there.   some friends i met through molly and others from the school.  it was weird  eveytime i looked up i would see someone i knew.  it reminded me of how in  oxford, ms that would always happen.  other than that i don't have much to tell.  it's been raining more lately.   i think i'm understanding the meaning of monsoon season now.  actually it  think it is starting to rain right now.  i usually just stay in my room  until it stops, but i always end up being caught out without my umbrella.  oh also, i finally got the internet connection in my room working.  yeah me.    i guess i'm not quite as computer illiterate as i thought i was.  o.k. maybe i have more to say than i thought.  sister erlinda called an woke  me up this morning. crazy nun with a bad habit. i programmed in that number  as well, but the sneaky lady most know this and use a different phone  everytime.  she might be nuts but she is no idiot.  well gotta run.  love  ya.  jane  ps i have a little room on my email list now so if you know of anyone who  wants on it let me know.  also you could give them the address for the blog.  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
