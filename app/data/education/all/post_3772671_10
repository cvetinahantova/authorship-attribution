This  urlLink New York Times  article gives a surprisingly sympathetic account of the difficulties facing gay Republicans. Some people are even threatening to *out* them!  The best reasoning on outing is still in Richard D. Mohr's  Gay Ideas: Outing and Other Controversies . His main argument is that one has to out if one wants to remain an honest person. You may want me to keep a secret, but you don't have the right to make me lie, just to protect your secret.  He also makes a useful distinction between privacy and secrecy. Even though John Kerry, John Edwards, George W. Bush, and Dick Cheney all frequently allude to their marital status, no one believes that the public has a reasonable right to know what these married couples do in bed. That is to say, they certainly have a right to privacy.   But the public would quite justifiably find it very strange to discover halfway through a political campaign that a politician was married, but had never revealed this fact. The public would think that this politician was keeping secrets, not guarding his privacy.   So by the same token, it's not OK to keep your sexuality a secret, although it is appropriate to maintain a sphere of privacy around the details of that sexuality.   urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Proposed Marriage Ban Splits Washington's Gays
