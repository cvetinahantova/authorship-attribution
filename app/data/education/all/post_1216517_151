EWCSD AND HEART DAY     I'm teaching third grade today.  I think that's my favorite.   urlLink This  is who I work for.  East Whittier City School District.  I'm been working a bit lately.  So that's cool.     My favorite game to play with the kids is 'Simon Says.'  Man, i've been playing that everyday.  That game is awesome.  I'll tell you what, there's some solid Simon Says gamers in East Whittier.      Valentine's Day is coming up.  I don't have a Valentine this year, not that I'm all that excited about the valentine's i've had in the past...  but moving on...  I was dating someone not too long ago, but I got burned in that situation.  It's interesting being on the other end of that for once.  Yeah, I'm serious.  It wasn't my fault this time. Kind of.  You can ask anybody.  I was responsible for dating her in the first place, so I've got to use better section powers next time, but out side of that...   I've realized that from all the relationships I've been in, that i've really learned what i DON'T want in a woman.  I know the possitives I'm looking for, but now I've got the negatives that I want to avoid down pat as well.  Also, I've realized that, until recently, I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a woman that would want to date me.  Big problem, huh?  Catch-22.  But I've been pretty proactive recently and have asked God to help me not be a dumbass.  Slowly but surely i'm being transformed and some Valentine's Day soon I'll be ready for my Valentine.
