Who is my god or goddess?   The GOD can be the universal superior or is it a female GOD that rules the solar system and unspeakable mystery of the hidden systems across the galaxies.  The God can be the world supervior or is it a Goddess that rules the planet of earth that celebrates the trinity of life air, water, and land.  The goddess can be the figure of paganism or is it really a male god that rules the spiritual, mystical, magical realm of each individuals may it be the goddess of ocean or the god of shark.  My GOD is a ghost of my past life memories My God is an unknown figure of my faith My goddess is the GODDESS of Fire, Pele who rules my everyday spiritual needs and wants.  May your chosen one become a map Guide you to the destiny of your purest soul.   ~kekua april 2004
