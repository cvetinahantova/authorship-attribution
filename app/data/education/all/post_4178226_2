CNN.com - Julia Child dead at 91 - Aug 13, 2004  : "(CNN) -- Julia Child, who revolutionized cooking in the United States with her cooking school, cookbooks and television shows, has died, according to a statement from her publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. She was 91."    OK, I know the lady was old (and has come across as   ancient   for quite awhile now), but it still saddens me that she has passed. Obviously, I am too young to have experienced "The French Chef." But when "Baking with Julia" was on PBS during the mid-90's, I was right there every Saturday afternoon, watching even when it was a repeat. I also bought the book, and I have   never   purchased a $40 PBS-related book, before or since! I still miss that show, and was secretly hoping for a follow-up.
