Shane's Download Of The Day    Today's Download is a download accelerator that speeds up downloads greatly, even on a broadband connection (which I have)   LeechGet 2004   LeechGet is an awesome  free  download accelerator that works great. It really helps speed up those large downloads (like a game trial) on a broadband connection (it might make those small downloads take longer on a broadband), and it speeds up almost every download on a dial-up connection amazingly. I have tried many download accelerators, and this one is by far the best. I reccomend it to anybody who downloads a lot of files   urlLink LeechGet 2004
