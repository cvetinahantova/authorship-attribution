I hate head colds.  This one has acutally been moving around- chest,  throat and head- currently residing in the left side of my head.  My only saving grace is that I can breath through the right side of my head.  Throat gunky- though not soar like it has been the past few days.  Living on tea today, tea and strawberry halls.  Yah for vapor action.  Also considering going home on lunch- i have vapor rub cream there and Loki didn't get brushed this morning.  Since I'm going to Phil's tonight and csi may come- though doubtful I think I'll run home.
