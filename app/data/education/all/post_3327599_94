soo today was pretty uneventful. i went to morris to get my dog. she's been awesome since she's been back. Sheila came over and fed my goats while i was gone.. silly girl..   i went over and hung out with Phil. first i had to get through the random ppl drinking on the porch with a half empty (or is it half full?) bottle of southern comfort. i only knew Heather and Jessica.. the 3 guys i have no clue who they were.. oh well.. and i met the nephew of the guy who lives down stairs. he was cool. eventually everyone left and Phil and i hung out until i had to go home which sucked cuz i don't like leaving.. lol.   anywho.. that was my whole day.. kinda sad when i see how short it was.. oh well.. i had fun and that's all that matters really.
