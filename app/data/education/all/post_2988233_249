While having our quiet time the other night, I mentioned to Tommy that I had heard from the local high school that day.  This confused my husband, I have forgotten to tell him I had called to ask about Driver's ed classed for our oldest.   He had also failed to realize we would have a freshman in high school in 2 weeks if he were in public school.    Freshman.  Me, Tommy, parents of a high schooler.  I for one know I am NOT old enough to have a high school kid.  I know this hit Tommy pretty hard.  Why, because he kept repeating, "high schooler" over and over.    All other things aside, you know mid life crisis, keeping a marriage alive, dealing with aging parents.  Nothing quite hits you in the gut like those words, "oh, our oldest starts high school this year"  BAM!  Right in the gut, all of the sudden the joints don't work like they used to.  Staying up past midnight takes days to recover from.  Playing football in the yard with the boys seems to inflict more injuries than normal, and not on the kids.  Conversations seem to turn more towards adult topics, then you realize "wait, this is my SON saying this stuff".  Where did the kids with the smile that went all over his face go to?  And why did this kid with a perma-scowl replace him?  We are lucky, the public school system does have to let him enroll in driver's ed with them.  Thank God.  He will start sometime in the fall, or early winter.  I am not ready for this.
