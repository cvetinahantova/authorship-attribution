The Honeymoon . Pretend that The Sundays had twins: a boy and a girl. The boy grew up liking French bands like Air and Phoenix. The girl claimed to idolize Nina Persson of The Cardigans, but secretly played Avril Lavingne and Hillary Duff in her room at night. One day these two pretty teens sneaked into the basement to record an album called   Dialogue  .  A few weeks ago  urlLink I alluded  to Sophia Coppola when describing The Honeymoon.  Boyohboy  was I wrong when I heard the full CD. They are way too poppy to be called indie. Sophia would not copy this CD for Marc Jacobs! Their new single "Truth Hurts" is a fine pop song, but the sickly sweet vocals, crunchy chords and the techno sheen over the music suggest that they have read the Matrix (producers of Lavigne and Duff) rule book and used every trick in one song.  "Passive Aggressive" remains a favorite of the year for me - the title reveals it self in the fucked up romance of the lyrics. "I Don't Know What To Say" merges verses reminiscent of Corey Hart with a chorus straight from Enya. "Come Undone" is an ode to their "parents", The Sundays, but with trippier production. I am not sure these two have a big future. Methinks  Dialogue  will be their only CD, but I heartily recommend it. They are neither indie enough or pop enough to fare well inthis black and white world, so maybe they can produce better songs for the tweenyboppers on the radio.
