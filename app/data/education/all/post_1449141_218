From the Nation  The White House--at least in public--doesn't seem willing to do much to determine whether Bush Administration officials blew the cover of an undercover CIA operative in order to mount a political hit job.  For the story, read David Corn's new Capital Games: http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid=845  As Corn reported in his weblog last week, a July 14 column by conservative journalist Robert Novak indicated that two unnamed "senior administration officials" had undermined national security and perhaps broken the law by revealing to Novak that the wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson IV was a deep-cover CIA officer.  Wilson is the envoy the CIA sent to Niger in February 2002 to check out the allegation that Saddam Hussein had tried to buy uranium there. He reported back that the charge was probably false. Earlier this month, he went public and challenged the Bush Administration's account of the Niger episode. As Corn shows, the Novak article--which revealed the name of Wilson's wife and reported she worked in the important area of weapons counterproliferation--had the stench of White House revenge and intimidation.  Read Corn's new report to see how far this White House appears willing to go to squelch criticism.
