So while I was off, I was beginning to get some sleep at night (well for 2 of them anyway) but I was definately getting more relaxed. Two days back at work and here I am at 02:30 again - wide awake. A pattern has been emerging since the weekend as the prospect of going back to work got closer.  Interestingly I didn't identify work as a problem area in my original lists. I thought I had got over a fairly significant "rough patch" from this avenue of my life. So why does it seem to be such a big issue again now? Is there a real problem there or am I creating one again due to the way I feel?
