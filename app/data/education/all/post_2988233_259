Bedtime is my favorite time of day.  Most parents hate bedtime.  All the drinks of water, trips to the potty, monsters in the closet, you name it, every excuse known to man comes to mind at bedtime.  Not at our house.  When Noah was born, we lived in a 2 bedroom trailer.  If you have never lived in a trailer, they are ovens inthe summer time, and freezers in the winter.  We had a window air conditioner in our living room, so in the summer months, we would bring our kingsized matress into the living room and sleep there in front of the air conditioner.  They boys would all pile on the couch, or in bed with us.  Picture it, all 7 of us sleeping in the living room every night.     We co-slept with all of our kids, when they were babies.  breastfeeding has its advantages!  Each one, would one day decided he didn't want to sleep with mom and dad anymore, usually around the time another brother was born.  I guess it just got too crowded.    When we moved into our house, Noah was 2 weeks old.  Tj and Jamie shared a room, Casey and Will shared a room, and Noah was with us.  That lasted maybe a week.    The boys had gotten used to sleeping in the same room as us.  At first, they would go to sleep in their beds, then at some point during the night, move to the  floor by our bed.  Then, they would ask to sleep in the floor in our room, so we would let them fall asleep there, and move them when we went to bed.  But they would just wind up in our floor again.  Finally, we broke down and bought each boy a portable cot, camping cot, whatever you want to call it.  So now,  when it is bedtime, they fix their spots beside our bed, they rotate who sleeps at the foot, and on each side.    Why is this my favorite time of day?  Because who ever is sleeping beside me, will always slip his had up beside me, and search for my hand.  That is how I fall asleep each night holding hands with one of my babies.
