COOL!!  I personally thought the Concert Companion was remarkable.  I would love to attend a symphony concert but am reluctant because my wife has very little music background and would not enjoy a long performance of Beethoven's 9th.  I, on the other hand, would.  The concert companion would allow her (and me too for that matter) to access information regarding the orchestra, the piece of music, and other important information to make her feel engaged in the performance.  I can see this opening up a whole new audience to the symphony orchestra.  The other gadgets were neat too.  It is yet to be seen if they will "catch on" and become standards in the U.S.  I thought the toilet was a little much.  I mean, come on, who needs a remote to raise the seat and/or flush the toilet?  I can certainly see the need for a cell phone that helps eliminate background noise.  I often see people in the airport talking on the phone with one finger crammed in their ear, cell phone smashed against the other, and the grimaced face of "What did you just say?!"  It would bring a whole new meaning to the phrase, "Can you hear me now?".  BC
