urlLink SCIFI.COM | Battlestar Galactica  I am too excited to write about information literacy.  A new version of  Battlestar Galactica  is premiering tonight on TV as a mini-series.  I loved  Galactica  when I was growing up.  It dominated my fantasy life in the late 70s.  I imagined I was an 8 year old viper pilot fighting the Cylons...  If you have read my blog for awhile, you know I have a site that talks about  urlLink Battlestar Galactica and Mormonism . I will of course be looking for this.  However, I know that a 25 year updating of this show will mean major changes.  I don't care.  I love the concept behind this show so much that I will watch it regardless of how much is different.  And if it is any good, I will hope that it becomes a new regular series.
