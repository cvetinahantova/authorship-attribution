For the small group of people who say they haven't adopted "because they just haven't gotten around to it yet" (I think 35 or so), the only variable that is significant in separating them from people who don't seem to be at all interested is --  curiosity . Technology discomfort, technology optimism, proactive coping, age and even internet self-efficacy (the belief that one could learn the internet if one wanted) aren't related to a continuing interest in adoption (expressed as the belief that they just haven't gotten around to it yet). Education also isn't statistically significant at p  Curiosity also predicts number of online uses; however, it doesn't predict time spent online each week however.  Only internet self-efficacy (even after including internet skill) was related to amount of time spend online each week.  Given that curiosity as we measure it here is a "general" personality variable, it's interesting that it is implicated in several "stories" here.
