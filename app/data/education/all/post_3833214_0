This is the quickest post ever!  Not much time left on our card for internet access!  We are in Pompei but leave tomorro for Brindisi (keep your fingers crossed for us as there is A LOT of travelling to be done tomorrow.)  We've seen lots and lots but we want to write about it in more detail, so just bear with us.  When we arrive in Corfu, we'll update the site properly!  Claire and Gemma xxx
