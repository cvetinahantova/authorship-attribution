Looking back at what I wrote last night made me wonder how I could come up with so much to write about for so long. I was typing for an hour straight and I didn't stop until I just couldn't keep my eyes open, I'm a completely different person when I'm tired. I think I'll regret what I posted last night, but oh well, no one else's fault other than mine ^^. I'm kinda glad I wrote so much, I don't remember anything I was talking about... So it's gonna be one of those unexplainable things where it makes complete sense to me when I type it but afterwards I won't be sure how it came to me. Maybe I'll eventually make this Blog informative of something that acually tells about me, or anything in that area of stuff 0.o... Anyways, on to something more Christmasy, considering that Christmas is in fact coming. This means buying presents for the loved ones, I don't know if I come off as the "loves to walk around looking for presents they won't be emotionally scarred by for the remainder of their life" type of person.   I lost my train of thought and have gone blank and I'm suddenly really frickin tired, guess I shouldn't have stayed up so late last night. All that just may be a sign to... um... stop, I'm tired of typing anyways. Ok then, GOODBYE.
