Went to IKEA last night to get some ideas on bedroom decorations. It might come in useful when I'm settling down in Korea.      Was talking with Wai Nyan this afternoon concerning pirated stuff. It seems that if I were to talk any longer with him on this topic, he might just be able to convince me not to use pirated goods.   I never gave so much thoughts about pirated things before this. It just seem ok to use them. Well, maybe when I'm financially secure I'll go against piracy. But not at the moment.    Seems strange that many people are studying the book of Ecclesiastes. First was during last year's church camp, now SIB KL, then this afternoon Wai Nyan told me his cf(if I'm not mistaken) is doing(or is it did) the same book as well.   It's true that sometimes life just seem so meaningless......at the end of the day all things lead to the grave.......why then do we study so much,why watch movie,why why why??.......ther's war going on, people are dying.....yet I'm here writting my blog....   Maybe we'll know the meaning of life when we see it from above the sun, but currently I'm not able to do so, yet.   So, all I can do is trust in HIM to lead me....    Was talking to my friends just now. Seems that I have a lot to catch up in my studies. I've not been working so hard since the orientation.   Will try to come up with a timetable so that my time can be more organized. Better get the stone rolling and catch up on momentum....
