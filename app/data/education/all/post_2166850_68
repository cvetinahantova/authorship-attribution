yup, had a haircut last night by my mum, which i always think is less than satisfactory, but last night's one was ok, and i guess that u cannot really blame her for always cutting my hair wrong coz that curly tuft of hair on my crown is any amateur barber's nightmare, so it is quite a commendable effort, problem is my parents dont wana spend too much for me to go to barbershops for a haircut, but well, yeah i have 4 siblings, so i can understand, but i shall wait until i am old enuf to get the barbers to do a good job, but thanks anyway mum... i finally started my damn homework today, but i realise that i have so much to do, so i really need to buck up, anyway i might post another message later, so stay tuned...
