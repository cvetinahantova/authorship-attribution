urlLink Mark Morford  has written  urlLink an article  in the  San Francisco Chronicle  about  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 .  Seems to strike the right balance between criticising Moore for his propaganda and complimenting what he has achieved.  A friend sent me a link to a  urlLink flash game .  I don't get it.  Today's  urlLink Guardian  has an article on some  urlLink alternative treks to the Inca Trail around Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia .  I'm spending alot of time on the train at the moment, so I've just ordered a few CDs from  urlLink Amazon  to put on my new little  urlLink MP3 player .   urlLink Franz Ferdinand ,  urlLink Scissor Sisters  and  urlLink The Streets .  Hmm, they are all in Amazon's  urlLink top 5  sellers.  How "with it" am I?
