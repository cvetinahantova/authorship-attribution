Reviewing what Carole wrote reminded me to comment on our family mealtimes. It seemed for a while that we were eating together even less often than we had been before the holiday - we spent a few days away with friends (who incidentally were eating together more now - their son is old enough to mess up the "grown-up" mealtimes they used to have once their children were in bed - so that was progress for them [and also incidentally we met Aidan Severs and Alison at St. Thomas' in Lancaster when we went with our friends on the Sunday after Carey - should have mentioned that before - small world {or big family}]).  But then when we got home, we just didn't sit down together at all, it seemed. So we made a slightly more conscious effort - which did lead to some times of "family tension", notably on the Sunday (what is it about Sunday lunches? I know - it's that they are an hour later than normal, and people's blood-sugar gets low. Either that or it's a good time for Satan to undermine God's gift to us in the preceding couple of hours. Or both.) but did at least have us eating together! We have used the opportunity of the Olympics to have "family fun" in front of the television, which basically involves us all cheering "Freddy! Freddy!" or "Teddy! Teddy!" at any British competitors that are taking part, with the odd scream thrown in for good measure. What a blessing a detached house is.
