Suckage   Well I got the base table done. There was a bit of a problem yesterday with a bug in the indexing routine, but that got fixed.  Now  the problems start - I fond out that the table implementation in FxRuby is quite limited, and that even though I can make a cell  look  like a button, I cannot make it  behave  like one. It can't send click events, nor can it display tooltips. Well, maybe I can try to have it inherit its methods... But I don't know how that will affect the table yet, and I got other things to worry about. Like the three papers I have to finish today. Got one 1/5 done. In the mean time -  urlLink The Exorcist in 30 seconds . With bunnies.
