In the past few days, I've been feeling very old.  It started the other night, when I was talking to Kristen.  We were talking about all sorts of things when she mentioned that she had been house hunting.  As in she's looking to buy a house.  That just stopped me dead in my tracks.  Now, I feel like I've really been making some good steps in my life lately.  I'm settling into a job that I like, I'm looking at starting my Master's Degree, and I'm just feeling very comfortable about where things stand in my life.  But the idea of buying a house?!  That's just so... Inconceivable to me.  I can't even imagine *thinking* about buying a house.    Then today, Erin called.  As we were talking, she was telling me about all of the things that she's planning for her wedding next summer.  That, in and of itself, didn't faze me, because she's been planning this wedding for what seems like a decade.  They've literally been engaged for at least four years, However, when it really hit me that she was getting married next summer, and not at some distant "someday" date, I was suddenly amazed.    It's not just people who I knew that were a few years older than me settling down in their lives anymore.  Now it's my friends--people the same age as me.  They're getting married, and buying houses, and generally establishing themselves.  And that gets me wondering how I feel about doing that in my own life.  Just how content am I about where I am right now?  Hmm... definitely something to think about.
