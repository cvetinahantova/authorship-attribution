Happy Independence Day to all you Americans out there.  This is a purely American holiday that falls in the perfect time of year. I know the founding fathers didn't really plan it this way, but this holiday really couldn't fall in a better place on the calendar.  It really starts off the summer on the right foot.  I love the reflection on our history along with the general laid back attitude that goes along with what's typically a lazy summer day.  Also seeing fireworks is still as breathtaking as it was when I was a little kid.  Give it up for Independence, Freedom, Life, Liberty, and Happiness (as well as the pursuit thereof).
