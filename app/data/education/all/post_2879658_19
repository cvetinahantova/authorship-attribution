JUST ANOTHER RANDOM QUIZ...      So I was entertaining myself on Stephs site and happened to come across this quiz.  If you too are looking for a couple minutes of entertainment, enjoy!   BUD LIGHT: You're laid back and low maintenance - a people-person, who wants everyone else to be having as much fun as you are.  You make friends and jokes easily, and though you're definitely a smart ass, you're good-natured. Every man's beer for everyone's friend.    urlLink   The Greatest Beer Quiz, ever!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
