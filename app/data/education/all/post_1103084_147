................... post it notes ...................  have you seen the thing where people cover an office door or a cubicle in post it notes -- that say something?  or make a design with color?   is there a verb form for that kind of minor office terrorism?   like t.p.ing with toilet paper?   when lynn was a high school english teacher, one night one of her favorite classes celebrated the end of a unit on Romeo and Juliet by plastic forking the pages of the play across our entire lawn in the middle of the night.  You literally couldn't see any grass at all.   Ritual House Assault, my pop culture mentor, Jack Santino at BGSU called it.   Just like the time that our neighbors subtly expressed their dissatisfaction by filling our mailbox with grass when our lawn had gotten much longer than it should have (during the writing of our dissertation).   Santino said it was the equivalent of burning in effigy back in the day when people used to publicly sanction extra-marital affairs or unfair social policy.  there's something glorious about office pranks, though, when they instruments of oppression to subvert the grind...  anyone?  postiting? (feels awkwardly like prostating to me -- and yes, i mean prostating not prostrating...)  curious ~
