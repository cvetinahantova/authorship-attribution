The bus trip was more interesting and amazing than horrifying. It was unbelievable how the firestorm went through the neighbourhood, hitting some houses and sparing others. We tried to take pictures but it was hard because it was getting dark and we couldn't get off the bus so there was a lot of reflection from the window.  They are planning to allow residents back in the neighbourhood on Friday so I will post some before and after pics for you on the weekend.  A few days ago, all the families from the area went to a local church where we found out whose homes had burned and whose were saved.  When fire chief Gerry Zimmerman entered the room, we gave him a standing ovation.  It was the most touching moment of the evening.  It was hard to actually realize that the house was truly gone but when you see the address in black and white, it's pretty clear.  My mom  was packing before she was even on alert.  She rented a 4X6 storage unit and hauled all her photo albums and momentos from her trips plus all the obvious things one would take.  She forgot a few things though, like her wedding dress and our family's favourite Christmas record albums that we will miss  lot.
