Today is quite an unusual day for me. I had my lessons sqapped and I have to teach in the afternoon session. finally got an opportunity to sleep in...haha..Got woke up by Pastor Wallace when he called. Praise God that he came to Singapore and Eillen and I managed to break the news about us to him here,rather than wait till she goes back to waverly. Eileen went to the US embassy in the morning and finally got hte approval for the visa. She is comfirmed leaving for the States now. Time to get myself ready for her to leave. Still, I'm quite excited for this weekend to come. I'll be meeting Eileen's parents for dinner....stressed....I hope I'll do ok. Don't want to mess up the first meeting. Anyway, Better make sure I don't talk so much nor EAT too much..haha....oh well...time to get back to work...going fo rcell later...tolong for the rain to stop...
