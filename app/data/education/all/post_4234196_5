Mr. Jewett and I were teaching some basic graphics using the "Fireworks" program in our second period class this morning.  We were having the class experiment with different effects on their brushes, drawing weird and interesting colors and shapes.  Two girls in the class had the program open, but were talking, instead of working.  I went over and said, "Come on you two, let's see some brush strokes on your screen."  One girl, C., said, "Oh, Mr. Burkhard, I am going to write you a message!"  She proceeds to pick up her mouse and, in bright red on a yellow background, begins to spell out "LO..."  I start to get a little worried, thinking about the seen in the Indiana Jones movie where the girl writes "I LOVE YOU" on her eyelids and then bats her eyes at the teacher.  She reaches for the mouse again as I start to sweat.  She quickly finishes off her message by writing "...SER."  "LOSER."  Oh, that makes me feel better.  She has a smug air about her.  I stick my tongue out at her and walk away.  I am taking into account the fact that girls her age are naturally mean and am trying not to take it personally.  My response was undoubtedly not the best, but I couldn't think of anything else to say!
