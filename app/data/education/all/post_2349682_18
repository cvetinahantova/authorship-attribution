I got to go out tonight!! We went to the mall, woo hoo! I was totally getting ready for a night with pizza and a movie but Cassy asked if we could go to the mall so she could hang out with her friends, that's the only way she could go out. Well I had a fifty dollar gift certificate from the Chandler mall so I was like sure. I got an outfit (jeans and a shirt with a scarf) lotion at Bath and Body, and makeup at Clinque. I think I did pretty well if I say so myself. Cassy went to go see 50 first dates with a friend, and I was people watching for an hour. I can't believe some of the lines that guys use to pick up girls, I wanted to go ask them if those lines actually worked by I decided not to because I didn't want to be given a line.  I just keep hearing Don't Hate, Don't Hate! I don't hate the player, I just hate the game, cuz that's all it is. Granted friday nights are junior high beginning of high school nights at the mall but still. It was sad to see these junior high/high school girls dressing to express but impressing the wrong kind of guys. I just had to sit and pray for a bit because I could have started to cry, or gotten really mad. But I like Cassy's friends they keep it real! They were very nice to me even though I am the old one. And afterwards Cassy started talking a lot more to me! I guess it just shows you that you kind of have to go and play on their level a bit. Well I am glad that we had this week because now I can understand a little bit more of how the youth's lives are like and what they go through during a week. And how to take someone not talking as a challenge instead of a cut down to you, you really can't be offended that teenagers don't talk, they just don't know what to talk about and sometimes we don't either! I am glad that I had this experience and that I didn't give up.
