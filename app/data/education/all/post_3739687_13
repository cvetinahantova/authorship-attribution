hey,  sorry for the generalization.  i know not all french people suck, but the party last night turned out to be nancy, me, and a bunch of french people.  they were o.k. at first, but then politics entered the picture.  what's amazing is that i agree with them on most of what they were discussing about bush and the abu gahrib (spelling?) prison abuse scandal, etc...  anyway... they still seemed very attacking.  so since they generalized me i'm just  going to assume they are all shitty.  o.k. enough negative now on to positive.  a few of them were very nice and friendly and when they weren't lapsing into french we had very good conversations.  also, they enjoyed the wines i brought.  which were a couple of australian syrahs. all in all i had a good time vs. a bad time.  i'm planning on moving into vicky's place sunday and then my room will be available on friday.  i'm excited about having a place to call my own.  what's also great is that since it's basically a hotel with special deals for st. joe teachers i get my room cleaned for free.  i'm going to be so spoiled when i get back to the states.  which if i stay as happy as i am now it might not be for awhile.  well gotta go.  jane
