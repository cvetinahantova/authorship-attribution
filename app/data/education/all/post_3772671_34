Had a great time this weekend--friends took us boating on the Snake. We toodled around Lewiston and Clarkston and down to Asotin. There was a weird, nearly mythological scene: a bird of prey of some kind attacking a young blue heron. My friends were afraid that it was going to get the heron, but it didn't.   Once the sun set, we watched the fireworks over Lewiston and Clarkston. Very impressive, except that that they were choreographed to nasty music: country settings of Bush sounding presidential. We actually heard the same song in Safeway the other day, and a friend asked if we were in East Germany, what with all this propaganda bombarbing us.   Late in the evening, we headed back to Chief Timothy Reservoir, where we had parked the pick-up. Its lights didn't work, so we had to camp, impromptu. We had a bottle of wine, and then tried to sleep in the boat and the back of the pick-up for a couple of hours, until daybreak. It was a memorable finish to a wonderful day.  I can't say I felt proud to be an American--after all, what did I do to become an American? But I did feel lucky to live in such a beautiful country.
