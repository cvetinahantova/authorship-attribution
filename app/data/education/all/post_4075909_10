When my dogs, (and I have three), go to the vet, she gives them a shot if they hurt their knees.  When humans have the same problem, they go to the doctor and the trouble begins.  This weekend my father went because he pulled a muscle when doing exercises the chirpractor gave him, (another word for dumb).  His whole knee blew up.  The doctors have no idea where it came from and won't comment.  We then went to CVS to fill his pills and because of this great country NOT having a health care plan, (who cares about paying more taxes?  I'd rather have my health and meds), he had to pay out of pocket and get this, he is an insurance agent.  Although he is much better, I am tired from having to drive him around.  This gives me a new respect for cab drivers.  So, now instead of seeing the chiropractor, I went out to Linen 'n Things and bought a shiatsu massaging cushion.  It works the same way.  Case closed.  Now, I'm going to go to sleep because I have not gotten any in two days.  This is after I watch k.d. lang on the Today Show.  But, before, all of you out there buying from me on amazon.com, please, I do not bite, if there is a problem with the tape, email me for a full refund.
