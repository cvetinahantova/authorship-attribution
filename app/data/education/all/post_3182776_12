I'm feeling quite murderous right now.   The folk in the flat upstairs have got an outlet pipe from their bathroom that pops out of the wall right above my window, and, for some reason, water has started pissing out of it for  hours  at a time, day and night AND IT'S DRIVING ME  CRAZY!   In the night-time, it makes me wake up dying for the loo. I'm surprised I haven't actually wet myself yet. In the day, it's like a form of fucking Chinese water torture. Except for that you get to go to China, at least. I'm sure psychological torment and sleep deprivation are much more bearable when you're not trying to compose lesson plans in a poky flat in the East End.  I'm off to sharpen the kitchen knives. I may get back to you soon.
