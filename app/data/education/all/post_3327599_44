Phil and i went to see dodgeball tonight. it was sooo funny Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are so awesome. and if you go see it wait through the credits.. the ending is a little disturbing but it's worth it! and then went to dinner and Phil was sooo flirting with the carl's jr lady.. see if i make him any more cookies..   i'm tired. and the boys are fighting over who gets the computer when i leave.. maybe i'll just babble some more so they get to sleepy to want to be on it.. definetly helps wtih the fighting lol. john is using big words to confuse andrew.. like.. shwah.. haha.. and circumsize oh wait maybe it was circumstantial... huh.. oh well.. i just hear what i want! haha. poor andrew..
