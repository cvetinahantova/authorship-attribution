Well our house is slowly being Martiefied!!!  Very exciting.  I have decided I just love Martie, she has made our house look AMAZING!  I wish that I had more time to help out.  But I can't wait to have every thing settled, so that we can have ourselves a little house warming party!! :)  Everyone is invited.  Right now the living room is almost done, we still have one chair to move in.  The Dining room is shaping up, and so is the kitchen.  It is all very exciting.  Every time I come home or wake up in the morning I look forward to seeing all that is done!!  Or what new thing was moved.  What is not exciting is that it's a training week!! BLAH, and we are so freakin behind it's not even funny!!  Like for real a day behind!! EEK.  I'm not sure how I'm going to get everyone all caught up.  Anyway so that is a little stressful.  That and trying to get everything that I need for my room.  It's still a mess.  And I've been going to bed around 1 every night, because I've been out shopping, cleaning the old house (in c-town), or organizing my own room.  Well that and I rented Sex and the City and have been watching that because we don't have cable yet and the 2 channels we have right now are fuzzy.  So anyway I keep busy...LOL.   We get Internet on FRIDAY!!!!! I can't wait.  Okay well that's all for now.  Ttyl
