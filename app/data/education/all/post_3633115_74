I have to thank  urlLink Rose  for giving the best explanation for missing items in the dryer.  This notification followed a comment I left on  urlLink Joelle's  site to her post "Free Range".  Anyway, here is Rose's response.   Re: Gretchen’s comment, many years ago I heard a FABULOUS explanation for the socks in the dryer syndrome.  1) God is omnipotent.  2) Therefore, God must see, hear, and know all things.  3) Under the “if a tree falls in the woods and there’s no one there to hear it” theory, in essence if God no longer had knowledge of something, it would cease to exist.  POOF!  4) While the socks are spinning around really fast in the dryer, God occasionally loses track of one of them.  5) POOF!  And then occasionally God will remember that one sock, which is why you sometimes find them two weeks later under your bed.   This explains so much!
