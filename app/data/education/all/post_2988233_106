We are going to do a benefit singing for Savannah and the expenses that come with a liver transplant.    It is exciting to start planning this.  It makes the transplant so much more real.    I talked to Renee, and it is ok for anyone who wants to link Savannah's page on their blog.  The more traffic we get on this, the better.  I will keep  posting updates, and I know Renee will keep Savannah's site updated as much as possible.  Or, you can always email me at arogers33@charter.net, I will be glad to answer any questions, forward prayers, anythign I can do.    As you can tell, this little girl is a very loved little girl.    I can honestly tell you, the first time Renee placed Savannah in my arms, she was 6 weeks old.  She stole my heart.  That precious little bundle just took a peice of my heart right then and there.  I have never loved a child, that wasn't my own, as much as I love Savannah.  She does that to everyone who meets her.  As Jenn said, she has this infectious smile, and It jsut steals your heart.    I will be so glad when she can eat and drink anything she wants.  And when her life can be normal.
