We are the Reason  Gary Valenciano  As little children we would dream of Christmas morn  And all the gifts and toys  We knew we'd find, but we never realized  A baby boy, one blessed night  Gave us the greatest gift of our life   Chorus:  We are the reason that He gave His life  We are the reason Jesus suffered and died  To a world that was lost  He gave all He could give  To show us the reason to live   As the years went by, we learned more of our gifts  And giving of ourselves and what they mean  On a dark and cloudy day  A man hung dying in the rain  Because of love, because of love  Because of love   Chorus:  We are the reason that He gave His life  We are the reason why the Lord suffered and died  To a world that was lost  He gave all He could give  To show us the reason to live  To live...  To live...   Coda:  Every time I see the cross  I'm reminded that He gave His  life  For you and me...   Chorus:  We are the reason that He gave His life  We are the reason Jesus suffered and died  To a world that was lost  He gave all He could give  To show us the reason to live   We are the reason but  He is the reason we live  Thank you, my Jesus  Thank you, Jesus  I thank you, Lord, my Jesus  We thank you, Jesus  For God so saved the world...  (Jesus)  (Thank you)  (You're worthy to be praised...)  (The name above all names)   		  Do you Yahoo!? Friends.  Fun.  urlLink Try the all-new Yahoo! Messenger
