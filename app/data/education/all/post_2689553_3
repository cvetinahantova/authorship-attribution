I've been sitting here in homeroom now, for like five, 10 minutes.  Not that terribly interesting.  I've had trips to the dentist less boring.  Although the announcements were okay.  Except for when the principals on.  All his announcements sound so...prefabricated, almost like a mad libs game...something like:  "Good Morning, just a few quick announcements, the first thing today is (insert announcement here).  A quick comment for (insert class here) (insert announcement here). And the big news is (insert announcement here). Thank you, have a good day.‚Äù  As you can see, this gets very mundane and boring.  But some things, you just got to live with.
