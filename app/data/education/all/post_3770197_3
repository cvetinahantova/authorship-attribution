Yeah. I find this much more simplistic than Xanga. The crappy part about it all, is the constant uploading of pictures and how they never turn up with you insert their link. And well, this seems more personal because i've been real hesitant with what I write and I don't seem to be as honest because of what people would say. But now... everything is going to be blunt and out in the open. Geez, it almost sounds as if I'm coming out of the closet or something.. but I'm not.. yet. ;) On another note, while we're on the subject of gay people. My best friend, Travis (who's gay) is leaving for the AF, and I'm going to miss him terribly. He's like my soulmate..    Travis, baby, I'm going to miss you so much. Please becareful and come back safe.
