Maybe the things that no one wants to say or face are the things that could help things the most. I hope people will forgive me and I can get on with everything. Lack of communication kills things and I know that I am never gonna be in a utopia and that you have to play with the cards that life gives you, and I am getting to where i am glad to work with it at points.
