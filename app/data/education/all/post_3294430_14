i wore the gi and hakama for the first time today. heavy and tight at the chest area. but very free at the legs. surprisingly it gave me very good posture and i felt more control in my suburi. well that is until before fatigue sets in. needs to strengthen my body and mind. well no more procrastinating my goal is to lose excess weight so that i can tie a bow knot at the back instead of a reef knot. tomorrow is day one of exercise and diet regime.
