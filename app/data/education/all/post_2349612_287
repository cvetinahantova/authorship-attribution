g-ma (the one i just saw yesterday) was put in the hospital this afternoon.  they're concerned about a sore on her foot that's healing weird (and she's diabetic so they take longer to heal) and not getting better how it should... dad, who took the message while mom was out, was very mellodramatic about it like something horrible is going to happen... mom's convinced it's just a preventative measure  mom flew back to memphis last night... she expected dad and ryan to pick her up in her van, which they did.. but 5 miles away from the airport the van made a horrendous popping noise (which they later discovered was the transmission completely dying)... they miraculously made it to the airport passenger loading area, where it died... it was 2am before they all got home... mom got a new car today -- a 1997 chevy blazer.  and then there's me... for not seeing anyone all day, i sure do write a lot... i don't know what to make of the g-ma story... but i've given plenty of my thoughts on her already this weekend... i guess we just gotta see what happens... and i'm meanwhile i'm having a delightful time avoiding the world -- spaghetti and watching "miss congeniality" on TV  later dudes
