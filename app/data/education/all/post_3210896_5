Well, the folks over at  urlLink Six Apart  released the new  urlLink Movable Type v3.0  today. Needless to say, it was a long time coming. However, it went over like a lead brick. It seems like they've thrown a wrench into the gears  by putting a price tag on certain "levels" of the once free-for-all system.  I'm pretty happy with  urlLink Blogger  right now. I'm not doing much with my site for the time being, since I don't have a PC at home.  urlLink Phil  says I need to switch to  urlLink Mambo . That thing is loaded! The folks at Slash Dot recommend Word Press.  It makes me wonder what  urlLink the 5th dentist  thinks of it all...
