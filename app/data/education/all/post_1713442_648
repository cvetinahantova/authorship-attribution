urlLink Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 1: Research Findings. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Grouws, Douglas A. and Cebulla, Kristin J.   From the ERIC Digest:  The number of research studies conducted in mathematics education over the past three decades has increased dramatically (Kilpatrick, 1992). Research findings indicate that certain teaching strategies and methods are worth careful consideration as teachers strive to improve their mathematics teaching practices. For the classroom implications of the research findings summarized here, please see the companion to this Digest, "Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 2: Recommendations for the Classroom" (EDO-SE-00-10)   1. The extent of the students' opportunity to learn mathematics content bears directly and decisively on student mathematics achievement.   Opportunity to learn (OTL) was studied in the First International Mathematics Study (Husen, 1967), where teachers were asked to rate the extent of student exposure to particular mathematical concepts and skills. Strong correlations were found between OTL scores and mean student achievement scores, with high OTL scores associated with high achievement. The link was also found in subsequent international studies, such as the Second International Mathematics Study (McKnight et al., 1987) and the Third International Mathematics and Science study (TIMSS) (Schmidt, McKnight, & Raizen, 1997).   2. Focusing instruction on the meaningful development of important mathematical ideas increases the level of student learning.   There is a long history of research, going back to the work of Brownell (1945,1947), on the effects of teaching for meaning and understanding. Investigations have consistently shown that an emphasis on teaching for meaning has positive effects on student learning, including better initial learning, greater retention and an increased likelihood that the ideas will be used in new situations.
