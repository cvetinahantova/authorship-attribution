In the general climate of pan-hellenic euphoria after the 1-1 draw against Spain,  I think that Otto Rehhagel, coach of our national soccer team, should be our next president of the hellenic republic.  He deserves it 100%.  Mostly, because he took a bunch of overpaid, under-stimulated, super-egotistical players and turned them into a superb fighting team.  Be on the lookout now for the final match against Russia on Sunday, when a draw is enough to  send Greeks into the second round, and an entire country into pandaemonium.  Cheers, and as the Greek fans chant: Είναι τρελός, είναι τρελός ο Γερμανός (He is crazy, the German is crazy)...  Ioannis, 200040616211000
