---------------Sup Kids-------------------------------- So, a new week. i haven't made anew post in two weeks, and i was about topost one about the trade between HOU and ORL, but eh. Afer Stevie met magic management, my post would've made me look completely foolish. Or just exemplify it. Anyways, On with the Program!!!!! ----------Welcome to the H.R., B****------------------- This year, the mayor of my fine hometown of Chesapeake, Va-William E.Ward (or is that homeowner guy?)-is retiring, after a decade and a half of service (not coincidentally, i was born around the time he started). This means that an "election" will be held at many  schools, tax-exemption buildings called churches, and random peoples' garages and carports. So it is, but i do wish one thing upon the election: do not follow the steps of knoxville, tn. Last november, there was an election,in about the same circumstance in k-town, with long-time headman Victor Ashe (now the US Ambassador to Poland-TRUE!) retiring, to go to Poland. A lot. anyways, the election wound down to two front-runners: the conservative Bill haslam(President of Midwestern gas-sation giant Pilot)and the liberal-leading Madeline Rogero. (there is no party-affiliation allowed). It's not that a conservative is a bad thing, but the Pilot Oil Company iIS based on Knoxville. Which means that people here vote like people in California-with fear. CA-they vote for the Terminator (yeah Jadakiss, why did they let the Terminator win the election? Fear. and no info.) b/c  they don't know who to vote for and waiters-i mean actors/hollywood run the state. even in fresno. and here, they vote for the guy because he runs an oil company! also, if you guess the banner on july 6 on my blog's frontpage, i'll write about your topic. submit your entries in the comments section!
