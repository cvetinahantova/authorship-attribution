If my little sister doesn't STOP playing the saxophone in the same room as the computer, I may have to pack my bags "and run to the next village, do shit and come back again!". Sidmouth people know what I'm talking about!!!   Anyways, It's really loud and noisy, and I'm trying to type and I can't with that racket going on behind me. Especially when she can't get it quite right, and it's almost there..... BUT NOT QUITE. Annoying or what?    I do like the saxophone (a little bit, seeing as loads of friends paly it, and enjoy playing it), just not too loud, and well..... loud!!!   HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE???? That's what she's playing at the moment. It's actaully making me type faster, it's quite strange!!!   There is a good point for the loudness. It makes me jumpy and nervous, and type faster! KEEP ON ROCKING SUSIE!!!!!!
