i was a complete and total putz all day yesterday... slept til lunchtime, wasted time online, read a bit, did word puzzles, developed pictures (more llamas  here  :-P ), and finally, brother and me went to see a movie: king arthur.  i don't like bloody/battle movies very much, but i enjoyed this one... it was more centered on the relationships between people rather than on "let's see how much blood/gore we can make"... so somehow that made it more watchable for me... guinevere kicked butt too :-P  all in all, enjoyed it and glad we went.  now, went to the traditional church service with dad already this morning, and in an hour am going to the contemporary service with my brother (mom plays organ/keyboard for both and the guys both just go to one or the other)... this is one thing i love about good shepherd that's weird here... both services have the same worship style each particular week, but both services rotate between different worship styles and liturgy sources... there's not this chasm of "contemporary people" and "traditional people" like even just in my family... blah.  more this evening... later dudes! =P
