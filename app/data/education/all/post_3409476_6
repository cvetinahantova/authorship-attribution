Wow, I didnt realize how interested everyone was in Adam's baseball career.  Ok, I found out about Clevland about a week and a hlaf ago.  The city of Glendale is sponsoring a team.  I have not heard back yet about the playing time.  TOnight we fill out information and find out about flight information.    As for the link, you can only make it a link on a PC.  All this really cool stuff like font and everything is not available on a MAC, which is what I have at work.
