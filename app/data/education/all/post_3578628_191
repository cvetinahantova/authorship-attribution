Ok so I went to sleep at 4:00 last night.  My fault, my fault.  No one to blame for that.  Not much on TV.  Reruns of the home run derby and Sportscenter till like 3.  Then that's pretty much it.  Some pretty good infomercials.  I asking for the Turbo Cooker for Christmas, and the set of steak knives.  I just wanna be able to say "hey I cut up this dinner with my steak knives and cooked it in the Turbo Cooker."  That'd be cool.  Anyway so went to sleep at 4.  It's 5:30 my mom comes busting in.  5:30.  That's 90 mins of sleep.  "Help, we need help outside."  I need help sleeping mom, but w/e.  Apparently my dad's car stalled or something on the way to work in the middle of the street.  So we had to push it to the curb.  That was cool.  I didn't have any shoes on.  Fun stuff.  SO I have to go to drum lessons today right? Well I was gonna drive out there with my FRESHLY ACQUIRED DRIVER'S LICENSE.  Opps, my dad's takin my car to work.  Smooth.  Nothing better than having a license for like 4 days and not being able to drive right away.  grrrrrr. ok so came back in from pushing, went to sleep.  Got up this morning for a haircut.  9:00 for that.  so, that's like less than 5 hrs. of sleep. Spencer's takin a nap later!!!  But, while I've been home, I've had some free time.  Nick Slauson sparked my curiosity.  Yesterday he almost fit in his dryer.  So0o0o I decided to run my own test.  I tried both ovens (upstairs and downstairs).  Upstairs is A LOT closer to fitting me in, but I was afraid I was gonna break something.  I tried the dryer.  Yeah that's no good either, I'd have to be like sucking on my knee or something.  I tried the washer.  THAT'S A BIG NO.  That just wasn't a smart decision on my part.  So basically I can't fit anywhere in my house.  I can fit in the truck of my car tho!!! :) (I tried that a long time ago).  Yeah so that's about it thus far.  Sorta an interesting day to start off with...and it's not even 11!
