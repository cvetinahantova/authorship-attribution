Ever felt lonely? lifeless? and a strange feeling that everything isnt going on beihnd the scence as you once thought they were? Knowing something is wrong with someone or changed  with someone and you cant quite figure it out?   Yet TRying so hard to.... but still  holding back so you dont lose something  special? Everything going great.. then day by day it gets worse just trying to grip it close and it slipping away like you were nothing but air?? Hope you never do have to feel these immotional turtors..  signing off Sheila
