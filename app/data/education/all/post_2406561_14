Squee. Cesar is awesome. I think I need to steal him away so that we can get married before Nicki objects.  I was so RIGHT. Guy friends are so much better than female friends. Oh how I love thee.  PowderPuffAshley: hey sana, were you one of the people jo told that i was going out with george?  LiLsHoRtCaKe918: YOU ARE?!?!?!?! PowderPuffAshley: EW NO LiLsHoRtCaKe918: haha LiLsHoRtCaKe918: sure LiLsHoRtCaKe918: ;-) PowderPuffAshley: thats nasty :-P  Joyous.   Edit: We did pen pals today in English. Mine was named Clarice. Yeah, she seemed very unenthusatic. Oops. Oh well. I think the funniest pen pal letter had to be Fransico's. Since it was an all-girl school, everyone had female pen pals. On his letter, the poor pathetic girl (note: freshman girl) wrote "ps. you sound hot". Oh how we ripped into that one.   Evilness never ceases to amaze me.
