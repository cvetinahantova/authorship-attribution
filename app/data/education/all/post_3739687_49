hello,  well dinner with niles withers went great.  he is a very nice man with a  great sense of humor.  it was wonderful to hear old names from louisville  that i haven't heard since i was in high school.  also, he seems to be  keeping up with ms news so we talked about the neshoba county fair and eli  manning.  nice to talk about things i'm so familiar with.  anyway... i have  three different parties to go to tonight.  first is a b-day party for a  friend from work, then onto a presentation given by my friend christian with  free food and drinks, and finally a going away party for a french girl who  is a volunteer here.  well gotta run.  wish i could write more but i'm giving summative exams  today and i CANNOT be late.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.
