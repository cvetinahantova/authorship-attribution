Braiiins....   I can't believe how burned out I was today... yesterday... err... 7 hour ago (how's that?). After leaving work (we now got  all 12  of our servers in there, and the printer came in too; we're still missing the switch, and we're probably need to get 3 dedicated power lines), so we can't use all of the servers yet. And they're wickedly noisy to boot) I went to S&T to meet with the other 2 people in my Systems Analysis and Design (SAD) project group. I basically explained the project to them, gave them a little homework ("get on the internet and learn the basics of how rsync works") and we agreed to meet at the lab tomorrow... today... on Friday after SAD and I'll teach them the basics of package management with Debian Linux (which is a breeze,  apt-get  is so cool). But I digress. After the group meeting I went home, did a little detour to Carol and Amber's to pick up what was left of my ice cream (I was surprised that there was any left at all), got home, dropped my backpack, forgot to put the ice cream in the freezer, and crashed the bed. Almost 7 hours later I wake up to find out that Richard and the others were here and finished their Exalted characters. Apparently they let me sleep because Morgan didn't want to mess with my sleeping pattern (see, he can be nice sometimes - although I think that they wouldn't have managed to wake me up even if they wanted to). So what is the lesson of the day? Well, for once it's not good to only get 3 hours of sleep within the last 48 hours.
