urlLink Colleges toughen rules on Net viruses   This article reports that colleges all over the country are having major problems with virus attacks.  Most of our virus troubles at Thomas University have been unnoticed by most of you though we had a couple of days of frantic activity.  Behind the scenes we (mostly Billy) have been working feverishly to stem the tide.  We are being flooded with attempts to infect computers on our network here.  What can you do?  Mostly, it has been done.  You should keep up with the critical Windows updates following the procedure we sent around to everyone last week.  As far as anti virus updates, those are done automatically by our central system for any computer connected to our network.  If you have any questions then, as you usually do, call us.
