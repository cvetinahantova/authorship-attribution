................................ when we were young ................................  erik and i used to sit around strumming our A chords, our G chords and our C chords til there was nothing left of our fingers.  We talked of faith and politics and work and relationships.  marcaus let me drive his vehicle around a roundabout and several other areas of Melbourne.  We talked and laughed and prayed and mugged.  david and i discovered the shock of email together, chatting in computer labs seven hours apart, shocked by what the world used to be and could never be again.  revelling in our rudd-ness, parsing the world with our gigantic intellects.  when i first knew my students, Skylark thought "feminist" was a four letter word, Bemis threw her shoe or her notebook at me (I forget), Mandy listened and cocked her head to the side and seemed both baffled and intrigued.   ....and look, this set of blogs is like a fabric with patches from all of them woven in....  i know such nostalgia, such gee-whiz-aint-that-internet-somethin is neither hip nor  erudite --  but I just wanted to say thanks to all of the aforementioned for stopping into the blog.  I *love* the timbre of your voices in my life...  ~peace
