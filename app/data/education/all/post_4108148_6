In the past several of weeks, my work to play ratio has been extremely one sided and not on the side that I would prefer.  I feel good though, as I am accomplishing a ton that will not only help out myself, but will provide a better opportunity for others as well.  I really do feel proud of what I am able to accomplish.  I also value the challenge in everything.  After that all said, I can't wait until early September rolls around.  I need to make up for lost play time : )  Tomorrow, I am looking forward to seeing my parents.  They will be arriving in the evening and then they will departing on Thursday.  I haven't seen my Father since we went to Wrigley Field to see the Cubs in June, and I haven't seen my Mother since June either, so its been a while.  So far on the agenda is some movie watching and other non walking activities.  I am looking forward to it as it should be a good break.  R and I did the pizza challenge today for lunch.  We each bought a large pizza from dominos with Onions, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Pineapple, Jalapenos, and Hot Banana Peppers.  The objective was to see who could consume more of their pizza with the lofty goal of trying to finish the whole thing.  I consider myself a competitive person, but I have to give it to R.  He ended up beating me by a good slice or two
