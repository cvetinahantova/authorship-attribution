My pace quickened, my heart beat fast, as I raced home to learn my fate of where I was being placed in Japan.  As I approached the house, there was no sign that the mail had come yet.  I flashed a glance towards the neighbor's house but their mailbox revealed no further information.  At our house, none of the 4 mailboxes had the typical magazines or large envelopes protruding from their lips.  I assumed the worst.  The mail had not come yet.  I'd have to wait until the end of the work day to find out.  But as I opened our mailbox, I soon discovered that the "worst" had just gotten worse.  We got our mail but my placement did not arrive yet.  Oh, the agony!  People are posting messages about their placements and I have to wait another day!  I feel like I'm stalking the mail man and every time I see the UPS truck I get anxious!  No placement, no computer, no books, Ah!  Until tomorrow!
