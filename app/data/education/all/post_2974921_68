i haven't talked to jammi in two days now. the other day, we were both online but we didn't talk. then, i found out he was starting to collect lighters, proves that he really is smoking again. i just indulged myself in gooffing off in school trying to get my mind off him. it's just so hard. i miss him so much...too much...
