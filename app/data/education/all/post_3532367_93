I have a department here that has been giving me grief today.     I used to work with them and there are very complicated public sector political links that are too deep to go into here, but basically I have been playing piggy in the middle all day.  They put a call in, I am told by my director to close it and refer them to the supplier, they contact supplier, supplier says they need to speak to someone in IT. Director says close it - supplier can send someone in to cover it under their agreements and the circle continues, with me just being the political pawn.  Interestingly my director said "well you can handle it, your robust." To which I replied with a one liner about being delicate. After we had finished the work discussion he went digging for more info on my one liner, so I admitted to him, very bashfully, that I had been diagnosed with depression and that I was on meds, not sleeping and up for counseling and further referral. I also mentioned my lack of concentration and having to take things one day at a time. He asked what the cause was, and I said I wasn't sure at the moment, but put the trigger down to the difficulties I was experienced at work when I moved department.
