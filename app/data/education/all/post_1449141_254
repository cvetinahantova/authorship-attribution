It lacks an army in the conventional sense. Its leader is almost a ghost figure: a man who lacks a palace, a parliament or a presidency."    This BEFORE we attacked afghanistan  "It is a problem underlined by the CIA last week and local sources on the ground, who both said that the training camps of Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda group were empty of their fighters in anticipation of an American attack. Sources on the ground on the North West Frontier confirmed yesterday that all foreign 'Arabs' had apparently disappeared from their bases in and around Kandahar. Put simply, the enemy has gone."   on the feasibility of militirialization of terrorism  "Still, even the 'Munich Option' has risks. Golda Meir, the Israeli premier at the time, gave the go-ahead to the operation because she wanted to 'cut off the head of the terrorist hydra'. Thirty years later it has more heads than ever.   Welcome to a long and dirty war."
