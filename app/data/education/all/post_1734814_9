Having recently discovered that there is an "am" time period between 3am and 11am i've decided it can hapen to other people. Work may wish to interfere with this agenda, but i claim zombiehood before 11 on any given day and so therefore am not really in existence anyway.  Caught up wit an old friend from beach mission last night. Found out about another mates 18th about an hour aftre it started, decided to go anyway. Was told i probably wouldn't know too many people there. Found i knew two thirds and proceeded to meet the rest. Card tricks and stuff always seem to break the ice with people. Anyway, the friend i mentioned is doing her HSC over three years in order to focus on her prime love in life: dancing. That's fine, except that she teaches dancing, as well as doing it as a HSC subject. She teaches it at the school she takes the subject at. So she is now teaching the dance subject she is taking for the HSC, at the school she is taking it. Bizarre.
