I felt really left out, reading all of these so called 'blogs' of all of my friends. So, here I am...posting this thing, hoping that one of you will comment on my creativity, or something.Â  So, I am moving away from home in about a week, or so, and I am kind of scared. Any of my friends have any helpful, loving advice for their late blooming friend? By saying late blooming, I mean, I am the last one to do everything in our little group. Anyway, I will be fine, I am just a little skeered. That's all.
