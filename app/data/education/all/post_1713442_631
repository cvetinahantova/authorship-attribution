urlLink Helping Students with Disabilities Succeed in State and District Writing Assessments. ERIC/OSEP Digest. : This ERIC Digest is by Cynthia Warger.   From the ERIC Digest:   While writing poses significant challenges for many students with disabilities, good teaching can help them overcome these barriers. The writing of students with disabilities typically contains more mechanical errors than that of their nondisabled peers and is less polished, expansive, coherent, and effective. Difficulties may exist because students with disabilities tend to:   * Know less than their peers about the characteristics of good writing.   * Begin writing with little or no planning.   * Limit revisions to minor corrections.   * Have problems with transcription processes (e.g., spelling, handwriting, punctuation).   To help students with disabilities perform at their best on writing assessments, teachers can use the following techniques:   * Use the three principles of effective writing instruction.   * Prepare students to participate in writing assessments.   * Use assistive technology in instruction and testing.   * Provide students with appropriate accommodations during testing and ensure that the accommodations correspond to those used during instruction.
