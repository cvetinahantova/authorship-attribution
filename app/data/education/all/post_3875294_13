O.k. so my freind Alicia got me started on this.  Like her I'm not much of a journaler.  In fact I really hate it.  Maybe this will help, or maybe I will never write on hear agian.  I plan to though.  Well, I can't write much now.  John's hungry, so I better go.  I think we are grabbing subway.  Got one of those stamp cards, so we get a free san.  Our 1st anniversay is soon, this coming Monday.  Can't wait.  We are going to the coast and staying at a really neat place.
