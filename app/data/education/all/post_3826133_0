Perhaps this will keep me entertained at work some. The question now, do I send this address out to other people, or just wait for them to find it? I think I'll just wait. After all, I'm really doing this for my own amusement.   Sam (the BF) is out of town right now. I miss him something irksome. I really wish he was here for the holiday weekend. He'll be out of town with his roommate Kevin. I think they went to the PK to sit on the lake or something. I don't really remember where he told me they were going. He's called a couple of times, and I guess I could ask him, but I don't really care outside of the fact that it's *not here.* Phooey. It sucks to be this lonely without him.   I've decided to activly search for another job. As long as it's at the hospital. I only want to work for UMC, which I suppose is sad and pathetic, but I just love them so much. They're good to me.   Lia is going with my ex-husband's parents this weekend. That's going to make the house that much emptier.   Holidays are not fun for me.   Although, I think Seester Sekatsim is in town already. Perhaps she'd like to entertain me...I'm dying to see her. Its been years. Literally!
