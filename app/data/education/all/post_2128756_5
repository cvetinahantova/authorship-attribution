My parents are out of town(England actually)so, it's just me and the gerbils. I am beginning to make a worrisome discovery: I don't do well on my own. All those negative traits I have are just seeping out, because, well, there's no one here to see them. It's just so quiet here that I can hear myself think. So quiet that I start to tiptoe around just to avoid making noise. And I really wish someone were here. Someone besides me. I think I might be lonely, which I knew, but now that I'm actually on my own it comes into focus so much more. And I don't particularly like it.
