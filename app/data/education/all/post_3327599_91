i didn't mean you were boring Sheila.. i just meant the day as a whole was bad lol. and it said you coming over was the high light of the day thus far. so ha! what now..  so last night i went over to Phil's to hang out. yeah so guess who was there too.. you'll never guess.. Chris Elliot.. isn't that crazy? and apparently he doesn't like me too much lol. oh well i honestly don't remember ever being mean to him except teasing him about Emy.. speaking of Emy what ever happened to her? she just kinda stopped hanging out with us one day.. she ditched us for that ugly chick.. what's her name? i don't know.. is she still dating that Elijah Wood lookin' kid? i don't know his name either.. anywho! Phil and i went to see Sheila last night. that just ended with eye shadow lines down my arm and adidas adrenaline on my hand and a coupon for.. something.
