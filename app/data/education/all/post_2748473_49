I finally got my medicine ish sorted out and I am feeling quite well and hopefully it will stay that way. I have only 2 more days left of school and am looking forward to working at my job this summer. Probably skate for a lot of the summer and chill with some homies. I hope to go see Katie at least more than once this summer up at camp, which is likely because I can just hit up rides from Annen, Preston or my parents. I don't have the internet for a while so I will probably post few and far between this summer. Much love for you all!!!!!
