..................................  comments? readers?  ..................................  my brother  urlLink david , former pirate, later a cubicle crime lord, now a curiously not-substituting-any-identity-real-live-blogger turned me on to  urlLink     who offers shareware for adding comments to your site.   so my page is finally a little more democratic.  we have room for minority reports.  please feel free to go back and rant about ... whatever you've been disagreeing with me for a long time about...  or not...  ~peace
