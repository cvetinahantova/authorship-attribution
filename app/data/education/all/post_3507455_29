I got a new job! I'm going to sell insurance. That may not sound like much, indeed it's not the thrill a minute lifestyle I'm used to working with bad kids and all, but it's a good job that will pay well if I apply myself. The funny thing is that I will go broke before my job starts. I have to shell out about $300 to get licensed to sell insurance. And the job that I am doing is not paying me until the end of September I recently found out. So that sucks. Yet another reason why insurance will be good for me.  Since I probably won't start the insurance job until the end of september, I need money now to pay these bills and so I can eat. So anyone have any odd jobs in the meantime? Very short term. I will clean your house! I will perk up your slacking young marriage if your wife is a looker. Will improv for dinner and $20! I also love charity. I ma not afraid of it.  Excited in a happy way and a nervous way, Mike the Tall
