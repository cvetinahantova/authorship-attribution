Every summer, PETA--the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals--picks two vegetarians and names them the sexiest of all the people on Earth who don't eat meat. Andre 3000 and Alicia Silverstone were chosen this year from more than 180 celebrities after some 12,000 votes were cast.  The 2004 winners narrowly edged out a host of other veggie Valentinos and Venuses, including Noah Wyle, Pamela Anderson, Charlotte Ross, Kim Basinger, Moby, and previous winners Tobey Maguire, Josh Hartnett, Lauren Bush, Natalie Portman, and Shania Twain.    There's nothing wrong with being a vegetarian.  But I can't deny that it's surprising when you hear about people being one.  I don't know.  I just thing it's silly to say humans can't eat meat because of animal rights.  I agree with the part about not wearing animal fur though (especially when the heads are still attached).
