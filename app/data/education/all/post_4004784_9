Hey folks!  Wow...this is neat; I've never visited a blog before.  What does "blog" stand for, anyway?  ...It sounds like something Shrek would excrete after dinner!  :-)  j/k  I hope everyone is enjoying a fine week.  Work at the Cross has been busy...we're finishing up the writing, editing, etc. for the upcoming "Report of Giving" (which is published every Fall).  Next week, I'll be attending a Development conference at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH -- that should be cool!  I'm absolutely amazed at how bustling the HC campus is...I thought it'd be a "ghost town" after the students left for the summer -- certainly NOT the case.  There's been tons of camps the past few weeks...basketball, football, lacrosse, field hockey, cheerleading...and even an academic camp for Woo-ville middle schoolers (which my colleagues have dubbed "nerd camp!").  Needless to say, Mt. Saint James has become "the place" to be this summertime!    Oh, one more thing:  Tomorrow, I should have my pictures developed from last weekend's mini-Reunion.  I can't wait (...I HOPE the picture of the Shea Stadium jumbo-tron comes out!).  Yee-Haw!   Have a great rest of the week!  --Caddie :-)
