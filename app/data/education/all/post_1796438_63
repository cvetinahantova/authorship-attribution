I am ashamed of you Hayden! You of all people should know what it's liked to be picked on. Since when did you become the "Oh so mighty" and know what everyone thinks! "We"? "We" is a term used to summarise EVERYONE and EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN OPINION!  I think the punch wasn't deserved! What f***ing right do you have to do that to a person! I'm so f***ing p***ed at you Hayden! You've stooped down to a level that I thought you'd never go to!  You're not a popular person Hayden, f***, not even I'm a popular person in "the group" (yes, still claim you guys as mine but only just) but nobody f*** punched me. Sure I was called names and sh*t but nobody deserves that.   You are a pompous prick!  I hate to say it but you are. It's not just you, it's all the guys in "the group". Just just build a f***ing bridge and get over it! Grow up! Get a life! Learn what is it to have fun AWAY from a computer.  I'm going to get negative replies to this but I don't care. Each person is entitled to their own opinion and this is mine.  I say this on behalf of me. Nobody else. If you get angry, it is at me but you do not offend, hit or threaten ANY of my friends or you'll be asking for it...not because you hit him (which is f***ing wrong!) but you pushed the wrong buttons so prepare to get pushed back.  (P.S: Wow! I must be mad! Look how many f*** words there are...)
