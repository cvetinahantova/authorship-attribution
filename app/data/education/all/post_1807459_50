I don't have much to say but I'll  blog b/c nobody else seems to want to, except for Caleb.  I should be playing some video games with Fenton later tonight.  That should be fun.  I need to lay off of the alcohol related activities until tomorrow.  I'll revise and finalize the rules for the "make out pact."  First, whoever you make out with can't be in the friend group.  Further more it can't be someone you've already made out with.  Everyone else will be the judge of attractive.  But in general it is up to you (the participant) to use common sense.  Also we are functioning on the honor system so please be honest.    What is up with the weather?  Isn't it winter?  I guess I shouldn't be complaining but man last year it was frigid.  I think I could walk around in t-shirt today.  I think my short term compute goal will be to find a quiz nobody has taken yet.  Will Asma really have soju punch tomorrow?  I hope so.  That stuff is a little bit awesome.  As bad as soju tastes it mixes so well with so many things.   Georgia Tech is still unbeaten and now ranked #3.  That is basketball of course.  Football on the other hand stinks and will play in the Humanitarian Bowl.  What kind of crap is that?  There are way to many bowl games nowadays.  Off to teach the kids.
