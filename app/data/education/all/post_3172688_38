Hey... Today just started and it's already ended up bad. I can't do anything in this house without getting yelled at.  Last night mom started this by yelling at me for playing my music. I don't understand why she just can't eave me be. I don't understand why a  lot  of people can't just leave me alone. I'm tired of the fact that I can't care about anything without getting yelled at because everyone else has different opinions then me.  It sucks to be born and raised in a house where you can't be yourself. I can't tell my parents anything because they don't approve. I just keep it all bottled up inside, waiting to burst... Wanting to burst... But I can't do that either, because everyone will end up mad right back at me. Can you imagine a lifestyle to where you feel like a robot because you don't,  can't , have a opinion, and when you do, your just this little person so no one will listen anyways.  I don't see why people have to be treated this way. All caged up and never really gets to explore or go out. I can't stand living here just because people really don't give a crap about me and when they do,  wow , what a way they show it! I can't even remember the last time my parents told me that they loved me... How sad is that? Once again, everyone has gotten the better of me. I mean, here I am swimming in my own tears just because I care about other people caring about me. God, I'm so confused... All I want is to be left alone. I think I'm going to go for a walk in a bit. I don't think I will last much longer if I stay in this  box . No, I'm going to go  now ... I'm not going to take my paper, if I think of anything worthwhile, and then I will remember enough to write down later... bye.
