I have many memories of my best friend's father. He would sit and listen to stories that Karen and I would tell him even if they lasted hours. I will miss his delicious salads he would make for us on the weekends. I miss his smile...it was the greatest! He was one of the most well loved people that I will ever know. He always treated me like one of his own daughters in his home. I am very lucky to have known George and he will be truly missed by his friends and family.  Patsy
