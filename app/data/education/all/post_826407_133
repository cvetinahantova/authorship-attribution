"See! The winter is past;  the rains are over and gone.  Flowers appear on the earth;  the season of singing has come,  the cooing of doves  is heard in our land.  The fig tree forms its early fruit;  the blossoming vines spread their fragrance.  Arise, come, my darling;  my beautiful one, come with me."   Song of Solomon 2: 11-13  I am loving the promise of summer that is in the air right now.  Winter ending, spring coming, Lent draws towards Easter and with it comes the promise of new life, of resurrection.
