The  BBC  is reporting that French politicians received bribes from Saddam Hussein.  One of those accused responded by saying:   "I have never received any gifts from the Iraqi government  and I am not in the habit of making my decisions on the basis of any remuneration I might receive."   In other words, I didn't get a bribe, and if I did, it wouldn't have influenced me, at least most of the time.
