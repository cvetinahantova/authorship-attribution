Have you ever loved so much that you were willing to let go?  It finally happened to me. I found perfect love and even though I wanted to be selfish and hold on I had to set it free.  This person is so pure and so full of light that it is addictive and if I didn't do it now  I am not sure I ever could.  Unfortunately a past mistake  caught up with me and paying the price with no hope of wiping that slate clean. They say that if you love something you first must let it go and if it doesn't return then it wasn't meant to be. What a difficult thing to do. In such a non-stop, "me" society, are we ever going to find that special someone? I think the most frustrating part is I know that this was the real deal, what I have spent years looking for, but it's just too late. I hope that we both find the kind of happiness I feel when we are in each other's arms. There will always be a place left open and a glimmer of hope that the two of us can overcome the shadows. Am I the last  hopeful  romantic?
