Dedicated to: SMR, PD, AS and AJF   Sometimes it's hard to find a friendly face Among the bustling crowd or to understand a new look given by a passerby. The hurt of uncertainty of the wave from afar transforms itself into  a hope that comes too late.  I try to listen to the footsteps walking on the wet pavement but the light from sundown blocks my understanding of the lightening that struck you and the colours of sunrise hinder my perception of the coolness of your skin.  Little by little I reach the end of another day that went by; It was a face I didn't see A warmth I never felt It was the hurt of the uncertainty of a day that was never lived.
