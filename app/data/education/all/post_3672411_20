I'm here. It was an exhausting trip but I'm here. My colleagues had a little party for me and the other dude who arrived today. I forced myself to stay up until 11:00 PM (Japan time) and got up at 8:00 AM..I think I'm back on track.  Sister's flaky friend now wants me to courier her stuff to her because she can't be bothered to pick it up. "I'll pay you back".  God.
