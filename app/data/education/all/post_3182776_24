Tonight on  Later With Jools Holland , the poet Roger McGough said:  The best thing about being famous is, Walking down the street, And people turning around to look at you, And bumping into things.  Fucking genius.    I've spent the better part of the day holed up in a wee corner of Asskiss Towers, churning out the trickiest half of my essay on assessment. It's a matter of great frustration to me that I can't seem to write an essay in a couple of hours like other people. Most students I know can quite literally just sit down and type the things. They squeeze it, toothpaste-like out of their brains and onto the page. With me it's an exercise in slow and painful construction. Paragraphs and sentences get slotted together and swung into place like weighty girders. Only when the whole thing is halfway built can I start to see how wrong it is, and exactly how it should be torn down and replaced from the ground up. Matters today weren't helped by a coven of squawking Institute of Education harpies who had selected the Trainee's Workroom as a venue for gossip exchange. They described their social lives to eachother and therefore also me in painfully explicit detail all day long. My jaw still aches from long hours of grinding my teeth while trying to resist the temptation to bludgeon them to death with  Educating Artistic Vision  by Elliot Eisner. Cows.   Today's hero of the day is Andrew Strauss, for making 112 runs on debut, the first person to score a century in his first Test match for England since Graham Thorpe in 1993. Nobody reading will give two hoots about this, but cricket is a thing very close to my heart, and this made me absurdly happy for a bit this afternoon.  Today's Obtuse Twat of the day is Morrissey, for being lyrically unsurpassable but socially intolerable. If I saw this guy I wouldn't know whether to shake his hand or punch his lights out. What an arsehole.  The weekend beckons. Fuck the weekend, I'm going to bed.
