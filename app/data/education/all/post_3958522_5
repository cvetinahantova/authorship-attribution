One thing that is becoming more and more apparent is that people will choose their house church based upon the day of the week it is meeting.  We simply can't accomodate the schedules of everyone we're connected with.  Matt and Lou's house church is much smaller than they first thought because of that very fact.  They just couldn't satisfy everyone's availability.  There's nothing wrong with that, in fact it excites me.  Why?  Because its something beyond your control as parents.  It is totally dependant on the providence of God.  Yes, God may be sending you  specific people arbitrarily based upon what nights they're off of work.  Let's sit back and let the Kingdom unfold as it will.  Currently, we have one house church meeting on Tuesday nights and two meeting on Wednesday nights.  You Wednesday folks: is there any way one of you may be able to meet on Thursday nights instead?  It's just a suggestion.  This would put each of you in a unique position to receive a unique group of people.  It makes sense for our first three house churches.  For any house churches that may multiply out of you, it really wouldn't matter what night they would meet.  I'm just trying trying to load the bases during this first wave!   In Vegas the most popular night for house church meetings was Friday night, believe it or not.  I suppose it makes sense since on Friday nights we enjoy spending time with our friends.    Keep in mind that all other House Churches are going to likely develop out of you three!  Therefore, if you would feel comfortable, would you guys mind us advertising your House Church meeting times?  There are dozens of people in Columbia waiting to get invited to one.  What do you think would be the best way to go about that?  Oh yeah, what are your house church names?  I think the simplest thing to do is name them after your location.  I believe Matt and Lou's is The Church @ 719 Henderson.  It's simple, to the point and uninstitutionalized.
