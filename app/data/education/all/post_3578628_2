References to God were ordered to be put back into oaths by a judge of the state Supreme Court.  Apparently, one judge took it upon himself to change courtroom procedure by taking God out.  If the judges fail to follow through with the court's request, they may be held in contempt of court.  In a quote, "Basically the judge swore in his own witnesses,"  ...  "I think this decision returns this court to the people instead of like a dictatorship of one judge."  He's got a point.  Good to have God back in our oaths.
