Have you ever had a week where you were soooooo busy that you couldn't complete a task because every time you sat down to do something, you'd think of something else you had to do?  That's this week for me.  I drive myself crazy when I'm like this.  Usually I'm very organized.  I make a list and do things in order and then check things off.  Not so lately...  The end is in sight.  Friday I will complete my report card (and can stop trying to think up nice ways of saying "Your kid would rather talk and screw around than do any work so his grades suck!") and I will, hopefully, stop being so ADD.
