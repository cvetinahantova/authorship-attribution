Not much time to write since I'm on break between classes.  Quick hello goes out to Jessica.  I'll write more about you when I have time.  I'm up in Chil-gok today and it isn't too bad.  My first time in this part of town and it's pretty cool.  I think we'll have dinner again at WABA tonight.  I'm begining to like this tradition.  Living downtown is awesome.  I love living in the dorm.  The room isn't great or anything but it's the fact I'm so close to downtown.  The sliding doors leading to my blachony are kinda fucked and the floor is dirty but I'm loving the extra channels and lack of airplanes flying around at the ass crack of dawn.  Yesterday was fun.  I went to Festival after work with some LIKE people.  Pretty cool place.  Gyeh-son, Tim and crew showed up later on and we went to AU and then to Bubble for like a second.  At least I did.  I was out later then I expected.  There is come kind of party on the roof tonight.  I'm not sure if I'll attend.  I might show up to see whose there but Mark is one of the hosts and while I don't there is bad blood between us I wouldn't consider us friends.   I had Thursday off and didn't do much.  I had a great nights sleep and then bumbed around downtown.  I saw "50 first dates" and it pretty much sucked hard.  Before the movie Asma was nice enough to call me and we talked for awhile.  I had to give her the updates on everyone and how they are.  I wanted to see a baseball game but of course there wasn't one.   Ok Saturday night here I come.
