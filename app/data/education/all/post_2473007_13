"It took the wise men longer to find through wisdom what the shephers found through revelation."     -Keith Gardner    They were willing to give time, effort and reputation to seek the Savior-child, and they were not satisfied until the found Him.  They knew who to worship and they brought Him gifts that cost them something.  If you want to love Him more, give Him that which you value...   Being a wise man means more that pointing at a star in the sky... It means more than standing and watching the Savior... It means giving expensive gifts... It means traveleing across great distances... It means RISKING YOUR LIFE to worship the Messiah...
