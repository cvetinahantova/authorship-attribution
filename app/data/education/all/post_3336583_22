Check out my parents new dog,  urlLink Monty . He is a (almost) 2 year old Greyhound my parents rescued from the track. He is so cute and has a great personality!  Last week Pam, Brandon, and I took Cora on her first official outing. We went to see the  urlLink Chihuly in the Garden  exhibit at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. The glass pieces were unbelievable!  I hope you enjoy the pictures.  urlLink
