Spent the weekend with Helen and the Tribal Trainees (Formees?) on their retreat/party weekend.  The first part was silent retreat so I spent the afternoon sitting on a tree stump in the middle of Norfolk in the sun; beautiful.  I got well in to the retreat thing. After a week at school the day of silence was like a long cool drink.  Saturday Evening we found ourselves in the local pub for Kareoke.  I say pub but it felt a bit more like a youth club with beer ( due to the locals, not anyone we took along).  Great musical turns by Nick and Martin though, nice work guys.
