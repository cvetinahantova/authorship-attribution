CD's... 
 
 Here's a list of CD's I play endlessly! They're not in any particular order
either. Looking at it, it's funny that I've got so many 'Best Of' ones,
but that's a good place to start. I'd love some more early Stones, The
Who, plus XTC - and The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds'! Am I an old geeser?
You betya - and proud of it! pmsl! There's many a day or night when I'm
sitting at this damn desk typing away, with one of these oozing out of
my CD player here... either thru the air, or thru some groovy (lol)
headphones - I don't wanna keep my flatmate awake forever listening to
all my 'classical music'! lol 
Even as I'm writing this, I'm listening to Bob Dylan's 'Blonde on
Blonde' - for like the umteen-millionth time. I can never get weary of
the sound of this thing!
