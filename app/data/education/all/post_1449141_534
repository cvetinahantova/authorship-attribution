HELEN GINSBERG, njfac@njfac.org,http://www.njfac.org Co-director of publications for the National Jobs for All Coalition and professor emeritus of economics at Brooklyn College, Ginsberg said today: "The number of people who were counted as unemployed in January is 8.3 million, but there are 4.7 million people working part-time even though they wanted full-time jobs and couldn't get them and another 4.7 million people who currently want a job but are not counted as unemployed because they weren't looking for a job in the prior four reference weeks. Further, we estimate that roughly one in four women and one in seven men who had full-time jobs the year round earned less than the poverty level for a family of four."
