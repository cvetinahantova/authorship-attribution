Ok well it seems like the blog is finally working now.  I don't have much to say but I have time to kill here so I'll just type away.  I'll start off with the mildly amusing stories of my crazy students who always talk about sex.  Today he let me know that he doesn't want women to give him oral sex b/c he is afraid that they might bite it off.  Smart kid.  He also talked about how big Becky's boobs are.  I guess Becky has taught that class before.   My plan is go get some decent sleep tonight and head to Suwon tomorrow and then from there to head into Seoul.  I'm not sure if there is a serial killer running around Seoul anymore.  I asked one of my teachers today if there was.  She said she wasn't sure but that there were many people in Seoul.  Well duh, I knew that.  I gotta pack.  I think I'll only bring one change of clothes.  I just plan to get up and pretty much go home on Sunday so there is no need to look pretty. I've got to go home and pack.  I wanted to do some laundry but there just isn't any time.  I think I'll just read myself to sleep.  I'm actually looking forward to the bus ride so I can have around 3 hrs to just sit around and read my book and study.  Geez I'm a nerd.  Too bed with me.
