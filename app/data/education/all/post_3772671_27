Walla Walla has been undergoing a dining revolution in the last several years. The most recent entry in the entree business is  urlLink 26 brix , which we visited the other day with friends from Spokane.   It's in the Dacres Hotel, a classic old building in Walla Walla that used to be a brothel at one point in its history. Everything's remodeled beautifully, including the men's room, which has enormous old urinals that are practically as big as stalls and a very modern sink that consists of a flat blue slab that catches the water as it flows.  The hostess was a little distant, giving the place a bit of attitude. The waiters were extremely attentive, almost overly anxious to please. They kept asking if I liked things, and I almost felt bad when I couldn't rave. It probably had to do with the fact that a lot of them were Whitman students and knew me from that context. The menu was the kind of menu requiring a lot of explanation, which the waiters provided. They also gave tips on how to eat the food (i.e., "try to include all five flavors of the dessert in each mouthful").  So how was the food? I had a lobster bisque that had a very strong taste, almost burnt, but in a good, intentional way, perhaps a bit too salty. I have to say I really enjoyed it. That was followed by "day boat scallops" (meaning that they were fresh that day, according to the staff), on a bed of vegetables, with black truffles. Very tasty.  Dessert was a delight. I had a strawberry tart that was light and tasty. Others had a "chocolate tour" (probably the most decadent) and watermelon soup (probably the most pleasant surprise).   It's at the high end of Walla Walla dining, with entrees in the $30 + range. With the soup, dessert, drinks and coffee, it was an expensive meal.  The bar, by the way, looks very hip.
