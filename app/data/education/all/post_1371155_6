...that is the rather appropriate blurb for rather extraordinary debut novel- Star by Pamela Anderson. From  urlLink all accounts  it seems like a semi-pornographic story about an aspiring starlet called Star Wood Leigh who wears skimpy t-shirts with messages such as "Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw" and aspires to make it big in Hollywood. Ms Anderson admits that the story is  urlLink partly autobiographical  and that the name of the protagonist is the name she would have adopted had she been a porn star, and then provides this fascinating insight: "Somebody told me once that you figure out your porn name by taking the name of the first pet you ever owned and combining it with the name of the first street you ever lived on."  Despite the rather thin storyline, the debut novel has quite obviously generated  urlLink some media interest  (perhaps because it features her topless on the cover and contains a fold out nude photo of herself)  and the Independent even  urlLink admits  that as far as trash goes, it's not all that bad, and she herself is quite pleased that she need not  urlLink take her top off  to get people to say that it's not all crap.
