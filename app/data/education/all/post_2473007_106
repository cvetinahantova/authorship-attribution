Jessica and I went with about fifteen other people from Grace Bible Fellowship in Redhook, NY to evangelize to a migrant camp of about fifty Spanish workers at a nearby farm.  Before hand we prayed for our trip and were a trifle apprehensive because no one had a solid plan.  The idea was simply to walk around, share the gospel (as best as we could) and let the Spirit lead.  I had brought my guitar, so I sat in the dining room (which consisted of four picnic tables in a concrete block room with a drain in the floor) and played the few Spanish songs I knew and then some from a sheet Pastor Cirone had given me.   It turned out to be one of the best nights I've had in a while.  I met Caesar - a 17 year old boy whose father and mother were associate pastors at a church in Texas.  He really didn't want anything to do with God or the Bible, and I assume that's because he feels like its been crammed down his throat all his life.  I just but the decision in his hands and let God work away.   We're hoping to go again this coming Friday - I'll fill you in on how things go!
