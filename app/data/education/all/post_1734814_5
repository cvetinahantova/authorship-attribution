Tried typing an e-mail to a friend this morning. No problems there, except it was one of those lengthy dissertations you get when you just satrt typing and continue to type. No worries, this happens a lot. Then, just as i was finished, i bumper the "back" button of my mouse (i have one of those intellimice things). Of course, this means that when i went back to my e-mail, it remembered the address and the subject, and my several hundred word mini thesis into the meaing of life was lost to posterity forever. or at least until i can get enough coffee into me to work up the efoort to retype it all. Funny isn't it, it's harder to type the second time over. It feels like work, rather than typing a letter. Annoying.  Which is probably why i can come straight over here and type without thinking about it, yet am baulking at the thought of typing the mail over again. bizarre.
