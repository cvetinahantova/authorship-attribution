And that is all there is to say about my days of packing. Finished. Hooray.  Now, all I need to do is crawl onto the couch and watch some TV before hitting the sack with Monty. Monty would be my stuffed moose, ya'll.  How many people can say they have a ginormous stuffed moose from Colorado? Hmmm...if there are a lot of you, then I suddenly feel in good company. If there aren't, then I feel like an individual.  Note to self--do not forget your Gamecube when you leave tomorrow. Bad idea.  G'night all. I'm outta here....
