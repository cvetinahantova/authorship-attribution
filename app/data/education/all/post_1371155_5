Yesterday Putu sat in Calcutta, feeling incredibly whole, and watched Charlies Angels 2: Full Throttle. A part of Putu felt like Putu had seen the movie before, but for another part, it was as if it were the first time.   Charlies Angels 2, Putu insists, is one of the great movies of all time. True, the script and plot leave something to be desired, but for non-stop, all-fetish-encompassing, multi-coloured in-your-face high-octane double-barrelled explosive entertainment, there can be nothing else. So much beauty, crammed together on just one screen....brilliant.
