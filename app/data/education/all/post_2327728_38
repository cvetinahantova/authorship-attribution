I am going to Toronto for a few days, and I am so excited about it.  I am staying with some friends I met while living in Taiwan - Martha and Chris.  They were both a bit older than me, and I felt like they were my big sister & brother.  It was nice that they were so protective of me.    Of course, it wasn't all about protecting me - it was also about taking care of me while we were partying.  Chris and Martha were much more experienced with the international party scene, and were good about taking care of me when we went out to clubs or parties.  I was naive, but Martha was always making sure I got home safe, or would pull me away if she knew I was talking to trouble, and with them I had some of the best times of my life.  There was this one party in Kaohsiung at a foreigner's house for Halloween... that was a really good time.  We should have all been deported for what went on.  *Sigh*  Good times... and more to come by week's end.
