Well, school starts tomorrow. I am excited and a little nervous. I think I have everything ready, but what if I forgot something essential? There's nothing I can do about it if I did, but it is still a source of frustration and anxiety. It's like the old "did I leave the oven on?" bit.  I did sneak in a little  Star Wars Galaxies  today. I don't know why though. That game gets more and more boring every time I get on there.I guess it's a decent time waster though.  Oh, I finally had a chance to watch  Reservoir Dogs  last night. Wow, it was so Shakespearean! Sharp dialogue, witty repartee, plenty of blood and gore. I was even thinking it would make a great play. Just use the warehouse scenes and amplify them with some more dialogue explaining what occured after the jewelry heist.  I have to go back to class next Saturday and I am not looking forward to it. I haven't quite finished my homework yet, and with school in full swing I will have a difficult time focusing on it. Teaches me right for procastinating, I guess.
