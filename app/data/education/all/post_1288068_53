Once again you find me in bed. How slovenly. I'm not sure what to tell you today. What did I  used  to talk about? I can't remember. Anyway.  Some of you want to know How it All Ended:  We turned up on Thursday to have our files checked and to hand them in for final assessment. Of course, this sounds far simpler than it actually was  -  upon inspection, everyone had things missing which then had to be done at the last minute amidst much stressing and shouting and stropping around. I am ashamed to include myself in that bit.  I think we ended up running about like crazies for about six hours before the hand-in time came round. Then we each checked in our files with Barbara, who gave us a pink slip of paper with our names on. And that was it. Those of us who had finished went to the pub, but we left lots of other comrades behind, typing and photocopying like billy-o  in order to meet the final deadline of 8pm.  I hugged Carla. She was fragrant and huggable. I'm glad we will be seeing her again soon, it wasn't a great way to finish.  Yesterday I paid my fine of Â£16.40 (!) at the library and Lucy gave me a lift home with all my exhibition stuff. Thanks Lucy! She also invented an amazing new drink from the paltry contents of our fridge.  At night, I took Chris to see Shrek 2 at the Empire in Leicester Square. It was great.  I can do whatever I want today! It is too exciting.   Why not indulge me by considering a few PGCE thoughts for one last time:   We still don't know who has passed and who has failed (if anyone) ... angst!  I am an actual, real life teacher.  Carla's bracelets  -  are they the source of her power?  Would we do it again?  Probably.
