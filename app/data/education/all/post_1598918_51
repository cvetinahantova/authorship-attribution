Pendrives – Now available at TU Store!   Can you imagine fitting the data from 24 floppy disks onto a device no bigger than a pack of gum? Consider the pint-sized USB drives. Known by many names – jump drives, pen drives, flash drives, memory drives; they can plug directly into a USB port on your computer so that you can transfer data between systems, take work home from the office, or use as temporary storage. All USB drives are compatible with Macs and Windows 98/ME/2000/XP systems that have USB ports. They are “plug and play” for Macs and Windows ME/2000/XP systems; Windows 98 systems may have to install some drivers before the system can recognize the drive. These drives do not require any additional power source since they draw their power from the USB connection. Once the drive is plugged in, the system will automatically detect it as a removable drive. Using Explorer or Finder, you can copy or move files to the USB drive from the hard drive, or modify or delete any files currently on the USB drive. Some USB drives even have an LED that blinks as data is being copied to it.  USB drives are made by a number of manufacturers. Names like Sandisk, BUSlink, and LEXAR are some of the ones you can find on the market. A few of the drives also have advanced features like the ability to password-protect files, divide the drive into different security zones, or write-protect the drive from accidental file deletion. USB drives range in capacity from 16 megs to 2 gigs with prices between $15 to $350, depending on capacity, features, and manufacturer. Like other storage devices, these drives do have a limited life span – estimated MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) is 300,000 hours.
