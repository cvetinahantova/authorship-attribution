So, I picked up the take-home exam for ECE 750 this morning. It's not very difficult, but it does take a lot of time, and I'm unusually tired today. So I decided to go home for a nap, and sleep over the problems. That's how I usually get my best inspirations, and today is no exception. The first question relates to reflective dimensions. As an example we are given the classic reification, with introspection on one end and intercession on the other. So my first thought was to look in the documents for other types of reflections, such as behavioral reflection and structural reflection. But when I woke up from my nap I had a new idea: reflection covers  what one does  with the meta information. One can just look at it and act upon it (introspection), but one can also modify it (intercession). But the papers also cover other things:  What  gets reified,  when  something gets reified,  how  it gets reified...  I am sure that both methods will yield a satisfying answer, so I'm not worried about which to use. But considering the distribution of topics in the documents, I think the latter is more homogeneous to the topics.  It suddenly got dark outside - looks like a thunderstorm is approaching. So there goes my intention of walking back to the office to continue working on the exam. Not that either way is that much better - sure, walking will get me the extra exercise I could need, but with the car I can make a stop by Sobey's and get some caffeinated sugary goodness for an all-night writing frenzy. Too bad that caffeinated Mountain Dew is not allowed here. Anyway, off I am on my road to academic glory.
