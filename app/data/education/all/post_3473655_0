Today is our last full day of school.  Us teachers are just as anxious as the students to get this next week over with.  I still have to make my exams, though... Last night I had to meet with my sponsor (I am an alcoholic thankyouverymuch) and had a very good meeting after it.  As I was driving home, I couldn't help but think of my ex and how he is drinking, constantly, it seems.  He hangs out at Hooters (yes, he is white trash!), biker bars, and rents videos from porno shops.  His problems are deepening.  I am so glad I am now on the outside, not a part of it.  When I think to the sick last months we were together, and the strange stuff he was doing, I realize now that the majority of things going wrong were him.  I hadn't been kissed for weeks.  Sex was something that came about after weird stuff happened....drugs, porn videos, whatever.  After three years together, things are supposed to get better.  Comfortable.  Sane.  But it just got more and more insane, and I am glad he flipped out that last day and I'm glad he moved out.  I am happy to be single.  I am LOVING it!  I have done so many good things for myself these past two weeks.  I feel great getting up in the morning.  I am busy.  There are lonely times, but then again, I had worse lonely times when he was there.
