All of these are lofty ideas.  I would like to think that I am these things and at times I am but I often fall short of the 100% mark.  As I enjoyed living in America and celebrating all she gives me so openly I reflected on some of these ideas. My inspiration came from a great documentary I saw over the holiday weekend, (no, it wasn't Fahrenheit 911) Control Room.  I am not going to write a review about this movie so look it up if you don't know what it is about. Patriotism is not an American idea but all too often we as Americans think that everyone else wants to be us and that no one else is proud of their country. It took a proud Arab man to bring this idea home. Here is a man who believes in American Democracy (the ideal, not the reality that falls so short) and yet he loves his country and cares so much for its people that he is willing to speak out against not only a former Iraqi dictator but also against the US.  Both parties are guilty of not caring about the people of Iraq. It took this man in a far off place to ring home my faith in what democracy can do.  I believe in media objectivity but realize that it is an ideal that never happens.  I am optimistic that I will find love,that I won't get sick,that my tigers will win 10 games this season but more importantly I am optimistic that the American people can stop this war of personal gain and senseless killing.  I know that with new leadership that there will be world order again and the UN can do their job with out being bullied by the US.
