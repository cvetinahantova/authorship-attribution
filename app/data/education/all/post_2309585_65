Your soul is OPTIMISTIC. You tent to look to the brighter side of things, and your positive outlook on life makes others happy. People love your open, unassuming nature and your innocent belief in good  for you, the grass on your side of the fence is always greener. You are rarely, if ever, pessimistic or doubtful, and you try your hardest to make life the best it can be, for yourself and others. You are a joyful and radiant soul.    urlLink   What Is Your Soul's Trait?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Classes continue to go well. My Field Experience class is a sophomore-level class to help someone decide whether they want to become a teacher or not. Lots of basic information and tech skills (such as "how to use email" and "how to search on the internet;" needless to say, I'm "bored out of my mind.") that we'll supposedly use in the classroom. Anyway, I've turned in everything ahead of schedule, so I get to play around during class time, which is cool, but it sucks that I'm paying about $1000 to do it.  Anyhoo, send me strength. Next session, I have a class that meets at 7:50 in the morning, followed by steady classes all day. ::le sigh::
