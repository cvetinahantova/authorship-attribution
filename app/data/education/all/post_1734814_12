What to say, actually had this blogger for close to a year now, but haven't bothered to start typing. Most of what i have to say gets posted on various forums around the web.  haven't had a coffee for several hours, so nothing interesting to type. Eithre need caffeine fix or to be so early in the morning that i'm beyond tired and don't care what i'm posting.  Oh yeah, got a job. Start thursday. science teaching WCC.
