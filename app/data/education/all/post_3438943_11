Welcome Aboard, hopefully the other will follow suit.    Headed to AC Moore today to get plant life for Mire Witch.  1/2 the felt things for the army are cut and ready to glue. Looks like we'll have 24 total. Looking for philosopher stones too.  Hoping my cool witch hands make it in time for the event.  Anybody need stuff at AC Moore?
