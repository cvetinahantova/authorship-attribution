I've mentioned  urlLink Stellastarr*  before -- well, not here and maybe not on the web, wait... -- but they just ripped out a great song on Kilborn. Stellastar* is a little bit Bowie, a little bit The Cure, a little bit Joy Division, a little bit Talking Heads and a whole lotta 21st century brass ones. Plus, they've a blonde on bass. As in ace. Or ass. Depending upon where you're staring. Anyway, blonde on bass. Win-win, baby!   urlLink My Coco - WMP   urlLink My Coco - Real
