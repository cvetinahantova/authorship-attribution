Today's a BrotherWatch day, and I've already been shocked and awed by the little turd.  The conversation (no kidding) that just ensued:  LT: "Are you gonna vote for a new president or the President that's already there?"  Me: "The same guy."  LT: "Yeah, he is the best. But I would be better. Would you vote for me if I was President? When I'm old enough? Would you vote for me for another year?"  Me: "Maybe."  LT: "If I had 250 chances, would you vote for me 250 times? I think you would. I'm gonna vote for the same guy. George W. Bush. Did you know his name?"  Me: (laughing) "Yeah."  LT: "Because I just told you, right?" Then the topic shifted abruptly from elections present and future to science.  LT: "I know what electricity looks like. When it lights sump'in up, it makes it red." Ladies and gentlemen, your 2048 Republican presidential candidate. Vote early and often.
