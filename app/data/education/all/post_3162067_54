According to my pupils, my listening to Jazz Legends CD on a continuous loop is a sign of my vast pretenciousness (my words, not theirs...which perhaps compounds this fact a little...) Well, can't say that I disagree with them. I think it's been another pleasant looking day. I wore my new Monsoon top in bright Fuschia. The lessons were good, although my bottom set year sevens nearly made my brain bleed. However, my other lessons were a good success. 8 more teaching days to go.....
