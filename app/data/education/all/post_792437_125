Sunshine rules..    Â  Ahh, the relief and happiness sunshine brings. Something about it, it just makes you feel good! I'm currently sitting outside on my laptop in the beautiful sunshine. It feels so good! Guess the picture doesn't really cut it, as a laptop in the wilderness (is it?) doesn't fit. I mean a laptop in this beautiful scenery doesn't go! oh well! I needed sunshine. We've had way too much rain in such a loooong time, that I was starting to wonder when that nice yellow light from the sky would peak in!
