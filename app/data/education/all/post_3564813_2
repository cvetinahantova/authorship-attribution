WOW! Today was the hotest day of the year so far! I dunno by how much, but it was really hot all day! Also, today was the first day since the 1800's in which the planet Venus passed infront of the Sun! I didn't get a chance to see it because I was in school and you can't look at it with your naked eye.  Anyho, at school we returned back to Product Design, which is a million times better than Food Tech, because the teachers are better and... who want's to cook food, anyway, after watching Gordon Rammsay's "Hell's Kitchen".  CAD - Carefuly Aplied Deodrant! What's that!? You DON'T use deodrant? Shame on you, shame on you! You smelly little toerag, you must start wearing a range of plesant smelling fr√©quence's. Nah, never mind, I just wanted to tell you that James put the above down in his Manufacturing test, and still got a higher mark than me!  Today we had Ms Seath instead of Mrs Turner for Music, it was a really nice change since all we did was play keyboards etc. Nothing else really to say, apart from I probably won't be able to write any more today because I'm going to Darren's soon.
