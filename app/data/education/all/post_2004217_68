7 years. 7 bloody years of never, ever being late for school, only taking whole days off for illness if I physically couldn't get out of bed or open my eyes, and today, 4 weeks before I leave the damn place, and all the clocks and alarms in the house go CRAZY and somehow I wake up at 5 past 9 in the morning. "Grrr" just doesn't cover it.  The Leeds festival lineup was announced yesterday, prompting me to virtually explode with joy in my dad's car:  Confirmed: Green Day, 50 Cent, The Offspring, The Darkness, Ash, The Hives, Morrisey, The White Stripes and The Libertines.  Rumoured: Blink 182, Lostprophets and Funeral For A Friend.  *dies*  Joy also occurred yesterday at the re-discovery of not only MSG+ (doo doo doo-doo, doo doo-doo, doo doo-doo!) and a lil ole thing called Sick-Happy... watch this space ;o)  Musical update! Current interest: Hip hop. I downloaded half of the new NERD album and half of 50 Cent's album today and yesterday, which worries me in case I develop the urge to start a collection. But the NERD album is only Â£8.99 from CD Wow... ahh, the trials and tribulations of being a teenager.  Talking of trials and tribulations, I put my giant size 8s right in it yesterday by announcing to Coz that Kat had a spare boyfriend called Nigel who lived in Smethwick, which (somehow!!) seemed very real to him and made him get mad at Kat (boo). Tsch. I can't be arsed with boys right now (this is in no way influenced by yesterday's event, it just relates to it slightly); they just seem to get in the way. This summer, I want to hang out with my friends, drink, party, go to gigs and generally chill out before I pack my bags and go to uni; a boyfriend just doesn't figure in the equation. Good! :o)  Ceff x   Was a po' nigga, now I'm a rich nigga...
