Yep.  I just finished playing Freelancer... and it was very intense. I'm so tired, and my hand is kind of frozen in one position, like it's cupped around the mouse permanently, lol. I was in a very INTENSE battle that took like forever, but I defeated my enemies and brought back a whole 1000 dollars. Well, that's a small amount, but I worked so hard for it *tears*  I joined the Liberty Navy.   The thing is, I joined a mod they're beta testing, and you can't play anything else except that once you install the mod software. It's TOTAL WAR. That means, if you die, you die and you have to start a new character all over again. lol. That hasn't happened to me yet, and it probably will sometime, and I predict that I will have an angry fit.   I just started playing and I'm pretty far. I had to collect 300 000 dollars to join one of the guilds... and you HAVE to join one of them. You gain about 5000 dollars a mission, so it takes a while. Fortunately, I play with my dad and he kept giving me tons of money... 40 000 dollars at a time. I'm so lazy. lol.  So what takes some people a few hours only took me 45 minutes. I tried playing alone and I hardly get any money. He must have some secrets. The thing is with that server, they're really strict. If you press F1 and exit the game if not docked, or when in space, you get banned, because it's considered a cheat. If you're in a battle, you can exit and come back and the enemies will be gone. So yes, it's cheating. You can use it while docked though.  It's like intense training for n00bs... and yes, I am a noob. It even says that right next to my name in brackets... [n00b]. I feel so special.   Well, it's time to go to sleep now... My attempts at downloading V:TM failed. Goddamn. Night!
