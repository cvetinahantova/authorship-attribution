HAHA.  I wrote on a script today, sucka.  15 pages.  Be it crap or not, knock on wood, I'm back.  It felt good not to be a lazy a-word.  more writing to come.  Jesse and I are dedicating August to scripts (because we have no jobs) so the hope is 2 more will be cranked out in the next 30 days. other note, i might head up to seattle for a few months.  Trevor and I want to make movies, so let's do it.  I need to apply at Tully's and Seattle's best.  and worst. my buddy holly glasses broke.  Don't weep for them, they will live again. Poll: What picture of my trip would you like to see next? a) me in front of a lake, b)  me in front of clouds and a lake, c) me and people I chilled with, d) a lesbian lacrosse player drowning, e) a special request of your own choosing.  food. i eat it as we all do.  maybe a bit too much at times.  today? buffet. yuk Grand China Star buffet.  sick.  gooey chicken, rangoon things, mayonaise imitation crab meat, general moo moo's liver delight, squid weenie, ox butthole.  yeah, I really ate that.  No lie. anyway.  The whole buffet system is excessive in my mind. Case in point: a buddy of mine went to grand old county buffet.  He looked over and saw a fat mom, fat dad, and fat little kid gorging themselves on plates and plates of fried chicken, pizza, assorted meats and cheeses and whatnot. the Fat Kid says to his mom. "How do I know when to stop eating?" yuck. So them mom says, "When It hurts." thank you. Enjoy your happy meal and don't let mayor McCheese hit you on the a-word on the way out.
