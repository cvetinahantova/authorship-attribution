Suck it  Harder , Yankees   If you didn't know, the Sox picked up the second game of the series yesterday.  Today, Lowe, who was 2-0 against the Yankees last year, faces Contreras, who I don't have any numbers on off-hand, but I can confidently say to more often suck than not suck against the Sox lineup.     urlLink Alex Rodriguez, Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield are a combined 0-for-19  in the first two games of the series, as the Yankees' team batting average has slipped to .206 on the season.   And, I believe, Jeter only has one hit in the series.  Let's see how classy those Yankee fans are now.
