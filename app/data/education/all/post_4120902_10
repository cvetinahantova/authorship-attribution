My brother will make a perfomance in the first week of Malaysian Idol finals. Hope he will make a great perfomance and of course, i will vote for him. My family wants to celebrate my birthday on the same day with the concert but i said i'm sorry, my brother is more important for me. so, they don't have other free time and i think that i won't celebrate my birthday with my family this year but hey... i still got my friends around me. I wonder what they have as a present for me. So, this friday.. i'm going to relax and watch my brother sing a song and becoming the first Malaysian Idol!!!   -I love you , bro!!!-
