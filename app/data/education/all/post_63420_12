For those who are in the job market and want to search online, the first step is usually to go to one of the big general sites like  urlLink Monster  or  urlLink HotJobs  (owned by Yahoo!) or one of the industry-specific sites like  urlLink Dice  (IT) or  urlLink HigherEdJobs  (....uh, higher education).  Of course, these sites work if the employer posts their openings to these national sites.    If you are looking for local postings try instead a site like  urlLink FlipDog  (now owned by Monster) which aggregates and indexes company job listings on their own web site.    Or try  urlLink Craig's List  which offers postings within in each city that the site serves.  For those who want to search multiple CraigList sites, you can download and install these  urlLink PHP scripts  and load them on your own server.  (The result will be something like  urlLink this .)
