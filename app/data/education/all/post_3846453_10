Chellsy: Hello everyone! Last night we went to a P-A-R-T-Y! T'was very good.  Miriam (and Roisin)stayed sober as usual which was very good as someone had to keep an eye on Rachel.  I'm feeling quite awake this morning so maybe i don't suffer from hangovers :D  Miriam: Last night was very funny indeed. Bloody toilet. It had a lock (for once) but a hole in the window so either someone had to go in with you and cover the hole up, or stand outside making sure no-one looks. Rachel. OH MY GOD. She was so pissed. She started hugging EVERYONE! We even thought she was making out with Dale at one point!!! Was it me, or did Dale make out with NICOLE? (Chellsy: If he did...god help u sweetie!)Anyway, I stayed sober again, just to make sure everything was alright! Heeheehee. Chellsy fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow!!! I stayed awake reading some rubbish book, coz I couldn't sleep, until I got bored with it, and stared at my ceiling in the dark. (Chellsy: Well i was drunk AND tired so who could blame me) Hmmm....you're so lucky my dad didnt catch you OR Rachel when we gave them a lift home. Poor cab driver.
