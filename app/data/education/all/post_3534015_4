There is nothing like the unexpected to perk one right up.  I have a new job now.  It was confirmed this morning, I start one week from today.  I have a front desk and a fairly nice computer.  The chair looks quite comfortable.  I will be doing a variety of tasks, but mostly I will be assisting the program co-ordinator.  My paycheck has been bumped up to a little over $2/hr more than I am making now, which is nice.  If all that extra money goes directly into savings, I should have a nice comfortable pillow in about a year.   The beautiful thing about this job is that it came out of no where.  It is such an amazing blessing!!!
