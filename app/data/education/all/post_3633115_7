So we just got back from visiting the in-laws.  We spent most of the day today just sitting around their house.  BORING.  I asked S why didn't we go to the 1895 jail house (with gallows) turned museum when he and C, my father-in-law, had talked about going.  S didn't have an answer.  I said, even if it was closed, we could have just driven around the town and see what little there was to see.  His reply to this was that his parents were probably new to the area and didn't know their way around, so didn't have anything to show us.  Now, I'm thinking that this explanation is silly.  Half the fun of a new place is learning what all there is there.  To me that means driving around aimlessly.  When I was a kid, my dad was in the Air Force.  The first thing my brother's and I would do in a new place was go explore.  After we found our bikes of course.  I suppose that not exploring a new town is just a strange thing to me.  I guess when you have people that have lived in the same town for better than 30 years (though both come from military backgrounds), you kind of forget the fun in getting lost then trying to find your way home.
