Check out  urlLink Forty Days of Purpose   Katy and I are going to be doing this as a GREAT way to start out 2004.  One chapter per day for fourty days.  Check out the URL above and see if this is something you would like to do to enhance your heart attitude for 2004. It does not matter where you are at in your spiritual journey. All that matters is that you realize that you have not arrived and that you too can learn something.  Sometimes it is not a matter of learning something new but rather it is the ability to apply what you have learned in such  a way that it makes your life better.  Sometimes small changes can make a world of difference.  When we change our heart attitude and our mental attitudes about the things in our lives not only will we be better for it but our lives will be more peaceful and full of joy.  When that happens those around us see a difference and they like being around us more.  When we can see change in us then we can eventually affect change in the people around us in our community.  All it takes is the willingness to understand that we have not arrived at all knowledge and that God can show us something new about himself and about our world that HE created for us.  Maybe the commitment will take some sacrifice.  I am figuring it will take a minimum of 15 minutes per day and maybe even 30.  It is highly recommended by Rick Warren that you take the time to read the devotional, scriptures listed and then meditate , pray and then journal what is being shown to you in your spirit.   I will be posting here in my blog some of those insights as I feel led to post them.  No matter whether you decide to do the Fourty Days of Purpose devotional or not, I encourage you to do something.  Do something that will increase your pursuit of God in your life.  You will be a winner if you do.  God bless      James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net
