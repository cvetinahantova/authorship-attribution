I was doing some research for my novel, searching the web for a little history of the term 'WASP' and when it was first used. One of the links that came up on Google led me to a White Nationalist web site called  urlLink Stormfront.org . I poked around it a little bit, and now I feel somewhat sick.   It's easy to forget how many hateful assholes are out there. But what's really surprising to me is the fact that they're actually literate. I mean, the spelling and grammar in their bulletin board posts (with subject lines like "Cultural Differences, or are Blacks Just Plain Stupid?") is actually not bad. Which suggests that these people read books. And if they read books, how can they be so goddamned ignorant? I suppose if the only books you read are along the lines of  Mein Kampf , you can write a decent sentence and still have Neanderthal views of race and humanity. Still, it amazes me that people who think like that aren't living in caves and eating their own excrement. As they ought to be.
