So this morning I tried for the third time to go to the Army museum.  The first day I was kind of short on money and didn't want to blow my last little bit on the museum.  Yesterday it was closed b/c from some reason it's closed on Friday and Monday.  And today the electricity was off.  I think I've pretty much given up. Instead I did go to the prison museum which was dubbed as the "Hanoi Hilton" by Americans during the war.  This isn't to be confused with the real Hitlon hotel in Hanoi.  This was an interesting experience.  I even got to see Senator John McCain's (sp?) picture up on the wall as he did 6 or 7 years there.  We then took a walking tour around the old district.  It was here I managed to get my most prized souvenir of my trip.  I picked up all six contructicons which together form devastator.  I only expect a few people to understand this.  I think Fountin, Jason and possibly Serd can appreciate how cool this is.  Of course they are fake, made in China I think.  But they are great quality, stickers and everything.  Gotta love it.     Right now it's a lunch and internet break.  Afterwards we'll finish up walking around and I'll try to get some glasses and maybe we'll do some other stuff.   Tomorrow I think the plan will be to chill out a little and try to find a decent tour to Halong bay and to Sappa.  Then it'll be off to Laos.  I don't think I've ever sweated as much in life.
