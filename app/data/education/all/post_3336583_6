Now I know why I really like this blogger thing. It's not because it serves as a great procrastination tool (as previously stated), it's because it requires no reflective statements on crap that does not improve my teaching ability, no citations on works by some random person who has probably never taught a day in their life, no APA formatting, etc...   Basically a blog could also be known as a place to post your bitch sessions for the world to read (see previous paragraph). Or a place to share your most embarrassing moments (like the time when I wet the bed...and I wasn't the only adult in the bed) so others can make fun of you for eternity. Or a place to share what's going on in your life to friends you don't talk to often but wish you did. Or...okay, so the possibilities are endless.   Did I mention I am soooooo burned out with grad school?
