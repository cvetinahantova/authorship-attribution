The last message I realise was worthy of being turned into a book. However, I promise to keep this post quite short (in comparison!).  This is just a little message to shout out Wa Hooo! I added a counter to my blog for curiosity sake and today it recorded the 100th visitor to my blog since last week. That's an achievement and I am very proud of it! I would like to thank ...........     (SHUT UP OH ANCIENT ONE!!!)     Ok, sorry!  Good night all!
