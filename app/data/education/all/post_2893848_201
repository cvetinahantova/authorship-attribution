This is the end by scott  I am trying to compile a list of rock n rollers with poetry books to write an editorial on this phenomenon. So far I've come up with Billy Corgan, Jeff Tweedy, Jewel (whose book by the way is the number one poetry book of all time, which says nothing, but still), David Berman from Silver Jews, Mike Doughty from Soul Coughing, and Tupac's got one I think. I'm thinking more contemporary (sorry Doors fans, no America's poet). Do any Impeccable readers out there know of any others?
