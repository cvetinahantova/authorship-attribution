my roommate sophomore year is a cartographical savant.  He has a subscription to National Geographic solely for the detailed maps of distant rainforests and deserts.  He knows the political (and sometimes the cultural) capital of every nation in the world......even the Federated States of Micronesia.  My question is this: does it serve a purpose?  I haven't come to a juncture in life where knowing that Kinsasha is the capital of the Congo.  Perhaps our world would be more peaceful if we could all know the tributary rivers of the Danube, or the archipelago patterns of the south Pacific......then again, all this arcane knowledge has driven me to putting dynamite in dumpsters.......my apologies to all unsuspecting dumpster divers.  ______________________________  I have a friend who moved far away.
