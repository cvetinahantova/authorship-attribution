Things are looking up lately. We're getting things settles on the car, the bank finally got around to setting up an internet account, so I can keep track of when the checks are run through, it turns out that we had a little more money than we thought (which is good, because insurance is due), and I get to sleep in tomorrow. That really excites me, for some reason.  Rehearsals are starting to kick in, as are the various projects for my upper-level classes. And, yeesh, there's a lot of them. Thankfully, I've been able to look at my schedule and set aside blocks of time in which to get things done. And ahead of schedule, which is good.  Lemme think...other news...  Oh, an old college friend of mine, Julie Clements, just had a baby. She emailed me a picture of him this morning, and he is absolutely beautiful! but then, it's also weird to think of people that I went to school with having kids and getting older. I mean, I don't think I'm getting older. In my mind, I just graduated high school. And yet, I saw a friend of mine the other day who just turned 30 and has two kids. Yeesh.  Ok, back to work on my Contemporary Drama paper, and then eat a sandwich while studying for Christian Home. Why does the sandwich seem to be the best part of that?
