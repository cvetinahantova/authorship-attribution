Once again, I feel lazy, which means I must write something.  LOL  Amazing how inspiration can change at certian moments.    They've posted the hours for fall classes.  Don't you know every class I want is in the evenings.  I'm a little saddned by this, since I wanted all day classes, it would work well with my evening job.  So now I have to find a way to work with this, so I can make some money, and advance my edu.  I feel so conflicted.  That sucks.  I paid for my cat to get his shots and a bath.  I paid waaaaay too much money.  If he wasn't loved, I wouldn't do it, so I don't mind doing it, but it did put a dent in my wallet.  Fortunately, I have most of my bills paid already, and one heafty car note.  Can't do without the ride, especially sinces it's a good ride.  LOL.
