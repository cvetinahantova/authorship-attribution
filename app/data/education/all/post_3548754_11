AAAAAARRRRRGGGGG!!! Whatta day!!! I've bee alone here in the office since before lunch. They're all out on offsite. Gosh, no one to talk to... Kuya chino is sick pa...haaay.  Still no final paper for Infote. Emailed and called Charles that I'm swamped with work and I'm all alone. Gosh! It's 10 to 7pm and I'm still in the office.OT until 9pm. I'm now running a fever. Even if I wanted to go home I cant. Had 3 more walk in students so had to photocopy more manuals.  Oh men...  Called Mike this afternoon. Might go the printers to discuss the invites after getting the ring on Saturday. In the meantime, i printed a draft. Also called Ate. Told her to scout for the technical rider of my band already.  Played badminton the other day for the first time in my entire life. I can say I learned pretty fast. Have a sore arm to show it.Hehehe. I agree it's good exercise. I was sweating like a pig...and pigs dont sweat!! Hahahaha. Myk said we'd play again this Saturday.Am I gonna get addicted like I did when I learned playing billiards??? We'll see.  i gotta update this blog more often...
