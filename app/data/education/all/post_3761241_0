i took a stroll down memory lane on a fine saturday morning - bright and full of life at nine o'clock in the mornin'. not so hot, yet not so cold, the breeze upon you on a summer day and the only thing you must assume, is that this, will always stay.  as i walked out the door, i took a right instead of a left, and as i do, i soon deduce the peculiars of memory lane. the funny thing about memory lane was you never know what's next since the intersections keep changing, is the next marx or elaine?  on this particular morn, it seemed t'was maine so strange to realize as i looked behind me the scenary changed for it seemed obvious to see that this was not what i knew as memory lane.  for as i had walked out my door, the sight that i saw were of people who stayed, household and all and yet as i view the sight at the present position, i only see empty locations.  yet i did not turn back to run for my house for my legs refused to move in that direction it seemed that i could only go forward and i did with great reluctance.  i turned forward to see new neighbors entering dear memory lane, and as i walked past each and every one, i see them all move out their homes.  i soon decided to return home, and took a cab since i couldn't walk and soon found my house demolished along with the rest of memory lane.  does one move forward, or does one stay back? does one move out empty handed?  i did as a matter of fact move out of memory lane, for present was no more for me at memory lane.  the past is for remembrance the present for the actions, the future is for what is to be and memory lane is all three.
