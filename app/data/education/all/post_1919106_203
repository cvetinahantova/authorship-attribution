One of the assignments due soon require me to write some program in C, C++, or Java. Now, the problem is that I haven't seriously used any of those for a year and a half or so (though it feels like more than that). I never  needed  to. So I'm pretty rusty on any of those.  Java is, in any case, out of the question. I abhor the language. That leaves me with a choice between C and C++. Today I've started writing the base of my program - a linked list - in C. Which would have been ok, except that I've been spoiled by proper O-O languages (read:  urlLink Ruby ), and my brain now refuses to think in a procedural way. It would be very easy to write this program if I make some assumptions and use a few global variables, but I just can't. It feels  wrong . So I'll end up writing the whole thing in C++. Now the problem I foresee is that all my C++ experience is pre-gcc3.x. So I'm not used to the slight new variations, such as having to use  namespace std  or using  &lt cstdio &gt  instead of  &lt stdio.h &gt  and whatnot. Which shouldn't be too much of a problem in itself, but it's a nag.  On the good side, I have the good fortune of having brought along with me the book I used in Data Structures at TAMU-CC, and that has pretty much all the definitions of data structures I need. So I'm going to drag it out of the drawer at work where it's collecting dust and put it to good use.
