mrs ler sent me a christian article. funnily it's titled "the alternative lifestyle". talking abt having affairs..and a little bit on homosexuality. mm..wondering how come she's sending me this article. maybe just sharing ba.  "While having more than one partner can also result in disease-some ofwhich are life threatening, homosexuality is an unnatural function that leads to a depraved mind."  "  The world's view may be to accept "alternative lifestyles," but God's Word simply calls it sin.   You'll never be as close to God as you could be while living in sin. Yet, if you stay close to God, you won't desire to live in sin. Obedience to God's plan for marriage will enable you to discover the beauty of your sexuality; given and received the way God intended."  these two quotes are taken from the article.well, the 2nd one really struck me,for tt's wat i learnt thru "it". that time i realise tt the world really viewed "it" as acceptable..but it's not for christians lor..we all know wat it is considered in God's eyes. moreover,i really couldn't be close to Him when i was in "it"..n now tt i'm close to Him, i dun desire to live in "it".  tt's why i say the 2nd one really struck me.tt's exactly wat i'm experiencing all these while..very cool...=)
