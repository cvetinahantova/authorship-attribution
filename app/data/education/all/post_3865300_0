urlLink Net-Wise Teens: Safety, Ethics, and Innovation    Overall, I thought this was a very informative article.  However, I could not relate a lot of it to my teaching situation because my kids fall into that 59% of free and reduced kids that do not have a computer (article said that 41% have home internet access).  I really liked the idea that 6th graders are required to take an Internet Skills course at the Prospect Sierra school.  We have a  technology  class that is offered as an elective, but every time I walk by the classroom I see the kids just playing games on the computer.  I really think our technology instructor should read this article to get some ideas on what to teach the students.  There were many websites mentioned in the article that I have never heard of, but seem like they would be helpful.  I would like to check some of them out, and then share them with my students.  The article also brought up the point of making sure your AUP is up to date, and to be honest, I've never seen ours.  So that is something else that I am going to look into.
