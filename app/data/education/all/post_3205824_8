Worth considering: do party politics always highlight the -least- significant issues?  Has anyone else noticed that abortion, gay marriage, and the judicial appointments have been trumping the economy, education, crime, and prisons?  In a 1998 study of Victorian parliamentary and party politics, T.A. Jenkins locates the origins of contemporary bipolar party stability in the period 1832-1900.  In Brief: Britain invents party whips, parliament now responds to the mass electorate very quickly, real issues go away and candidates are left with little to argue about: you get either blundering stability of everyone in agreement, or a dumb middle doing nothing besieged by radical backbencher crazies from either side.  In the name of more stable government, suppose you and the other common-sense members of your party are looking for an issue with which to draw voter attention.  The only thing that can promote one candidate over another turns out to be controversial, scandalous issues which really have little to do with anyone, which most voters don’t react to except by dismissing the either side: in this case, Home Rule for Ireland.  It just struck me as I was reading what a great deal this has to do with gay marriage.  Not that I’m not 220% for gay marriage, but that I have a sense that it, like abortion, is being dragged out right now simply because most people don’t care (at least this is what I’m beginning to hear about the middle west, the middle class church, etc) – but that aligning for and against it can make a mandatory show of party allegiance without actually alienating anyone already in one’s party.
