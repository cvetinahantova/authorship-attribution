And I thought that I had it bad...   Sure, what went on just a week ago was the emotional low for me this semester (it actually being the first time that I had to go out and ask for help) but it doesn't nearly match up to what has been happening to the group this last week. The worst thing of it is that I know that there is nothing I can do to help, but there is nothing I would want to do more than that. It's like having to stand by the road and watch your house burn down. I know that time will fix everything, but I only wish that this will happen soon enough for us to spend a happy last semester together. I want to leave with happy memories, thoughts I can hold on to when I feel down. Maybe it's just a romantic idea, but that's somethign that the world is missing lately. What happened to all those stories of heroes? Why did they get replaced with  E! ,  Fox News , and all that other scum? When has the world become so selfish? Bah, I don't want to talk about sad stuff anymore.
