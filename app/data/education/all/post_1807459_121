Little time to blog here before work.  So I finally got money sent home.  This was a huge ordeal with tons and tons of obsitcles but apparently it's finally over with.  I'm still waiting for something to go wrong.  I found what appears to be a good deal on tickets to Thailand so that might be where Gumi James and I are going to go.  I ended up having to work on yesterday but no big deal.  Weather was crappy anyway.  So tomorrow I need to hit the travel agent and then I'll go to the zoo and go shopping.  I'd like to buy the lonely planet travel books they have at Kyobo but they are so damn expensive.  I've debated on going to Myanmar (Burma) but I've ruled that would be pretty much crazy.  I should have tomorrow off.  I think I won't pick up my phone so they can't find me in the event they need someone to work.   I might hang out with Hey-sook tonight and hit up WABA.  I think this place might be a little bit of heaven on earth.  She has some super tough test today so afterwards I told her I'd take her out to eat.  Incidently WABA is her favorite place too.  Match made in heaven huh?   Why aren't the rest of you other bloggers updating?  You guys are really dragging ass.  I need more stuff to read.  0 spell check.
