Returned from the  urlLink AIR Conference  in Boston this week.  Presented my  urlLink demonstration  of Q Methodology and was able to attend quite a few other interesting sessions on retention, swirl, survey techniques and other IR topics.  (The day after returning another Continental flight from Cleveland to Boston received a military escort due to a mistaken transmission made by the pilot.)  Also had a chance to run and roam around the  urlLink Harvard  and  urlLink MIT  campuses and got to see the  urlLink Stata  building at MIT, designed by Frank Gehry.  Much larger in scope and size than the  urlLink Peter B. Lewis building  he designed for  urlLink Case .
