guys i bet some of u noticed a big error in one of the entries, regarding  k-ci and jojo ...who are  fantasia barrino 's cousins... i thought that the  jojo  who sang  leave (get out)  was from  k-ci and jojo , only to realize that  k-ci and jojo  are male and  jojo  is female, so both are completely different...  jojo  is 13 years old...the youngest i guess out of so many super young teenage pop queens like  hilary duff, avril lavigne, ashlee simpson  ( jessica simpson 's younger sis),  amy studt  and  joss stone , so i think that's remarkable and i respect her...plus she has an amazing voice! hope u got the message guys...gonna do homework, catch up soon!
