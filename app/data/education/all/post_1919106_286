Well, after an outrageous day of sleeping, sleeping, and more sleeping (Tuesday) I got back on track with work this morning with renewed energies. Assignment 3 for Operating Systems has been graded, and I can say that nearly all of my groups did a superb job. Tomorrow is their final exam, so I have to be at the university by 8 (am) to get ready for proctoring, and after that we'll dive right into marking the finals. I predict that it will be painful like an acid trip on a Halloween party. But then again, tomorrow afternoon there's the SCS fun party meeting at Kennedy's pub in St. Agatha. So if you're in the CS department, head over there for beer and some fun. Plans are for folks to be arriving there around 5:30 - 6:00. I can only hope that we'll have the finals finished by then.  Friday and Saturday will probably be rush days too - the project for MPLSA needs wrapping up, that is, we need to get some shit done by Sunday. As said before, no big problem there, since we pretty much already covered all the aspects that we wanted to when writing up the bullet-list outline, but we need to actually go and write the stuff down now.
