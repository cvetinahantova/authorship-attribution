Harloe EVERYONE!!!! Im Back! Hehe.. Back to blog that is. Ahh.. Its been two weeks since i last updated. Been quite busy. With exams, projects and stuff. Its beyond imagination. Never really thought i could do all these. Went through an ordeal in this two-week period. Don really remember anything that i did during the week before exam. Bad memory. Hehe... No matter. The thing is... Im back. So you will see some new crap posting up  again.  Exams are excruciating. Never thought Form 4 could be so tough. Its supposed to be my honeymoon year. This should be the time when every person live out their teenage life best. Not sitting down and pouring over books that arent gona make any changes in my life. As if they are to meant to teach us survival skills and to be streetwise. I definitely dont see how memorizing morale values and its specific explanation is goin to help us to cultivate them. Mindless gits. Those people doin these in the education ministry. Anyway, i got 39/40 for my math objective paper. YAY!!! Never really expected that. But its still good. Hmm... I still got four more papers left for the week. Physics, Chem, Add Math and Acc.   Arghh!! This is boring...probably the most boring post of all... sorry..not really in a mood..cant thinkin of anytin to talk about. I do have lotsa stuff...but jus cant think at the moment..Fook out..
