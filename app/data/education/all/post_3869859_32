Went to the Stanford Theatre for the first time the other night to see some old 1940s movies!  Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948) involves Joan Fontaine's character as a stalker of a pianist. I could relate! Not in quite the same way, but lately I've felt a little like a stalker (haunted by an old love), and a little like I've been stalked! (Not in a bad way.)  Rebecca (1940). Wow! Joan Fontaine again (she's pretty cute!). A comedy, a romance, a drama, a mystery, a suspenseful thriller. Mrs. Danvers is probably the most creepy character ever! (A lesbian friend at work is convinced that Mrs. Danvers is one of the first lesbian film characters!)  I just didn't like the fact that the female characters in both of these movies were so attached to the men in their lives! Their happiness seemed to revolve around the men. Almost sickeningly so!
