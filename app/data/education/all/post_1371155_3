At an unearthly noctural hour Putu discovered the  urlLink online edition of Granta  and spent the next few hours devouring the  urlLink extracts  that are available online. Putu in particular would like to recommend,  urlLink Granta 77: What we Think of America , which has a series of marvellous essays, including two by Amit Chaudhuri and  urlLink Ramachandra Guha.  It ought to be read in conjuction with  urlLink Granta 84: How America Sees the World . Unfortunately to read most of the articles you need to subscribe, i.e. pay, which Putu will certainly not do. But if that's depressed you, you can always turn to the  urlLink features section  to cheer you up and look at  urlLink what Granta was reading in 2003 .
