I have several pet peeves when it comes to prayer. The first is this:  Someone is praying and informs God of things that are going on. Example:  "Dear Jesus, Mr. Jones is in the hospital with a fractured knee cap after getting in a very bad car accident. He's in a lot of pain. I know how much pain he must be in, so would you help him feel better, please?"  Like God doesn't know all of that already???? I know that prayer can be simply "talking" to God, but it just annoys me that some people have to pray as if they are informing God of what's going on down here on Earth.  More prayer pet peeves to come later on.......  Signing off.....  Current mood = ticked off. You may ask why....well,  see my next entry......
