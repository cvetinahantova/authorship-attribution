Did you know Deodorant actually melts?  I didn't.  But I found out yesterday when I brought it with me when I went to work and left it in the car, forgot to put it in my bag and take it in the school with me.   I went to pick it up later and well had to throw it in the garbage!  Couldn't use it because it was no longer a whole piece and was melted all down the side of the package!  Craziness!  It's just too hot!
