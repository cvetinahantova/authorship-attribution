So very tired   I'm exhausted. Tired. I feel as if my bones were missing. Right now, there's nothing I'd want to do more than just go back to take a nap. Um, wait. I take that back, there  are  things I'd rather do. Oh yes. Specially today. They don't include, however, things like doing homework, driving back to Waterloo, or doing anything productive to society.  I haven't noticed how out of sync I still am with school. Last semester I've gotten used to do - well nothing. I was at work most of the day, and I can do that. But school - spending hours at a computer looking up material... I can't do that anymore. Which means that I'm having second thoughts about my Ph.D. I might just go for a job after the Masters. Or maybe it is just that I need a sabbatical from studying. And computers. I might just work at a restaurant for a year or so, to clear my head. DO something that I  really  like to do. *shrugs* Eh, it'll work out somehow. But now I'll go call someone. Because I want to.
