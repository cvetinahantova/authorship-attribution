After I watched The Last Samurai, I got more interested in Japanese culture. I have got addicted to Japanese culture since my gradmother brought me into the contact with it, which was just something about daily life when Taiwan is colonized with Japan. And I searched for some information about it in World Book: Samurai were the members of hereditary worriors class in Japan. The early samurai defended the aristocrats' estates in the provinces. The samurai wore a protective helmet and armor. They use two curved swords, one long and one short. During the 1000's and 1100's, the samurai began to develop a tradition of values and personal conduct. They valued horsemanship, sill with the bow, strong self-discipline, and bravery. Above all, they prized total obedience and loyalty to their lords, and personal hornor. If the samurai were dishornored, they would consider it a duty to commit ritual suicide. The samurai began powerful after Yoritomo, the Minamoto clan leader, established the first  shogunate (worrior government) in the late 1100's. Their military strength and administrative organization provided a foundation for a long period of relative peace. In the 1300's to 1500's, under the weak Ashikaga shogunate, the samurai became the leaders of Japanese society but battled among themselves. The greatest of the worriors, called  daimyo , controled vast territories. After a period of control by local warlords, Japan was reunited in the late 1500's. In 1603, the powerful Tokugawa shogunate was established. The samurai then influenced every part of life until the mid-1800's, when the Japanese emperor regained full control.
