Apple Computer has posted  Steve Jobs' Keynote address from the 2004 WWDC   (Worldwide Developer's Conference) on its website. The Keynote starts with Apple's CEO thanking the 3500 registered developers from 44 countries who attended the event this week. The video-on-demand event is available exclusively in QuickTime and MPEG-4. I won't spoil the event by posting the details, so watch the keynote and tell me what you think!
