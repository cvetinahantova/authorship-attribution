Ok so i just lost almost 2 hours of my life.. 2 hours that i really wish i could have back.. but i can't.. Damn Bill and his crazy murderous hott chicks. that movie was pretty bad i never knew ppl bled that much.. makes me want to get a paper cut so i can repaint my room.. moving on.   i didn't have to work today which was good and bad, i'm still getting paid the full amount for the week and i got to sleep in today. so what was the bad part? i don't remember.. anyway! man i'm tired and really have nothing to babble about. this is a first for me you should all write this down and treasure it.. or.. something..   Chris called me last night. it was really nice to hear from him, he promised to call me today. We will see.. I'm excited about being out in the dating world again i missed it the last 2 months.. i wanna know how i didn't die my first what was it? 15 yrs not having a bf lol. now i can't handle being single for 2 weeks. Brandon is still sniffin' around and i want so bad to tell him to go away but i like knowing he wants me.. i'm mean..   we don't really need men. i mean just think about it. i have a job i have a car soon i'll be moving out. i have BJ (my cat you sickos) do i need a man? sure i want to have kids but.. all you need is those little white tadpoles.. so what happens if one day.. women take over the world.. and we could have like cryogenetically frozen men that you could just go by at walmart or something.. how cool would that be? i know i'm sadistic thank you.   i'm jk and if i've offended anybody.. well.. nothing i can do about that now! for real tho unfortunetly i have this need to feel needed. and i like having someone there who needs me it's this stupid motherly thing i have where i have to help and fix everyones problems.
