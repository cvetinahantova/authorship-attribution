Sarah started summer school this morning.  It was strange taking her to school and everyone else was just sleeping.  There seemed to be quite a few kids, a lot of them looked like the rougher sort, so I hope she does ok.  Last week the kids and I went down to Alabama to stay with my mom while my dad went to Portland to pick up my sister who is moving in with my parents.  My mom and I had to drive into Atlanta to pick up my dad's car from the long-term airport parking.  The trip went pretty well except for the part where my mom accidentally got off the interstate when the lane ran out instead of moving over.  She still talks about how harrowing the experience was.  It really worked out ok because we met up again at the rest stop as you enter AL.  She doesn't venture too far from home by herself much, so I guess that was pretty exciting for her.  We had originally planned to stay through Sunday because I wanted to go to my Dad's church, but we left early so Elizabeth could have the guest room.  I have mixed feelings about Liz's coming.  I'm glad to see her, she is my sister, but I really don't care for her life style.  I feel like my parents put up with a lot from her, in fact they almost seem to encourage it!  When my brothers and sisters are around I don't feel like I fit in with my own family.  It's very strange.  The only other real issue bothering me right now, besides how we are going to survive this summer and get Jacob off to college, is Sean's career.  He could go to a different restaurant in a second, but is that what he really wants to do?  I know he's getting very frustrated at work right now, but if he leaves this job, I would rather see him do something completely different.  Unfortunately, he would have to start so far down the ladder, that we probably couldn't survive financially.  I'm trying to trust God to take care of us, but it gets awfully hard sometimes.
