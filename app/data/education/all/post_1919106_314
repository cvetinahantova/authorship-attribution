Well, to day is some sort of Canadian Civic Holiday, and for what's worth of me I can't find out what we're holydaying. I'm pretty sure that it's not labor day. But then again, who says that you need a reason for a holiday? Perhaps the folks high up gathered and said "I'm bored. Let's declare today to be a holiday and go bar hopping."
