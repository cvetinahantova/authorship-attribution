Float On- Modest Mouse     Mr. Blue Sky - ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Soundtrack)         Change Your Heart - Beck (also Eternal Sunshine Soundtrack)     Sleeping With The Lights On - Teitur          Little Bird - Annie Lennox (I find her music interesting since the concert)         Heaven - Los Lonely Boys ( I find it to be an honest, catchy pop rock song)     The Strokes - Room on Fire album (It counts as 1 becuase it's 1 Playlist!)     U2 Notre Dame Concert (Yes, I realize I am cheating,  but it was 1 experience)     Blind Melon - No Rain (Don't Ask)     Remy Zero - Save Me ( I don't care what you say, Smallville Theme or not, I think it rocks!)      There's probably more, but that's it for now. When will this new U2 Album come out? Whoever stole it, please give it back or release it so they will please!?
