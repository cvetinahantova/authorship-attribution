Guido Westerwelle, the leader of the liberal party in Germany (the Freie Demokratische Partei) has come out, according to the story mentioned below. It's been an open secret that Westerwelle was gay, and friends of mine have reported flirting with him at gay restaurants in Berlin. But he's never stated it publicly before.  His party, the FDP, is a socially liberal, pro-business party--liberal in that classic 19th-century sense. I think many progressive Americans would find it to be a comfortable home. But in Germany it is generally reviled by progressives, lefties, and academics. This is part because of its pro-business stands and its philosophical rejection of Marxism, which holds sway over many on the left. In addition, its pro-business attitudes have meant that it had a hard time cooperating with the unions who form the base of the social democratic party.   But the FDP also suffers from a perceived lack of character, because it is constantly coalescing with the majority party in order to get into power. It wanders back and forth between the SDP and the conservative Christian Democrats.   Since the emergence of the Greens, the SPD now has a logical coalition partner, so the FDP has coalesced more consistently with the conservatives. But the Greens are also a kind of liberal party in that 19th-century bourgeois sense, in my opinion, so it's interesting seeing the FDP and the Greens fight it out for what I suspect are many of the same voters.    urlLink Yahoo!
