One week, three days, three skills tests, fifty-odd standards, one career development profile, one KS3 Strategy essay and a partridge in a pear tree. That's all that stands between me and PGCE finality, QTS status glory.  Holy shit. This time in two weeks it will all be over. What the hell am I going to do?   Sleep, probably.  Today has been spent up to my elbows in wee little boxes and grids, filling out application forms like a bastard. I've done seven. SEVEN! That's good going by anyone's standards. Judging by my own recent work ethic it's a bloody miracle. Surely, surely, one of those puppies has my name on it?
