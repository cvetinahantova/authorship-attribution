In a press statement today, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United�s executive director,decried the notion that the Massachusetts high court�s ruling was out of line and opposed any scheme to alter the U.S. Constitution.  �I�m not worried about gay marriage,� Lynn said. �I am, however, very worried about the marriage between President Bush and Religious Right zealots. Our Constitution has never been amended to take away minority rights, and we should not be taking such an action now.  �The reaction to the Massachusetts ruling has been shrill and over-the-top. There is nothing radical about preserving individual liberty and demanding equal protection for all,� Lynn continued. �Nor is it extreme to uphold the separation of church and state, which is also what that decision did.�
