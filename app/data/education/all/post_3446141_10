Yay! Training is over! Finally!  They have all gone home.......don't get me wrong they are all nice people, it just gets tiring having to take care of them all week.  And I really feel like just taking a long ass nap right now.  But I can't because I am at work.  OH and YAY for cable and Internet now at home!!!  FINALLY!  lol, it really is sad how dependent we become on our computers and other gadgets for that matter.  My computer is one of my forms of communication; I really would be going crazy if I couldn't get online at work.  I don't know how Alicia and Tyler did it.  Anyway I am very excited that it is Friday!  This means I get to sleep in tomorrow morning and I just can't wait.  CAN'T WAIT.  I have missed my sleep.  In fact the other night, I was apparently missing it A LOT because after I got back from dinner with Tyler and Brett, I decided to just lay down in my room for a few minutes.  You know just rest my eyes.  Well I passed straight out!  I woke up at 3:00am still in my cloths, make-up on and all the lights on as well!  So I got up out of bed, washed my face, put my pjs on, turned off the lights and got back in to bed and slept for another 3 hours till I had to be up at 6:30.  Anyhow so I am looking forward to more sleep this weekend, and getting some things done on my room.  Ok that is all for today.
