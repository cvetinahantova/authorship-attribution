MY NEW SCHEDULE!       Well, last Friday I found out my new schedule.  It looks like I am going to be a lot busier my last few months in Japan.  Last year I had a maximum of 11 classes per week and having all 11 was pretty rare. In fact I was lucky when I had 5-6.  Now, I am scheduled to have 16 classes a week as well as a mandatory once a week Teizan english club meeting before classes start.  On Thursdays I will actually have 6 classes...yes, that is one during every class period.  Yuko (my JTE at the boys school) thought I was joking when I told her that I was teaching that many classes in a single day at Teizan and then went on to say that I wouldn`t be able to teach at Shiogama boys on Friday after that type of day.  I guess time will tell!   So anyway, that`s 16 classes, 10 at Teizan and 6 at Shiogama Boys which will be taught with 5 different Japanese teachers.  I will be teaching English communication classes as well as English I classes at Teizan and at the boys school I will be teaching 4 1st year communication classes and two 2nd year commercial classes (classes for students who do not plan to go to university).  Wish me luck!   Oh yea, so now I might not have as much free time to spend on the internet.  I will be at Teizan on mondays, tuesdays and thursdays and at the boys school on Wednesday anf Friday.  They really wanted to make my life difficult as one school starts at 9:15 now and the other I have to be there by 8:25!  Lets hope I can keep my days straight.
