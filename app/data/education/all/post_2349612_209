it's been a good trip -- really it has... too bad it's almost over...  this morning alliswan made us french toast for breakfast and then we were off... first on a tour of her school (bowling green state university), then to panera for lunch (yay portabello and mozarella sandwiches!) and then to other fun.  immediately after lunch we went to "grounds for thought", a local coffee shop/used book store she keeps telling me about... i had a stellar latte, we played a game of chess, and then attacked the books... got a cheap copy of _a mathematician's apology_ finally, and also a book about the physics of christmas -- e.g. talks about celestial candidates for what was the star of bethlehem (i scanned the chapter... apparently jupiter saturn and one other planet would have converges from earth's point of view and a comet came through the same area of the sky then too... kinda cool) and the physics of what would be necessary for reindeer to fly =P  after grounds for thought, which again, was an extremely quality place, we drove up north to maumee, OH (suburb of toledo) to see a movie... i had seen "13 going on 30" before, but alliswan hadn't and i liked it so much the 1st time i was more than willing to see it again. =P  after the movie we enjoyed the theater arcade for a bit... pinball, racecar games, and air hockey later, we're back in good old bowling green... dropped off my film between valpo and today to pick up on our way to dinner and then getting together with some of alliswan's other friends here later... all in all, a quality day. =)  for those of you trying to keep track of my whereabouts, after today, i'll have brunch with alliswan tomorrow, then drive to my aunt's place in pittsburgh tomorrow afternoon... wednesday i drive pittsburgh to jersey and then i get to orchestrate fun while relatively staying put for a bit... it's been a party. =)  later dudes =P
