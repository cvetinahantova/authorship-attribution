Okay well I figure if I write two seperate blogs, then well they wont count as a novel.  Well I would just like to say "YaY" cause well my stupid brother is leaving!! YAY!!! O and by the way, everyone has to go to Christina Ventura's Quincenera!!! It will be so much fun!! I know it will.  Well I would like to take this time to say I am very very bored.  And I want to know why no one! Looks at my blog, or my website.  I have 225 hits, and NO ONE BUT MY FRIENDS SIGN MY GUESTBOOK, OR COMMENT ON MY WEBSITE!!!  That's just not nice!! I would go to everyone elses website if they had one! I do, I go to everyone's website who asks me to go, and no one has even looked at my message board!!! That's so messed up!! Well fine, I will just go and not come on to the internet and answer everyones messages!! HA!  How do you like that!! Alisha will not be here anymore to write your annoying little novels!! And I wont be here to rebut someones idiodic comment. Well BUBYE, o before I go I would like to make my own Best ... Like in the year book.
