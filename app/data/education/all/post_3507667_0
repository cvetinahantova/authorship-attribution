And so it begins, my first slice at the Blog phenomenon.  The day is quiet, and the sun is warm, so naturally I find myself indoors at my computer.  So let's start off with a little bit of information about myself.  I'm a single dad, of two very beautiful and comical little girls named Jecynda-Lynn, and Marrissa ages 9 and 6 respectively.  I work full time for SkillSoft as a Mentor to a Global online learning community focusing on IT certifications. I'm considering a change of venue hopefully in the near future so that I can find myself in another part of our great country.  The farther west, the better in my opinion.  I enjoy writing, reading, walking, and spending time with my children and my black lab puppy named appropriately for a black lab, Winter.  This being my first posting and attempt at such a task, I will keep this short and to the point.  So, hopefully those who visit will enjoy themselves, and drop me a line to chat when they get a chance.  RLB.
