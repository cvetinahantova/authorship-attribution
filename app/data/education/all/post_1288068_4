Oh dear, there is so much work to do and yet I'm not doing any.  Rather, I am wiggling my feet around to Benny Goodman and His Swingin' Band and considering whether I need to buy more yarn to finish this lacy number I am knitting. We also have Pimms, thanks to online impulse-grocery-shopping.  I seem to have turned into my grandmother.  What is to become of me? Come on!
