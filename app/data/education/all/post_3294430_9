haya suburi can make you see stars. exactly what i experienced three training sessions ago. almost fainted, almost gave up, but i endured, ego not letting me do so. i will endure and make kendo an essential part or my life. good news, i've been given the ok to buy my bokken. nihonkendokata will be starting in another two or three weeks. only 6 so far out of 27 have been given the ok. i'm very proud of myself.
