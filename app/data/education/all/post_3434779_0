Well I haven't typed in here for a couple days, so there's gonna be a lot.  Today I skipped my firehall meeting to go shopping, and the bitch ass cashier forgot to ring up one of my skirts that I bought, so I'm mad. I just found out that my big sister is getting me outta school early on Friday to take me to the ocean for memorial day weekend, and we gonna be sooo fucked up the whole time! yay! Tomorrow I plan on going to my bestest friend Liz's house and partying, cause her mom is working till 1 a.m. it will be great. Me n Johnny officially haven't spoken to each other for 24 hours, we got in a hell of an argument last night, so I need to apologize severely. But I will eventually. Me and that girl Justine that I bad mouthed a few days ago in here are getting along and good friends again. My birthday is in 18 days, and we have 10.5 days left of school, that's only like 72 more hours! yay!! I am gonna take my moms advice on Johnny, and just be his best friend, cause he's scared of a relationship, and everytime we start to get close he backs off. So yea.  Well that's about it for now. I will try to write again tomorrow!  Much love!! ~~Kirsten~~
