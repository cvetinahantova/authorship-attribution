One of the many things I learned at TAMU-CC is that it sometimes is OK to not finish a project. It happens in real life - things get delayed, expectations are too high... One way or another, people here at UWaterloo get too worked up if they can't finish a project. They start acting as if it's a matter of life and death. Much of it is a result of this university's ties with the tech industry. Professors are scared of taking on risky projects because they might fail, and it does not look good in the eyes of the IT overlords when professors fail. So they stick to low-risk projects, and always try to find a justification for doing things. I wish that for once someone here apart from me would just do things "because it's neat/cool/interesting". Everyone's so uptight here, they all walk around as if they were really constipated.
