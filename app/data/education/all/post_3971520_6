OK, guys. I know it has been a long time. Forgive me. I have been working 12, sometmes 14 hour days (today) and I am so tired when I get home, I don't even look up walking through the house. I go straight to bed. I have to be at school at 6:15 every morning and next week it will be 6. As you may know, we have morning practices and we do not get out of school until 3:50. That makes for a long day. I am usually there until 6, on average. That will lighten up as the weeks progress. Being a coach is hard work, but I love it and I wouldn't trade it for any other job. It is a feeling of fulfillment that I have never fealt before. I feel like this is my place. I am having a few classroom management issues in my English classes, but that will get better. I have some techniques to try. We will see how that works. My classes usually contain about 30 sudents. That is a lot, compared to when we were in school and had about 20. Ten is a big difference. My largest class is about 34. Anyway, I miss you all and I can't wait to see Garnet, Hollie, and maybe Dustin this weekend. By the way, if you guys are in Ft. Worth, give us a ring. We are having a slumber party Saturday night. I hope to hear from you soon. Love ya'.
