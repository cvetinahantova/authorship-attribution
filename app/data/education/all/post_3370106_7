Like the fool who listens then acts contrary to the truth of the words he has heard and builds his house upon sand, I too have had my foundation blown, washed, and eroded away right from underneath me.  I see this as good.  I can build again on rock.  Take action now to reinforce a solid foundation, take action that will instill an attitude of egoless service.  This will bring me joy.    I place all hope for my future endeavors in this world on the broad and accepting shoulders of the divine.  Mother, Father, Friend, our God make us ever one with thee...the wholeness I have sensed but always pulled away from, ran away from, deadened myself to...I realize now it is unescapable, one need not escape at all...but acceptance, humility, willingness to submit your own will to that of a higher calling...well, it only takes place through patient commitment to daily practice with energy focused on christ consciousness.  The eyes truly opened to the light of eternity.  Every cell awake and ready.
