Haha.. Half my weekend is gone already.. Here i am in school doing projects while i imagine my class mates snoring and sleeping blissfully in their beds till the late morning..Sobz..Life's never fair..  Sickening.. I can never understand what my Maec teacher is teaching.. Really think he's better suited in his old job..It's not that he cant teach.. Wait a min, he can't really teach!! It's just that whenever he's saying a concept, he'll pause for a moment and suddenly add in things.. As it is, Econs is so difficult to understand.. He's just making things worse.. He wouldn't have a problem teaching financial stuff given his background though..        --*.. Tip of the day: Love thyself..*--
