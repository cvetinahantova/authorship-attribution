I found my work from my first creative writing course during my sophomore year of college. Its content accurately represents some of what was inside my head during that period of my life. In retrospect, I have mixed feelings about the quality of these pieces. They have many nuances that I now perceive as flaws. Yet, they were really fun for me to write, as well as therapeutic, back then. I hope that the readers of these short compositions gain something from their bizarre content.
