i learned something new today. i was actually surfing on the 'recently downloaded' thing on blogger (there are some interesting stuff out there...) and i stumbled across one with one of my friend's name on. It was sorta funny, because just for a second i thought she started blogging too. well, obviously it turns out that she wasn't, and little did i know that her name was translated into something completely different. on a blog called "my aisling," her name was defined as, in gaelic/ irish as "vision, or dream." direct translation of this certain blog was "my vison/ my dream." and i thought my name meant something. goes to show that parents DO think about their kids' names not from the ring of it, neh? and in contrast, my parents named me "fast horse." my sir name is "big field," possibly changing to "tree village." either way, sounds very native american, don't you think?
