I decided to step outside for a walk because I just felt like I needed to go out somewhere. At first I wanted to see if Amir was around his pad, but apparently he wasn't... Decided to just keep walking, and heard 3 guys yelling out my name from a Pieter's old garage. My my, it was Jason, Cameron, and Christian... haven't seen them for a while. But it was still good to see them. I would've never have guessed that Jason had moved in Pieter's old house. Normally if I ever get bored, that's where I'd usually go -- to see Pieter. Anyway, I went up to the sausage-infested garage, grabbed a chair and chattered away with them.  It was fun... in fact, that's about the highlight of my week so far. Yeah, nothing better than having a discussion about sex and relationships with the guys again... heh.
