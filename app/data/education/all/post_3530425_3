I did it!  I've started a relationship with someone who doesn't make me feel neurotic.  He knows nothing about my depression or the medicines I take -- he just likes the wonderful, together woman I present myself to be.  And I  am  her.  Whether or not this turns out to be a long-term relationship, it feels healthy and wonderfully freeing.  A turning point for my relationship with men in general.
