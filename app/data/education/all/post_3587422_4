I would like to inform you that I am running for the freshman class president of 2004.  I am also proud to announce that I will teaming up with Kristin Manske as my vice president canidate.  I know that the rules say I can't make gurantees/promises but I still am.  I, Matt Giguere gurantee a party if Kristin and I win and a party at the end of the school year.  That's my promise, but that dosen't mean I won't have more parties.  Anyone who is supportive of these two canidates please see me, Matt Giguere, head of advertising to see how you can play your role in our '04-'05 campaign. Thank you and God Bless each and every one of you.
