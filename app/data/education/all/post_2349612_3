song in my head for the past 2 days:  Tommy played piano like a kid out in the rain  Then he lost his leg in Dallas  He was dancing with a train  They were all in love with dyin'  They were drinking from a fountain  That was pouring like an avalanche  Coming down the mountain   Some will die in hot pursuit  In fiery auto crashes  Some will die in hot pursuit  while sifting thru my ashes  Some will fall in love with life  and drink it from a fountain  that is pouring like an avalanche  coming down the mountain   I don't mind the sun sometimes  the images it shows  I can taste you on my lips  and smell you in my clothes  Cinammon and sugary  and softly spoken lies  You never know just how you look  through other peoples eyes
