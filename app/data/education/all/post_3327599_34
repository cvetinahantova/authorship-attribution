I like babysitting at my aunts house.. a little southern comfort from a bottle and a cowboy haha. Note to self: no pie and slow down... He was teasing me about my zippo so he supplied me with matches to help out my addiction. I really think i'm falling for him.. especially after this morning.. I made him french toast lol. And he better feel special cuz no one else got that kinda treatment. I'm exhausted tho. I'm having trouble with the drive it tires me out. We have yet to be on a real date tho.. We just hang out at his house or my aunts. My momma likes him which is big because she doesn't usually like any guys i date..:  "pothead", "controlling", "gay", "leprachaun", "overbearing"... and so on.. But with Chris i haven't heard one bad thing about him!   Anywho.. what else can i babble about? The dog's doin' better.. still a p.i.t.a. but she's too cute for me to be mad at. I need a nap.. or something.. speed.. not really jk. Anywho i'll probably get bored later and need something to do...
