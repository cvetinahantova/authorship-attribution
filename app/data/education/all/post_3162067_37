The internet offers access to a bizarre world. Take www.subservientchicken.com ; a bloke dressed up in a chicken costume doing whatever you ask him to do. Also there's a site called www.biddycam.com Both are excedingly bizarre. I love the internet. My favourite site at the moment is www.whowouldbuythat.com  which is just a collection of mad stuff found on ebay and other auction sites. Putting them here so that I remember them really. Today has been a really easy day at work. Year tens, then 20 minutes exam envigilation, then 1 hour free, then year 7s then...well, then that was it for the day. Pretty unusual though. Did have a mad panic when I came home though: a job application for a national trust job had finally arrived but the closing date was today! Phoned them up straight away and after being put on hold for 30 mins I got through to a very understanding lady who emailed me the job application form, and I completed it on-line. I hope I'm not prejudiced against because of a crappy postal system!
