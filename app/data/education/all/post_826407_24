I can see the world again!  I got a new pair of glasses on Friday and everything is clear and crisp again.  Its very exciting, altough I have been looking at my feet and being shocked how far away they are.  I celebrated my new vision by going to Froggart Edge with my friend Graham and enjoying seeing the views.  Later Friday evening I was walking back from Ben's house and noticed the light reflecting off cars and windows.  It felt as though I was walking in a photo.  Its interesting, like I take for granted what I see every day but the glasses have given me a new level of clarity and meant that I appreciate familiar sites anew.  Thank you for my sight God.
