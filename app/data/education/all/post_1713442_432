urlLink Schooling in Mexico: A Brief Guide for U.S. Educators. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by H. James McLaughlin.  It summarizes the educational system in Mexico.  From the ERIC Digest:  Mexican schools abide by federal policy and nationalized curriculum mandates. Each year since 1964, the federal government has provided free textbooks to every Mexican student in primary schools; students in grades 7-12 pay for their texts. Texts in grades 1-2 use the "global method," which combines social sciences and environmental studies. Throughout primary school the teachers and texts emphasize Spanish and mathematics, and also include geographic and ecological knowledge. Even in primary schools, Mexican texts include a straightforward, in-depth curriculum about health and human sexuality.    The grading scale in Mexico is commonly 1 to 10, and teachers give examinations 5 times a year in each grade. The tests must cover the national curriculum, but are developed locally. There is a national examination at the end of the school year. Students who score less than a 6 on the test are retained in the same grade level for the coming year.    Practical note. Mexican students coming from primary schools have not been ability grouped. This U.S. practice may confuse parents and students alike.
