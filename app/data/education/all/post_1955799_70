Hello,  I'm in class.  I like to take this time to reflect on the day.  It's soooo early.  I'm going to go home soon.  I may go to sleep.  While yesterday, I avoided caffine, I still didn't get much sleep.  That's a shame.  I need a latte.  It'll keep me awake. Turned in my homework assignment for today, which I did last night. Filled my car with gass today.  I spent $15.05, but it's full.  It should last me a week or so.  Eveybody else pays like much much more.  I guess their tank is huge.   Song of the Morning:     This Love   by Maroon 5.  Why:  I listened to it on the raido on my way to class.  It was a good song to drive to.
