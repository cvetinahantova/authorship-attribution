A Cruel Continuance   Last night I watched a new episode of  The Simpsons  for the first time in a couple years.  I am sorry to say that the same downward trend that made me stop watching that show is still in effect  (whatever  urlLink this guy  says now).    But I don't think the show sucks for the same reasons some more vocal television critics might.  Despite all the  urlLink jerk-ass Homer   theories  urlLink out there , Homer was always stupid.  The difference, then, is that in the earlier seasons, he was still human.  He was not guinea pig to a cheap and lazy postmodern slapstick.  He got himself in situations that, even if they were mundane, evoked recognizably human emotions  (Of course, I'm not suggesting that that show was legitimate drama, but that it was based in a loose realism).   The show’s symbiosis of sweetness and humor is what makes the golden years golden.   If the first season of  the Simpsons  tries to be sweet, but isn’t quite funny, the later seasons don’t even try to be sweet but aren’t funny either.  Another way to put it is that the writers no longer feel obliged to any sort of consistency.  They rely on the fact that they are a cartoon and that the jokes are limited only by what the artist’s can draw.  The result isn’t even Dadaist, it’s just bad prop comedy.  The jokes don’t add up to anything the way they used to, but each exists in its own vacuum of a desperate plea for laughs.  Even when it is occasionally funny, that’s all it is.  Satire is supposed to be more than that.  Homer, and the other characters for that matter, are only consistent across several episodes insofar as they have previously gotten laughs for being x or y, reducing each to the lowest common denominator of whatever they ever have been. The result is a caricature of a cartoon, if that’s possible, and it fucking sucks.
