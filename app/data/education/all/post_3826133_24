I had a job interview this morning.  It either went really well or it was horrible.  They were very nice and to the point and very congenial.  I either was perfect and they just have to figure out if they can afford me and if my hours will work.  Or they were rushing through to finish the interview because they hated me.  Bah.  Fucking Karen gave me a "discussion" when I got in today at one.  I need to get "organized" and learn to "cover my ass."  Bah.  Monkeypants is in Brownwood.  I miss him i miss him i miss him.  Hurry home, boyfriend.
