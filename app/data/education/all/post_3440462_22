According to  urlLink JK Rowling's website , the Half-blood Prince is neither Harry nor Voldemort.  We know that Harry is a pure-blood, but if it's not Voldemort, then who?  My money's on Hagrid, who is two half-bloods; giant and wizard.  I know it sounds weird, but it sounds weird enough to make sense in Rowling's world.  Or it may be a new character...  And, oh man, did I just tip my hand as a geek...  Though I only scored 26.4% on the test...
