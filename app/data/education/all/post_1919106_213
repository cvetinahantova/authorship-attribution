Shut down the internet, thrash your computer, because as of 5 minutes ago I stopped caring. You go out of your fucking way to make things fucking  easy  for them, and all you get is "Why doesn't this work like it used to". And when you try to explain them that it's because the system they're using right now is different from what they were using 5 years ago all you get is deaf ears and a dumb stare. From now on, I will stop trying to set things up like they want to and begin doing it like they should have it, and if they don't like it, then they can stick it where the sun don't shine, because I will not waste my time on unappreciated work.
