Oh the haps.  The keyboard I'm on really sucks.  I have to smash the "a" key to get it to work.  I guess there really isn't too much that happened this weekend of note.  I lost a lot at all sorts of drinking games on Saturday night.  Usually I can hold my own but it just wasn't meant to be.  My lack of sleep eventually caught up with me and I ended up at home fairly early by Saturday night standards.  We started with dinner at WABA.  Fenton's Parents joined us and it was a nice time.  I think we should eat dinner at seven every Saturday and make that a habit.  Doesn't always have to be WABA but if so that's cool too.  I dislike having to try and move around in large groups.  At some point I was at GR and it was a madhouse.   I love it when you find the perfect food to hit the spot.  This happened on Sunday when I went to the greatest little restaurant in Daegu to eat some soo-jae bee.  Wow this was some really good stuff.  I think GJ might be coming in town on Wed. night so I'm looking forward to hanging out then.  I miss going out on the week nights.  There seems to be nobody up for givener on weekdays.   I finally got a better memory card for my camera.  About damn time.  I've had it for 6 months and barely used it.  I've been waiting for my brother to mail me one like he said he would but looks like that never happened.   Work went rather quick today.   Saw The Passion of the Christ.  Pretty amazing movie.  I'm still out to lunch over some of the finer points but I have to say it was very powerful and moving.
