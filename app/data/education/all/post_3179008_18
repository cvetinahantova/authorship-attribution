We have a new student today. I read paperwork on this child a few months ago. Wow!! I don't say that much, but even the history of some of these kids continue to shock me, and slightly sicken.   We also had just gotten another student last week. Last week's student is 16 years old, history of assaultive behavior. He has a history of "crushing" on female staff, and students. He shined a little on Friday.  This week's student is 9 years old, and history of abuse... very scared... history of hidding under desks and in closets when people raise their voices.  Now we, our class, have the most widest mix of kids, and the widest age range of kids.  It should be very interesting. I have decided to take a different approach to my role in order to passively coerce other staff to work more toward their role. I have had a difficult time completing my paperwork job, which is probably my most important duty. My new idea could assit. Here we go....
