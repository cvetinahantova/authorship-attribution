I was just watching "50 First Dates" today by myself, after a series of problems during the morning of a supposedly "organized" get-together to part farewell to one of the greatest friends of mine, Adam. He called me up today to say he can't come, considering that, well, it was the last day before he was to leave for California, and I most likely wouldn't see him for another year. It was sorta depressing, but I guess in a sense it was sort of a "I hate goodbyes" kind of thing. I'll tell you one thing for sure, and that is, I sorta hate it as well.  So here I was, at home, deciding to call off the whole damn thing when all of a sudden, my mother conveniently decides to not pay her phone bills. Actually, the telephone company (imagine) FORGOT to give us the stupid phone bills so I was stuck not being able to CALL them. So, hell, what do I do? I just go, knowing that, after people told me that they still don't know if they were coming or not. And the plan was, that, well, they would  call me  under the circumstance they would or wouldn't. Guess I really couldn't know, so I went for myself. So what happened? No one actually came. Understandable.  The plan was that it would be a function from 2 - 6 p.m. at this mall, and we'd just 'go with the flow.' Well, it turns out, the flow was just plain ol' me, and I decided, that, with ten bucks, the cheapest way to spend it was just watching a couple of movies and burning out four hours of my life. It was pretty fun though... I'll tell you that. Well, hopefully, everyone else had fun doing whatever they did for that amount of time doing whatever, and hope no one'll hate me for the fact that, hey, I didn't answer my phone!  Awful quiet in my house though, minus my brother's temper tantrum... heh heh.
