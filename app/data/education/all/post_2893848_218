Cowboy Songs   My girlfriend just bought me the best record player $7 can buy and a slew of  urlLink Priest  and  urlLink Cowboy song  LPs from somebody's grandma.  Sure,  I just got a master's degree, but I don't deserve this woman.    I'm a little embarrassed to say that I haven't had a turntable since the one I had as a teenager broke.  (That's right, you hip fuckers:  smirk away.)  But I really dig how the process is just involved enough to make "listening to records" an activity in a way that "listening to cds" just isn't.  Convenience will sap the soul out of anything.
