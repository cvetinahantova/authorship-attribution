urlLink    I played hockey last night for the first time in 3.5 months, and surprisingly, I felt pretty good. Korean hockey is a much different than Canadian hockey...Most of the players are pretty decent skaters and they got skills but they lack the toughness that is common in a Canadian player. They also love to Cherry Pick (stand at the other teams blue line waiting for the puck to be passed for a possible breakaway) because Korean rules follow International rules, that exclude the red line. The cherry pickin' happens often, and it's pretty annoying but, oh well. There isn't many options for me to play hockey in Korea, so I'm thankful for being able to play. I got a new pair of hockey gloves, my last one's were completey done, so a buddy of mine here, brought these beauties back when he went to Canada for a few weeks.
