this post will be the last one before school starts tomorrow. at 10 pm i will be back at my room in boarding school, packing out my stuff and probably rushing through the very last bit of my holiday assignments...  i dont like boarding school that much but i have no choice, coz im a new student at acs...and btw i might stay again next year for my o levels...so good luck to me!  today my bro titus had his frenz over for a party, and they are still here as i type this out...i wonder when they will leave...  had my hair cut just now at parkway by sri nada or sth lidat...it wasnt too bad...considering it cost less than 10 bucks...anyway usually my mum cuts my hair...and the first time she experimented her hair-cutting skils on me it was a disaster! so im kinda afraid of her doing it now, but she still cuts all my siblings' hair...actually cozmy hair is so thick and it curls, it's really challenging for anybody to cut my hair well...so i guess cutting my hair is considered a handsome feat to perform!  wonderin' if i should go for training tomorrow morning...dono how tired i'll be after so long...anyway i think mebe not, might go for afternoon training instead, hope to be more active in swimming this term!  need to go now...hope to be able to post something this week...and o yes!...bottom line: this holiday sucked a lot! didnt go out...so much homework...yuck man!...gotta go...cya!
