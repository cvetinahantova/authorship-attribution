Well, another day passes, and my singular, driving urge is to go to Japan.  Julie asked me again today if I knew where I wanted to be in life, and I had to again admit that "I simply don't know."  I've never really had this problem before.  I've always had a couple of doors open to me, and usually have to pick one to go through.  Now however, I'm obsessed with the Japanese door, and for some odd reason no other door is appealing.  I guess the other thing that is weighing in on my mind is going back to school.  In this I really have only two options.  I could attempt my masters degree, which would be 12 months and expensive, or I could go back to school for computers.  Of these options the former is the less realistic one, as I don't have the money for a MA.  The latter is more realistic, but do I want to have two more years of schooling, two more years of debt, and two more years go by in my life?  Not really.  What I really want is to go to Japan, and work.  The pay is good (basically what I'd be making here as a starting teacher, but with less students).  I've always wanted to travel, I'm excited about seeing Japan and all it has to offer, and I think that it offers me an excellent chance to grow as a person.  The only setback to this is that I'm again putting all of my eggs into one basket.  Foolish?  Probably.  However, I still feel that over riding drive to do this, so I guess I'll keep trying until it either fails totally, or works out.  Until next time.
