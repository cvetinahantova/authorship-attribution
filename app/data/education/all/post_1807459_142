Well I think I'm done tinkering with the page for tonight.  Let me know what you think.  Caleb gives it a thumbs up.  Michelle your page doesn't seem to be working so I didn't link to it and Andy you never update so I didn't like to yours.  Let me know if this changes and I'll and links to you guys pages. "Dawn of the Dead" is pretty darn cool.  For the type of movie it was it was really pretty darn good.  I do wonder what a horror movie would be like if they didn't have stupid people making stupid decisions all the time.  Probably pretty boring.   Turns out one of the guys on my floor turned in his letter of resignation yesterday.  He is an older fellow named Robert.  Nice enough I guess but he is looking to do some serious teaching so he's at the wrong place.  He is annoyed that the Kims are letting him design and give out level tests.  They keep saying that they forget but that's probably bullshit.  Either way he's annoyed enough to up and leave so oh well.   Hold on while I try something else on my page.
