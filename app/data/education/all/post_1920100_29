Well I am writing because I found out about some Christian church near by my house. It is a latino based church. I am thinking of checking it out tomorrow with my mom. They are having a mother's day service in spanish. I think it would be good for her if she is up to it because if I take her to my church it is all in English and she really doesn't understand. I am still praying about this though because I do not know much about this church. Keep this in mind. If it doesn't work out I will just go to my church as usual. I will let you know what happens......
