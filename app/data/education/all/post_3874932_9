Maybe we need to think again about writing up themes.  It seems like a long time ago, but  urlLink I did write a section on technology optimism and self-efficacy .  I think curiosity/openness to learning, creativity and cosmopolitanism might be another one.  And, weren't we talking about a section on evangelism?  I don't have the emails we exchanged then because my inbox was corrupted and I lost everything.   Hmmm, we were also looking at life involvement or something like that, right? I suppose in terms of adoption and diffusion research life involvement would be akin to communications networks since more involved people have more communication and thus more options to hear about the advantages of the internet.   Someone might be interested in writing a methodology section.   In writing up technology and self-efficacy, I started with all of the output from NVIVO just on those themes and let the data suggest what I might say.  I can also run analyses of which themes co-occured together -- so, for instance, if you're working with creativity, I can see which other themes most often ocurred together with it.  Maybe as we write each section we will develop a model of how the constructs inter-relate.
