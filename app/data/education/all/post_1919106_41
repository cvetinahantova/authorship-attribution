Index   I was mirroring the Debian ftp server over the weekend. When I came in on monday, all I had downloaded was 3 GB of index files. Oh joy... NOT!   Space   Well, I finally got to mirroring the  real  debian package files, but the machine ran out of space. Fun stuff happens when a linux box runs out of space.   Blinky!   Yesterday we had fun in the lab by making the keyboard lights blink randomly and making the machines crash.
