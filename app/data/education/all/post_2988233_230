This morning, my sis took my dad to the doc, at the local VA hospital.  They just got home, it is 2:30pm, his appointment was at 7:30am.  Long day.  THey ruled out prostrate cancer, and bladder cancer, he has arthritis in his neck along with bone spurs, and arthur is in his knee too.  HE has to go for an MRI in September, but they want to do a CT scan before then to see if they can find anything before then.   His white blood count is too low as is is red blood count, so they thinkhe is bleeding somwhere, they just aren't sure where.  We should knwo more later today when the rest of his blood work is in.    ALl in all, he is a pretty healthy 84 year old.  Thank God.
