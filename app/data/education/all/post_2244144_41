ESPN, the same network that showed the Bobby Knight debauchery and a  urlLink show based on idiotic cliches ,  urlLink has deemed the slang word "lez" offensive . Being a good hearted citizen, I did not even know what the hell "lez" was refering to. So the article later refers to saying that it means lesbian (now I feel like a complete moron).  I am not that smart so I'll just refer to  urlLink George Carlin's seven dirty words .
