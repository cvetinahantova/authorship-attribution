Even though I am a Laker fan, the team really pisses me off in a lot of ways.  -Four future Hall-of-Famers, half of whom perpetually underachieve (Shaq and Payton). -Kobe's legal problems (he most likely won't go to jail, but could play somewhere else next season). -A fairly weak bench (compare their reserves to those of the Spurs, Kings, Mavs, Wolves). -Lots of attitude problems. -Team might enter rebuilding phase after this season (unknowns for off-season personnel decisions).  They were downright lazy until Game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Spurs and would not even be in the NBA Finals if not for divine intervention (the Derek Fisher buzzer-beater). In their defense, they have won 8 of their last 10 playoff games against tough opponents.  Now they have home-court advantage against the Detroit Pistons and will find some way to win the series, barring injuries or an extended period of ineptitude. Four rings in five years. Very nice!  Moreover, the Laker franchise (both Minneapolis and Los Angeles) has appeared in 48% of all NBA Finals and has won more championships than every other team in the league, minus the Boston Celtics. They are more dominant than the New York Yankees are in baseball.  Bottom line:  Relish Championship the Fourth under Phil Jackson. The future of the team will be desirable sooner or later.  Addendum: How did they lose game one so handily at Staples Center? They better up their intensity for the rest of the series or else I'm going to Vegas to bet against them in this series - since they're the favorites, I'd stand to make a nice chunk of change (an ever-decreasing chunk, however, as the Pistons win more games).
