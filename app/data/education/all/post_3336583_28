Today was Cora's Baptism. She looked so cute in her little white gown! I am Cora's godmother and Pam's dad is the godfather. Mass was interesting......a lot of standing, sitting, and kneeling.         Pam's mom cooked a ton of food, as usual. I don't think the woman knows how to cook "small".  She was  still  trying to feed me as I was getting up from the table! Of course I did not leave empty handed.  I took home a bag of homemade banana and apple muffins. Which, by the way, are very good. Pam made some of her famous fudge. I had a tiny bite and gave the rest to Brandon. It was good fudge, just way to rich for me.         I gave Pam and Brandon the scrapbook I made for Cora. They thought it was really nice. I also gave Cora two books - a baby Bible and a children's book about God.         Now I am back home and just finished working on grad school stuff. I am tired so I think I am going to head to bed and read a little of my Sting book......
