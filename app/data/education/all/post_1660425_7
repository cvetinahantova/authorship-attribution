I can't believe that the United States only has 39 percent of its school computers hooked up to the Internet.  Knowing that almost all of our computers at school are networked and Internet capable, I guess I feel sorry for those schools that do not have their school computers wired for the Internet.  Technology use around the globe has exploded and will continue to grow.  It will also bring us closer as a global community.  I find it interesting that other countries are starting to "catch up" to the U.S. in technology use and computer ratios.  We should take a closer look into continuing the push for technology integration in the United States education system.  The problem exists that states are responsible for education.  I think we will continue to see national legislation about education and the use of technology.  Education is a continually changing field and educators must be willing to change with the times.  Those changing times include the integration and use of technology in the classroom.  Teachers must be willing to commit to educating the next generation of Americans to be successful in their careers.  That committment will mean stretching the envelope and teaching new things in new ways.  BC  Additional Comments 6-14:  I looked at the charts for technology use by state.  I was pleased to see that Arkansas did NOT rank near the bottom in an education category!  As I looked at the Use of Technology statistics, I was impressed that AR 4th graders had one of the highest percentages of computer use once or more a week....BUT I then saw that that use was mainly drill and practice.  Drill and practice is good, but does not allow students all the benefits of using computers in the classroom.  I was suprised that more states do not require technology training for veteran teachers.  Only a handful, of which AR is a part, require such training.  Very interesting information from these charts.
