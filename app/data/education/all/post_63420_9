As the summer gets into full swing, I've decided to make a serious attempt to get (back) into decent running shape.   At the end of the month, the  urlLink BT50K , will take place in Brecksville, OH.  (Look for the blue blazes.)    This is the 11th running and the first as an actual "race".  I was the rd for the first ten years and it was more of a low key run.  Now, Vince and Steve from The  urlLink Vertical Runner  and Steve Godale have taken over, gotten permits from Cleveland Metroparks and the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and promise to take this run to the next level....whatever that is.  This represents a full relinquishing of my race directing responsibilities having handed over management of the  urlLink Mohican 100  last year.  I hope to start a new ultra race or two in the next couple of years.  Somewhere scenic and probably hilly.  Anyways, as I said earlier I also hope to get my own running career back on track, now that my classes at UAkron are just about done and I'm starting to get the idea that I may have some free time in the fall which I can use for training, racing, etc.  While I've been running marathons and 50K's for the last few years, they've been slow and I hope to both increase my distances and lower my times....
