I plan on using it to call people. Last night was crazy with the phone. Well, first of all, my parents called which is always a detailed conversation about what I'm up to and what work has been like and if I have a place yet and etc. So, I had one of those. Then, A. called to check up on me, talk about current job opportunities, and relay wedding plans for the upcoming week. Then, J. called to talk about school, discipline issues, and lesson plans. I liked talking to everyone, but I was about wore out! Heehee. I think it was just the mellowness of Chinese food and the Olympics that truly wore me out. That and the fact that I took the opportunity of watching the Olympics to pull out some crazy kung-fu moves on R. I don't think he appreciated being "chopped" across the arm or having me pummel his legs. I bruised my arm. I think it's some form of cosmic retribution for rough housing too much.  But anyway.....  I will call you if I haven't already, I promise!
