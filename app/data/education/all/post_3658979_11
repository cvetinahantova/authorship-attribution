Friends are wonderful.  Friends are amazing.  No matter who you are, you need friends.  They're there to lift you up when you are down, and to also knock you down a few pegs when you get too full of yourself.  They stick up for you when you are too weak, and they force you to stand up for yourself when you're just being a puss.  I don't know what I'd do without my friends.  I may only have a few, but those few I have are near and dear to my heart.  I LOVE YOU GUYS!  (You all know who you are.  Actually, hell.  Only one of ya reads this.  Oh well)  I couldn't get through life without you.  I mean that.  Know that you are loved.  No matter what.  And I don't care if this is cheesy.  I like it.  Even if I AM entirely awkward with this post right now.  =P
