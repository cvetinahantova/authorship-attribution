got tired of working at my desk, and straightened out the laptop, so it's working in front of the TV time again... despite our 70+ channels or whatever, there's absolutely nothing worth watching on... so movie time again... can you name the movie i'm watching for the first time in years from (1) the lyrics to the intro song, (2) a give-away quote near the beginning, and (3) a coffee quote a little farther in =P  (1) if only i could have a puppy, i'd call myself so very lucky just to have some company to share a cup of tea with me i take my puppy everywhere, la la la la, i wouldn't care; we'd stay away from crowds, besides that said no dogs allowed, oh we, i know he'd never bite me, we, i'd know he'd never bite me  if only i could have a friend, to stick with me until the end, and walk along beside the sea and share a moon with me; i take my friend most everywhere, la la la la, i wouldn't care, but we'll stay away from crowds, besides that said no friends allowed, oh we'd be so happy to be together, oh we'd be so happy to be together  but dreams are nothing more than wishes and a wish is just a dream, wish to come true...  (2) brinkley is my dog.  he loves the streets of new york as much as i do. although he likes to eat bits of pizza and bagels off the sidewalk and i prefer to buy them.  (3) the whole purpose of places like starbucks is for people with no decision making ability whatsoever to make 6 decisionss just to buy 1 cup of coffee.  short tall light dark decaf low-fat non-fat etc. so people who don't know what the hell they're doing or who on earth they are can for only $2.95 get not just a cup of coffee but an absolutely defining sense of self.  tall! decaf!! cappuccino!!!  yesterday's movie answer? "runaway bride"... yeah, laugh, i'm a girl... some days =P
