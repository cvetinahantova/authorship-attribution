We just watched 50 First Dates.  I bawled my eyes out.  I knwo, I know, nothing unusual there, but I actually liked the ending.    How sweet of him to make sure every day she falls in love with him all over again.  The divorce rate wouldn't be 2% if couples did that every day.  Both of them, man and woman, tried their dead level best to make their true love fall for them all over again.  Start each day anew, with a clean slate, and a fresh start.    Iliked the part when she told him she likes lilies.  But the part I liked the best was at the end, when she woke up, watched the tape, and saw her life with him.  Then walked outside to meet her daughter for the first time.  That, would be hard.  To meet your child for the first time every day.  But then again, it would be kind of nice to forget all those arguements, and troubles that kids create sometimes.    So, if you had to make someone fall in love with you all over again on a daily basis, how would you do it?
