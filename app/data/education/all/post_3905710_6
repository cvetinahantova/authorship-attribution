Woo tdy was national day celebrations day where we had amazing race AJ style Was pretty ok stuff... not the most thrilling race ever but what the hell... at least there was an attempt at creativity... Anyway class debrief was quite a moment where I kinda reflected upon my life in class 17/04... the fact is... 17/04 is split into 6 cliques... we have the multi racial "think we're so cool" girl power gang... the malay speaking gang, cheryl qianhui partnership, chinese speaking girl gang and of coz, the guy gang. Wait... I forgot, theres still the weird gals group..Today, mrs loh sorta told the class that we should not conform to just our cliques and try to be one as a class but somehow... I just dun really wan to be so close to the rest.. i mean its fine that we interact during class time but I just don see myself wanting to get close to some of these people... fine.... say that I have a superiority complex or wadever but I would like to choose my own friends thank you very much.... Of course, I will go to every class outing and wat so ever but please don ask me to be pally pally wif someone I don wish to be close to... it irks me Anyway.. off to happier stuff... went to eat after the celebration thingy wif the guys as well as dinah mayvina and hui xian at PS den later went to play pool wif the guys ( who else..) and huixian... Woo I think my pool's getting better... more confident now wif my shots but breaking still needs more training yup... after pooling decided it was way too early to head for HSH so we went to search for some coffee joint to sit down and tok cock Finally ended up at Taka Coffee Bean after fruitless search at paragon... vegetated there for like 1 hr? or sumthing b4 headin home.... Hope to have this kinda outing again man... wif more people....
