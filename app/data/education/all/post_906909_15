Farrell, G. M.‘  The changing face of virtual education: Introduction  ’   This text focused on the rationale and developmental patterns of virtual education (and all the other labels attached to it such as flexible learning, e-learning, and etc.). I found the points to be salient, though not quite foreign. There is definitely a need to maximise learning efficacy and with the advances in communications technology, it's not surprising to see educational institutions and other key players moving in step.   At this point though, I must reflect that there is very little said about effectiveness of technology. Although it has been shown that technology does little but to provide a communicable platform, I feel that the choice of learning platform and the way the learning objects or learning materials are presented can assist in the learning delivery.  I've also noticed that unlike more conventional learning approaches such as face-to-face instruction, virtual education seems more entwined with business goals. Maybe it is because of the immense costs involved. Virtual education is a massive investment although open source has enabled e-learning adoption across a wider scale.   Reading reflections so far have impressed upon me the importance of learning theories and instructional design, usually based on sound pedagogical approaches developed from face-to-face sessions. This strikes me as somewhat interesting as I would think that online learning will require a whole new set of pedagogies that may or may not have anything in relation to conventionally delivered education.
