urlLink Book Ninja   discusses  urlLink George Saunders .  This might not be new, but it's pretty great if you're into Saunders.    Within, Saunders's books are called "science fiction" shelved in bookstores with "straight" fiction.  Could this be the answer to my previous query?  Could be as simple as: if it is well-written enough, it isn't science fiction?
