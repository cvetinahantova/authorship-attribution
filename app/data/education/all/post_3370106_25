It is only within the intent to let divine energy propel and infuse my life that I find an outlet and a release from the glut of feelings that I would so love to indulge in.  But I've found that indulgence is violence at some level and whether directed inward, or outward will always remain unresolved.  So, indulgence is not an option, at least it never is for very long...please, indulge me for a little while, and we'll see how long the action can be tolerated.    And that is exactly the point! Tolerance and patience are so needed in every moment.  Does there ever come a time where these would not be wise?  Could there ever be enough of these in the world?  In our own lives?  Still, I become lost in desparate moments and spin the wheels of my mind on some delusion, thinking if I could just express this one more time, maybe then...but I am lost and disconnected.  Only be seeing from the inside through the spiritual center, through divine connection, feeling from the inside what vision really has to say about the outside, through the tongue, or pen.  But it must start from this place of surrender to infinite joy.
