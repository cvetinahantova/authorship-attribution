Ewwww I swallowed a bug while running 400s at track. That is why I am no sprinter. That is why I am the one and lonely 3200m chica.  THEATRE ARTS was so easy. We only had 35 multiple choice. I did my monologue, from "Good Night Desdemona" and it went pretty well. Don't mistake me, I would never want to be an actor, but I am pretty sure I got through that part with little or no scrapes. I only asked for "Line" once, and that was pretty good compared to some of the kids. Lindsay kicked ass though on hers. Spencer did well, too. I hated the essay...it was rather silly.  Spanish was a breeze.   Today I had the Algebra one, which wasn't too terribly hard. I didn't like it, though. It wasn't much fun.   The Biology exam was stupid. I finished so early and then we could only read or sleep, and I had no book so I snoozed and it was the most uncomfortable manner in which to sleep. I am surprised I slept at all.  Tomorrow I have no morning exam, and then for second period B-day exam I have Team Sports. Shouldn't be too hard.  SCHOOL IS ALMOST OVER!!! YESSSSS!
