First, well actually my second day of school. Pretty long day of ten hours listening to you're teachers and you're new classmates chattering to each other if not to you. Got over ten subjects, and I just finished a few of my assignment. I actually got lost at the LRT today as I was going home. I got a station farther from where I was supposed to be. Well, got more things to do to the web so see yah! : )
