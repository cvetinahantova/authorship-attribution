Today was tough for me. As most of you know Craig and I are trying to get pregnant.  I was supposed to start my period yesterday... but there is no telling what my cycle will be like off the pill.  (this is the first month off). I took a test this morning and it came back negative.  Now before you give me the whole, it is just the first month, don't worry, you will get pregnant, keep your hopes up speech... please know that I know all of these things.  I can tell myself that.  But, it didnt help the disappointment I felt.  I cried most of the morning...  I guess I just this one thing to go easily for me.  no big rigamarole.. no hoops, ovulation kits, etc.  such is life for me.  I am feeling better now and much more on top of my emotions. s but it was a tough first half of the day.  I spent most of it painting and thinking... so, that out of the way.  here is the food report: bf- coffee (splenda) 0     pickle  0  (craig had to go to the stsore.. there was nothing low point ot eat.. so a pickle was it.      bowl of cereal with ff milk.  5      cup of grapes 1 (slept in... so, no lunch) dinner- chicken nuggests and french fries.  chicken nuggets are a shit ton of points... but i stayed within reason...  had ff ketsup and ff barbeque sauce.  total points 23  water=5  soda=none xrsize= does crying count.. guess not.  (good try though, right?)  overall day (must change my rating scale so that 10 is the highest=oprah.. 1 begin fatty fatty booblatty=goodyear blimp)  8
