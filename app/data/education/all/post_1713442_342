urlLink Memory Alpha  This is an encyclopedia of the  Star Trek  universe. It is based on the same software and model as  urlLink Wikipedia . That means that anyone at any time can come along and add new articles and revise current ones.  This project is nicely done and I am sure it is one of the best Trek reference sources out there.  (I looked at some of the talk pages and noted heated discussions of what is and is not "official" canon.  It is all fiction but what fiction is gospel and makes the encyclopedia!)  A couple of articles I looked at:   urlLink Klingon   urlLink James T. Kirk   urlLink USS Voyager   urlLink Earth   urlLink New Zealand
