A break from it all...the norm...    Â  I guess I write a lot on this msg board and as far as I know, only the few people I know well read this, but yet at times I wonder if there are things I want to share on here for everyone to read. I mean, I feel that being anonymous and writing something is much better than writing it with my name stamped on it. As far as we all may say we don't judge, we DO! and it's solely on a persons' name. I figure that's the reason I will start yet another msg board to share a few things. I guess that way people can write to my anonymous address.
