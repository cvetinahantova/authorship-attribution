For everyone to know... Sometimes the blog becomes screwy and problems happen.  It becomes hard to tell if your comment actually made it onto the blog.  I read Spencer's comments, and he had three of them that all said the same thing.  I promise you that I wouldn't take someone's right to post something on this page away from them.  But just because they were all the same, I removed two of the three.    Sorry Barbie...
