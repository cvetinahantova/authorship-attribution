It's really amazing how the relationship between two people could blossom so fast in one night.  Teka, I don't think 'amazing' is the right adjective to describe what happened last night.  'Precipitous' would be a more apt description.  Cuz last night, the relationship between me and a close female friend of mine went beyond the common 'friend' level.  It wasn't planned, it wasn't choreographed.  It wasn't manufactured.  It just happened.  As to WHAT exactly happened, I'll just keep it to myself.  That information involves something more than me so I'm not free to post that here.  Syempre kung ako lang yun, it would be a different matter.  Let me just say that it started with me inviting her out to dinner and ended with us bumming in my car by a road near Xavier.  Yun na yun.  Grabe nga eh.  Until now 8 hours and a sleep after, I'm still in a shell-shocked mode.  May mass kami ngayon pero nothing registers.  Di naman dahil that is the first time I've went out with a girl (fyi: it's not).  But I really can't believe that happened to us.  Lagi na lang sumusulpot sa vocabulary ko ngayon the words:  'an unlikely pair'.  But I know that I have to stop it from progressing.  Hindi kasi mangyayari na maging Kami eh.  I don't want to drag her into an emotional rollercoaster just for my sake.  Ayaw ko syang masaktan.  I care about her that much.  Pasensya na rin pag walang photo.  Promise I'll post it here someday (if I can get one that is).
