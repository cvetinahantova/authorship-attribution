On the Job Front!       Well, over the past couple weeks I have been receiving emails from all over Europe.  Emails have come from Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, the U.K., Sweden, Norway, and Finland.  Why you might ask?!?!?!    Basically, I have now decided that from Japan I hope to move to Europe for maybe 6 months and see as much as I can in that time period.  While the Jet Program does pay very well, I have to have some type of income or some way of saving money to afford the travelling.  Currently I am receiving emails from all types of families with children of all ages asking for and offering different things.  Right now my top choice is a family that goes back and forth between Spain and Switzerland.  They have a live-in babysitter and live in domestic-help so all they would want me to do is help the kids with English when they are not in school, hang out with them, and drive them places.  In exchange I would receive free room and board, a monthly stipend, access to their car, would get to travel with them for free, and experience a little bit of life in Europe.  Not too bad I suppose...   I will definitely keep you updated as I narrow my search and ultimately determine where I will be heading next.  Don`t worry...I will definitely return to the US for a few weeks before I relocate abroad!
