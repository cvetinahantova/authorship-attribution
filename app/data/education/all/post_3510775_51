urlLink     Hey, I know.  Let's dive in.  Let's scour the world.  Let's learn to program Python.  Tell me about the Tao of modern society.  Computer zen?  Go logoff.  Let's learn all about syntax, and runtimes, and semantics, and tokens, and variables, and strings.  Deep mode.  It is not a crime, silly cracker.  I'll focus my morning... day... evening.  I'm getting calls from upstate, Georgia, Michigan.  I'm going high-level.  I look down, and all I see is pure putty in my hands.  Only it's my will that's doing the talking now, pilgrim. I'm bending spoons.
