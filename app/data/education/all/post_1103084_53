on the way home tonight from Uncle Larry & Aunt Sally's Annual Square Dance (formerly the Leindecker holiday / event of the year -- surpassing even Christmas (I hypothesize its ability to articulate a symbolic grammar of nostalgia for farm life is the reason) some years -- this year just a good ol' time, less of a family time, possibly because of Grandma Cory's "passing."), Jaelyn and Addison had a little squabble so I turned around and told them a version of the story / interaction b/n Jesus & Andrew about how ongoing forgiveness must be...how living Jesus' teachings is HARDEST with our brothers.  JAELYN: Did they have sisters?  ADDISON: More!  Tell more.   JAELYN: Tell a story about their sisters, Daddy.  ME: Not sure that they had any sisters.  it's not really clear. [andrew resists the urge to here insert an editorial regarding feminist criticism of the biblical narrative.]  ADDISON: More!  Sisters, JayJay!  JAELYN: Yeah, Dad.  Tell a story about their sister, Jaelyn.  Of course this is all happening with lines over top of each other, so I'm still deciding on my response, when Jaelyn  intervened.  JAELYN:  "And their sister, Jaelyn, was talking to Jesus, and all of the sudden a SNAKE came up and wrapped around her leg.  Jesus took a knife and he CUT the snake.  He cut off its head.  He cut off its tail.  He cut all the parts of it."  Maybe I'm rearing a prophetess, because the way that she wound the Eden / serpent / He shall crush your head, you shall bruise his heel / Eve - Lillith imagery together was really quite impressive.  Anyone ready to name Jaelyn the next Ellen White or Joseph Smith...?  Hope your weekend included some...  peace~
