I'm calling this blog "Why I Wish My Car Was More Like a Mac Than a PC"   Have you noticed the amazing number of computer magazines that exist?  Well, I spend my time stripping covers off of old magazines at work, so I always take the time to peruse them.  Without fail, all of the PC magazines have articles like "What to do when Windows crashes again" or "How to protect your computer from all those awful PC viruses."  On the other hand, Mac magazines have fun articles about how you can use your super-wonderful-awesome-aesthetic Mac to do all sorts of great things.  I am a Mac user of one year, and I love my computer....no, worship is more the right word...and I'm not a technology person.  My computer is beautiful...his name is Max :)  My car, however, is more like a ruddy PC that likes to break and wreck my plans and cost me money.  Boooooooooooooo I say to my car.  this is a horrible blog, but the point is that I love my computer and hate my car.  If only I didn't need my car to get to work so that I could afford my computer.  Again, boooooooooooooooooooo I say!  Booooooooooo!
