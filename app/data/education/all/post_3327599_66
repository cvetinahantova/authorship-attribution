that picture thing made me crazy.. anyway!   i'm in kansas to visit family. tomorrow my cuzin Heather will be up and we're gonna cruise around and pick up guys haha! i haven't gotten to scope out Pittsburg boys yet. hopefully they're better then Jenks boys. i'm starting to think i have a one track mind.. boys boys and more boys.. oh well. so it sounds like i might be spending more time at fun house.. Sheila introduced me to this guy and he seems like he'd be awesome to hang out with. but probably not monday.. cuz i think i have a date that night.. i really don't think i want a bf right now. i'm tired of getting hurt and stalked.. speaking of stalkers i haven't heard from Brandon since wednesday night! maybe he gave up.. but then again he's in arkansas so maybe he'll start up again when he gets back..
