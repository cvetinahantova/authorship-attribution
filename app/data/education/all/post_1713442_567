urlLink The Preparation and Professional Development of Teachers of English Language Learners. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Beth Antunez.  From the ERIC Digest:  The population of school-aged English language learners (ELLs) has consistently and significantly increased over the past decade, transforming America's public schools, the instruction of its students, and the preparation of its teachers. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 requires there be a "highly qualified" teacher in every classroom by the end of 2005, and school districts and teacher preparation institutions across the nation face the challenge of preparing and hiring large numbers of teachers while retaining a focus on quality. This digest will discuss the need for increasing the numbers of teachers of ELLs and the particular linguistic and academic characteristics of ELLs.
