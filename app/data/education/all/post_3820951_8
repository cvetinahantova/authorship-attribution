hi kel. it's evitz here. i just want you to know that i'm very thankful you trusted me enough to let me know your other blogspot add. it meant a lot to me. i hope i don't ever do anything to screw up that trust because i really value it. why? because you've made, and still continue to make, me think and rethink things i wouldn't have given a thought to had you not pointed them out to me (consciously or unconsciously). thanks for letting me into your world (as you also know that you are welcome into mine anytime you feel like peeking into it...) so there...thank you so much.   that was the message i sent to kel this morning thanking him for opening up to me...i really value the intellectual converstaions we manage to have between us every morning!
