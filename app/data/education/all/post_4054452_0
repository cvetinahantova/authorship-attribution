1. Frustrated that my summer class is not over yet 2. Frustrated that I finished my project for said summer class, but am feeling uneasy about it---but not because I don't think I did a good job, because I think I did TOO good a job, if that's possible 3. Frustrated that a friend is making a big mistake and I can't do anything about it 4. Frustrated that I'm so busy finishing up my class and planning my vacation that I amd having trouble finding time to spend with said friend who is making said mistake 5. MOSTLY frustrated that I'm tired and can't fall asleep at night or during the day to take a nap
