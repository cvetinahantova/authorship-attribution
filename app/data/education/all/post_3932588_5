Hi Everyone,        Just wanted to send support and energy from the east coast. I am doing my runs out here, but, the heat and humidity has not made it easy.       I will be running with you in spirit tomorrow morning, I will do mine, but, will miss the company of all of you.   I know everyone will do well, as a group there is nothing we can't handle, that is so powerful...                                                                                                                  Suzanne
