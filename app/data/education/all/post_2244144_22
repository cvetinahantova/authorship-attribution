9/11 Commission: "We believe we are safer. But we are not safe."  Ben Franklin: "Those who sacrifice liberty to become more secure, lose both liberty and security."  What I have been wondering is if anyone actually believes they are more secure than they were before 9/11.  Take for example if you were walking down a crowded street and you saw some Arab looking people. In our current society (in USA at least) we (as in the caucasian majority) probably will label these people as terrorists simply on their stereotype.  And of course the government is not trying to help us. With the current color scheme of terrorist threat they always warn us of looking out for suspiscious looking people. So what pops up into our heads? A Muslim male with a beard and a towel on his head.  Of course the other alternative when we see such a group is to do everyone's horrid impression of the Apu character on the Simpsons.  It is no wonder why they hate us.  So what does all of this have to do with security? Well by doing this we are making millions upon millions of people hate us more. Does hate make us more secure? I did not think so either.  Then there is the civil liberties we have given up just to "protect" us. I could go on and on about these, and maybe I will on a future date, but simply the gain (if there is any) far outways the negatives.  So let me ask you one more time, do you feel more secure now than before? I definately do not. In fact, I feel less and less secure under the current methologally of making us more "secure".
