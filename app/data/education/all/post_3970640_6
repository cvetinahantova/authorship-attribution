Garth Brooks once sang "sometimes I thank God, for unanswered prayers"… at times I wonder why anyone would think that way.  There have been instances when I believed this fully. Sometimes it is best to not get what we pray for. Everything happens for a reason. We don't know the  master plan . And then there are times when I feel like screaming "I don't give a d*mn about the reason! Make it work out NOW!"  I've definitely had a lot of those times in my life...  What I've discovered is that no matter how much I want something to work out, if it is not meant to be, it just plain won't happen. Is that a good thing? I honestly don't know any more. It may be part of a master plan, but it certainly isn't always fair.
