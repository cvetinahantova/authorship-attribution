i don't understand why dogs feel the need to chase their tails. do they forget they are back there? i don't get why my dog chases it until she gets ahold of it and pulls on it until she makes herself fall over...   i need to get my senior pics done.. i haven't even made an appointment yet. is that bad? dude you got a dart in your neck.. is that bad? speaking of that i haven't seen Angel in awhile.. we should do something this weekend. i think i'm going to bells on sat. for my aunts company picnic.. as of right now it's her and my family so if anyone gets too bored i suppose i will allow you to hang out with me..   yes it's true.. i'm a stalker.. but i learned from the best!
