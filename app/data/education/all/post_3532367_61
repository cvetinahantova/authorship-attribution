Well, having travelled just over 100 miles it looks as though our man is interested in the bike. After a bit of haggling we agreed on a price and he has just phoned to say his bank will have the money ready for him on Saturday - yipee! Fingers crossed it all goes through OK.  Have been getting headaches today, something I dont usually get. I think I had one last night when I went to bed too. I feel tired now, but that is probably due to riding all afternoon - lets hope I manage to get some sleep.
