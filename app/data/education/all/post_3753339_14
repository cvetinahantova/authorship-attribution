No one's around, nothing's open, and the total lack of tactile contact with my species is starting to get on my nerves--ugh!  Nothing is updated--oh well, at least the heat isn't keeping me from anything.  On the other hand,  urlLink K is staying , hurrah, hurrah!  I love that man sooooooo much.    I also have to amend a comment I made yesterday.  While the day was physically boring, I did make some major strides in my dissertation and my fiction writing, and I came up with a felicitous way to describe life in RTP.  The day was by no means a total loss.  --Varenia
