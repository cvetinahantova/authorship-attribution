Gaming news   Yesterday we finalized most of our characters for Jeff's game. He got each of us some fancy magic items (I got a  necklace of fireballs  - my dwarven fighter/mage is going to have  so  much fun! :] ) and I wrote him a 5-page background for my character - aye, I was on a writing spree. And I found some nifty spells that have no somatic components and are thus not subject to arcane spell failure due to wearing armor. I still need to look up on the cantrips though... I'll probably wear armor until I get a chance to get my 4th character level, and then pick up  Mage Armor  (the 3rd character level will most likely Fighter, so that I can pick up an extra feat) and drop the physical armor, which will also get rid of the check penalty. One thing I'm wondering though is whether I should change the greatsword for a one-handed weapon and get a shield instead. I could swap DEX with WIS on my character and get that extra will saving throw. Worst case I'll do the kamikaze attack and run to the front lines and drop the necklace at me feet... "BANZAI!!!!"
