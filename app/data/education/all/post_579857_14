Greetings in the name of Jesus!  why should i convince you to see it? are you gonna have the same convictions from God after seeing it? maybe, maybe not, dont read on. just go see it! enough said.  soldiers in Christ, "Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes." Ephesians 6:11...another way to look at it, superheros in Christ, embrace your supernatural powers "of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes."  my revolution...how clear the picture of the Christan fight comic book writers create! what other reason is there for "supernatural beings" to have flaws? Christians are in a supernatural battle 24/7. though we have flaws, we have an awesome God in which to trust. our powers are not of ourselves, but a gift that can only come from God.  according to Ben Parker, "With great power comes great responsibility." the woman behind the man, Aunt May, reminds us by always keeping Peter/Spider-man grounded. there's more, but it's so late already.  By His grace and mercy, Gill
