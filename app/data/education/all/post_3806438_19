The Mets limped into the all-star break today with a loss to the Marlins.  They've played well this year against the Phillies, but can't seem to get past the Marlins for whatever reason.  Even though they're currently in fourth place in the division, they're only 2 games out of first place.  As much as I'd love to see them win that division, I think everyone is too bunched together for the Mets to rise out of that division.  Hopefully they'll make a trade before the deadline.  The Yankees, on the other hand, swept the Devil Rays heading into the break and are currently  7 games ahead of the Red Sox in their division.  They'll win that easy, but they've still got to shore up their rotation.  El Duque pitched relatively well today, so that's good, but he'll need to do that consistently. Kevin Brown needs to get healthy, Mussina needs to be out there, Vazquez has to stop giving up home runs, because he's brilliant otherwise, Lieber needs to be consistent, as does Contreras.  They need to cut Felix Heredia, because I would be a better left-handed option out of the bullpen at this point.  If the Yankees don't win the world series this year, it will be because of their pitching.
