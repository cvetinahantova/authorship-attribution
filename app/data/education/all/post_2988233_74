I just have to say I was totally and completely shocked by tonights American Idol.  Why on earth was Jennifer Hudson voted off???????  You could tell the other contestants were shocked as well.  I honestly thought George Huff was going to bawl his eyes out.  I mean it was bad.    And how on earth did Latonya and Fantasia get in the bottom 3 as well?  That was just bad.  If one of those two don't win, I will never watch the show again.  The producers need to do something about the voting system, that is all there is to it.
