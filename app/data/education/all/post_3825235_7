So, today I went to see  urlLink Spidey 2 !  It was cool.   Although some of it was unrealistic (destroying a fusion reaction of that magnitude by just throwing it into a river??? I mean, come on...), I truly enjoyed seeing it...  Even though I still haven't seen part 1...:)  Yet another time I saw part 2 before part 1...am I making this a trend? (And for those of you who are interested, I saw  urlLink Two Towers  before The Fellowship of The Ring...  Oh, and I saw parts 1 and 3 of  urlLink Harry Potter , but have yet to see part 2.  Hehe)   I would like to see  urlLink I, Robot ...heh, yeah...only because of Will Smith.  I have heard mixed reviews, but I heard someone say today that it was better than Spidey!  I have to check it out.  (I did see  urlLink Wild Wild West  in the theater...the cheesiest movie he has been in, but I am a FAN, man!)   And  I decided I would be interested in seeing  urlLink Catwoman .  Yeah, I wasn't sure of it at first, because I thought it would be dumb, but the preview before Spidey told more of the story behind her cat-woman-ness, and I thought it sounded interesting.   Still can't wait to see The Incredibles... Someone  got me hooked on Pixar with his wild ambitions...crazy boys!  But, that's not until November...darn...so much is still to happen before then.  Oh, well.  By the time it does come out, maybe I'll need a break from school.   Speaking of looking forward to things,  urlLink Nickelback  and  urlLink Puddle of Mudd  are having a concert the day school starts, and I am so STOKED!  Cool cat.  Ok, that's the end of my commercial for now.  It's time to put my soap-box away and get in bed.  Let me know what you are waiting for...you know, movie-wise.
