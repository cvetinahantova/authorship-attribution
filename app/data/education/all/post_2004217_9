Ha! On the annoying Search bar that appeared on my browser when I downloaded MSG+ there is a link to "Foot sex". How intriguing...  My dad posted me some obituaries today. He got my flat number right, the flat block number right, the town right, the county right, but missed out the postcode and wrote HARBORN road instead of CAMBORNE! It's a little more than disconcerting when your own father doesn't know where you live. Granted, I can never remember whether his home phone number starts 724.. or 274... but come on! Harborn?? Good Grief.  2 irritating DRAPER-related things today: First: I got my ticket for the halloween party, and on the back is written "Jess King (Uter)" Apparently "Uter" is written to distinguish me from Jess May who is also coming tonight. Because obviously my SURNAME doesn't distinguish me from her...!! Second: text "from" Draper this afternoon: "i love u". Ha! Turns out Chris Devy sent it. I am less bothered by this, in fact it's kinda funny, but I still wish people would just leave me alone :o(  The search bar now says "Sex girls"... don't think I'll be clicking anywhere near that any time soon...  Ceff x   Reception less than warm...
