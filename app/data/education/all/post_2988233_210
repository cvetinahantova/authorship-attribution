Every Friday, (used to be saturday) Tommy and myself play poker with Stan and Renee and sometimes Renee's sister Tiffany.    Last week was a disaster.  Tommy was in a pertubed mood, and hurt my feelings early on in the night.  So then I showed my Butt and pouted all night.  Then he got mad at me because I was a butt to him.  see how things just keep going on and on in circles?  Tonight I am looking forward to it.  We are starting some new rules, mainly to see if we can actually finish a game with out a time limit, or having to go all in on the last hand before the time limit.    TOmmy won the first 3 weeks, last week he lost by timelimit.  We need to kick his tail, and I need to quit going all in so early because I am tired and want to go home to bed.  I jsut wind up being permenant dealer, for the next 2.5hours while the 3 of them play.    Not much fun being perm. dealer.
