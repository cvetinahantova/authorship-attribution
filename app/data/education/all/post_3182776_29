The queue for the bathroom is long and winding.  There was once a time when I could get up at nine on a Saturday and comfortably expect three hours of peace and quiet before any of my various housemates dragged their sorry carcasses up to bother me. Not so now. This morning all manner of lodgers and scroungers are here and all of them are between me and a nice hot bath.   I feel so dirty. I have to get dressed and go into town. I have to buy educational literature and start an essay about Gifted and Talented children, supported by 'considerable school-based research' of which I have done none.  GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM BEFORE I RITUALLY DISEMBOWEL YOU!  *Makes them all a nice cup of tea*
