Hey welcome folks, so i've come around and have decided to have another outlet for my own personal developement.  I want to think out loud in this site with the added benefit of possibly getting feedback from friends and strangers.  I probably won't be posting to much very personal information, I try and use other not so self-voyeuristic means to communicate whats happening in my life to my friends. Of course my website on sourceofhope.com/joe has plenty of background information on me and what I'm doing if your interested.  Anything you don't want on this site feel free to email me, and i'd be gratefull, and will happily reply.  My attention is not costly, I am willing to learn how to pray for anyone, and give advice those times when I may have some.  I'm happy that you came to this blog, and hope you enjoy it and are challenged and built up by it somehow.  I am praying for those who read it, that they might be encouraged, and this little light of mine might shine on another side of the world wide web.
