WOW!! I didn't realize it had been so long since I last wrote.  I have been busy busy busy!!  Independence Day has come and gone, I had friends over, we  B-B-Qed which was kinda odd being that Kristin is a Vegan.  Apparently veggies do quite well on the barbie.  I started student teaching last Wednesday.  I am at Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills and I like it!! I got some pretty colorful kids! Honestly they really are great.  All of them speak English (Strange for a California public school!!!) and they really are bright!  I think they failed last semester (this IS summer school!) mostly because they didn't do their work.  I think I'm going to grade class work higher than actual homework!  I haven't taken over the class yet, I do that Tuesday and start my own lesson plans on Wednesday, which will be really nerve wracking due to the fact that my University Supervisor has decided to come down on Wednesday as well! I'm nervous and TERRIFIED of that!! In the mean time I have introduced new memebers to my managerie.  Which is what my room is becoming.  I had some trouble with my turtle/fish tank leaking, so I got a new one (they're 10 bucks, I can't complain) so I got 3 Hermit Crabs to occupy the old tank (which is fine, it just can't hold 10 gallons of water anymore).  Rob's parents gave them a small (maybe one gallon)fish tank which they had no use for and gave to me.  I've put a Betta Fish (Siamese fighting fish) in it. So WELCOME Harry, Ron and Hermione Crabs! and Basil Betta!! I went by and saw Pippin last night, he's getting big and still SOOOO adorable!!! She should be comming home in a few weeks (we think both the baby bunnies are girls, but we're not sure yet). So that is life the universe and everything from this point. I've spent my weekend writing lesson plans, brushing up on the Columbian Exchange, writing a paper on Accountablitiy in the No Child Left Behind Act (SO FRUSTRATING!!!) and watching Fawlty Towers! I SO love John Cleese!!!
