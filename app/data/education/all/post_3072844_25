Whooo hoo had a great time last night.  My waltzing has improved due to james' coaching.   I am sure i had my drink spiked i felt soooo like lively until i got in the car and fell asleep on Joe.   Neva mind I am now back in latin lessons and i hate this.  It sux sooo badly.   Any way the bbq in the first weekend sounds ok tho i actually havn't checked my calender so i don't know.   OH YEAH! I remember umm i can get a ticket for greenbelt at Â£30 from my mate hu now can't go! WHOPPEEEEE! Also i need to talk to hannah about the dweeb gig and see if i can get a lift there.  Then i need to get in touch with becci and ed and see if they wanna go into town sumtime and go see a movie.  That would be fun.  Ed was really evil last night talking about stroking the shrubbery cos it was soft only using it as an excuse to get around me to distract becci.  Ahh well i better go and get on with finding out my exam results  Taraaa  Gracie mwha xxx
