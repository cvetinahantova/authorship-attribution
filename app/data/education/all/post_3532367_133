That's me! It's official!  I was having a good day today - work was OK, I was feeling good. Even had some messages off Angela.....but then I got home to two letters.  The first one (off the counsellor) said she was really concerned about me telling her of the knife incident, she had discussed it with the doctor and was strongly advised to contact the mental health team for a more urgent referral. Well that made me feel really good didn't it!  The second one (off the mortgage company) said that they refuse to cover me on any life policy until the outcome of any medical investiagtions, and will only cover Sandra. Basically they have labelled me as too high a risk to insure - very very scary! So even if I wanted to kill myself now I can't and if I die by accident my kids suffer - great!
