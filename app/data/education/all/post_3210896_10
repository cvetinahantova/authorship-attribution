My life...that's all it is. Nothing more, nothing less.  Frankly, I can't understand why anyone would care. Well, I know my wife cares...she's my wife and all. There are other family members who might care as well. You know, the occasional baby picture, a funny story here and there, and it's all gravy.  For those of you who aren't family, I just want to say "Hey, thanks!" for stopping by. I can't promise you any sort of entertainment, but hey...it's my life.
