BIG MOUTH   Well looks like I've really done it this time. I've gone and said something I shouldn't have and now Tonya (and friends) are pissed off at me.  Well I'd just like to say no one told me it was a big secret. No one told me that this was to stay behind closed doors. No one told me it was on a need to know basis.  Yes, I did not think before I spoke, but come on! This was like 20 minutes after I had found out. I never expected anything like this to occur. Even then I was still in doubt. I shouldn't have reacted the way I did, but it's over now.  Anyway, I've learnt my lesson. Ash asked me about it twice (once joking, then later seriously) and I didn't tell her either time. I'm like a pet: at first I piddle on the carpet but if you just give me a chance I'll learn to use the kitty-litter tray.  What's done is done, let's just hope we can move on from here.  (Chem test was crap, 92% for Thursday's Intro Calc test bringing overall to 91.6%)
