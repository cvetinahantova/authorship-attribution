Let me tell ya about what came out of my mouth earlier when Abbie was in the bathtub...   "I'm dabba-dabba-ing, so stay still!"   Wouldn't my future employer enjoy hearing me talk like that!  And you only thought I was kidding about losing my vocabulary in that paragraph above.  Oh, ye Doubting Thomas!  To combat my loss of vocab, I have been taking part in the daily crossword(s) at work.  There are 5 or 6 of us who take part, and it has been fun learning the many ways they try to trick you in those hints.  "You gotta be quick with me...I'm from Eerie, P.A.!"  Some rather bothering news:   urlLink Here  is a story about part of my family...it is just not right.  I'm not going to even begin to say how much certain things in that news clip upset me...only to say this:  Abbie will NOT be attending Mitzi Bond elementary, and that Texas has lost out on one extraordinary former future teacher.  (I was planning on being an engineer for a while, and then as Abbie grew, I was going to become a teacher so I could be there for her when she needed me.  Well, not no mo'e!)  That's that!
