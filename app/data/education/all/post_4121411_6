Yawn.... Today is really a tiring day. Went to pick up Pastor David Wallace in the morning at 630 am. Attended both services, rushed home and change so that I can make it back to church in time to help in the children's church for the Ed Silvoso meeting. Once again, I missed out on a great meeting. Somehow I got used to it already. I'm pretty much down for the children when there is a meeting going on..but things look to be changing with the forming of the special task force who will help to look after the children during the special meetings. We went for dinner after the meeting with Boaz and family. But we saw the rest of the deacons at the chicken rice stall too..haha...had a big chicken feast... Had to send Boaz back after that. I drove all the way to Pasir Ris  then back to Eileen's palce because I asked her to be with me even though she hinted that she was tired. Felt really bad after that. Am I taking her for granted??? I just want to spend more time with her before she goes back. She shared that she had bad experiences before and was afraid to commit herself fully to this relationship, but God convicted her of it. Praise God that things are working out really well between us... yawn...
