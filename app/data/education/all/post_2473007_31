He was an outcast with a doomed directive.  His cries would go unheeded and his tears would fall unnoticed.  The only comfort Jeremiah could find in this life was the assurance that he was right, and the only protection he knew was in the arms of God.  He forsook the world to embrace the message of God and gave up all earthly value to do so.   Poor trade?  Looking through eyes still doubt-blinded, perhaps.  Some clay, spittle and faith may help us see through our tears to what Jeremiah had long ago fixed his eyes on... that bright and blessed hope that makes all of today's heartaches a drop of water in the sun of eternity.
