Green         You are a very calm and contemplative person. Others are drawn to your peaceful, nurturing nature.           Find out your color at Quiz Me!                It's cold still. Bleh.  Auditions were last night. For more info, check out my other journal,  urlLink backstage with the diva  (also located in the links list on the right).  Fridays are both good and bad. Good, because I have plenty of time to get some homework done before the weekend, and because I only have to carry one book around all day for the one class I have that meets on Friday. Bad, because between Chapel and my sole Friday class, I have over 4 hours of nothing, which can get "dumb and bowing" (thank you, Homestar!).   I've got a little work to do over the weekend. Andy'll be practicing with his band, so I've got plenty of quiet time to get it done. I have my first test of the semester to study for (Christian Home, all fill in the blank, no multiple choice), and some experiments I have to get done for Vocal Performance. I have to dust and wash my bedding, go on vocal rest, and adjust the humidity and hydration in my house to see how it affects my voice. Then I have to write a paper about it. Oh, and I have to memorize three pages from  A Streetcar Named Desire  using my directing notes, so I can perform the scene with a random partner for Contemp. Drama.  The dog is driving us crazy. She's going through another chewing phase, and she's destroying our possessions. Andy's taken to smacking her on the butt and tossing her outside. Good thing, because I'm too softhearted to do it.  Oh, and everyone go to  urlLink Save Disney . The link's on the link list as well.  I'm off to the library to do research on  Merchant of Venice . The fun never stops.
