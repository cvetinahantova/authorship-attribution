Ah, and now something for April. A bit of T.S. Eliot's  The Wasteland    April is the cruelest month, breeding 	Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing 	Memory and desire, stirring 	Dull roots with spring rain. 	Winter kept us warm, covering 	Earth in forgetful snow, feeding 	A little life with dried tubers. 	Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee 	With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade 10 	And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, 	And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. 	Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch. 	And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke's, 	My cousin's, he took me out on a sled, 	And I was frightened. He said, Marie, 	Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. 	In the mountains, there you feel free. 	I read, much of the night, and go south in winter.
