Woooooooo!!!!!!! THe Plane flown off liao......Raine PANG SEH me!! last minute say cannot go kayaking....anyway...slept till 2pm.  Today's fitness programme was very much similar to yesterday's. Just did 20 more full squats. My thighs quite stiff now. Had a very light ( in comparison to wat i used to eat ) dinner. Mee Sua. Mom dowan to cook today...so eat mee sua lor. Tummy already telling me something now liao ....  I've got another job lobang today. Fruit Juice seller in Taka. Friend is contact the boss for me... see how it goes lor. If successful, can learn to make juices out of the variety of fruits available while earn some spare dough.  I decided to try out the home-made ORT ( oral rehydration therapy) after the excercise to replenish the salt, sugar and water content. The taste is not bad. Quick rehydration solution. Dont under estimate this concoction cos it saved million of lives throughout the world for cases of malnutrition. Normally used for diarreah. Can also be used for cramps. Anyone wana try? The formula is 1 teaspoon of salt to 6 teaspoon of sugar for every 1 litre of water.  The taste is not bad siah ...taste very much like the glucose powder we buy off the shelf:P.......heehee...i can prepare the salt/sugar mixture in advance for future trekking trips liao....just pour it into the water and ready to use liao. By the way, this home made mixture cost less than 5 cents per litre while the ones used by the hospitals cost 10 cents due to the added vitamins.    looking at my room now, i am so PROUD that i am able to mess it up again after cleaning it last week. Guessed i had to clean it up again liao ....sianz  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
