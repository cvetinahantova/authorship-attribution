Happy Tuesday. It's the 23, like Michael Jordan used to be.  I'll be in Michigan on the 4.  Recent recap: I went and saw "The Italian Job" It made me want a Mini Cooper and Charlize Tharon. I saw "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" and it made me want to go to Mexico. I saw "Lost in Translation" and it made me want to be Bill Murray. I went camping. I got dirty. I shaved today though. Now I'm clean. I went to Biola today. It's still there. Just felt weird going back. I haven't been there in a while.
