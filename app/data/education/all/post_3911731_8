today was about the gayest day ive ever had in my life. First off, i didn't do anything with janelle yesterday, i was planning on doing something with her today and it turns out kelsi ness, her cousin, slept over, so she was at janelles house all day so me and janelle couldnt do anything. Well guess what, kelsi is sleeping over there again tonight. Have fun with that. I also found out that janelle can't go to the beach with me, whatever, bretts going now so its all good. I'd rather have janelle hang out with me and have her talk to jeremy anytime she wants then to have her never end it with kelsi because this is getting good. Kelsi hates it when janelle calls me and she is there so when janelle calls on nights that kelsi is sleeping over, she talks for like one second. Awesome. So yea, i sat here yesterday, i sat here today, and im gonna sit here again tomorrow. Im sleeping over at bretts house on saturday though, so i finally get out of this dumb town and get to hang out with someone. Then im probably spending all next weekend at his house also, should be awesome. Well thats all i have to say right now, obviously there will be another update tomorrow night. later
