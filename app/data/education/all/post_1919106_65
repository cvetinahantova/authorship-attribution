More computing hell   Ok, I  f*cking hate  those Dell powerEdge 2650 servers!!! We've now spent over a week trying to get a custom kernel to boot one of these whiny beasts, and every time we get the same f*cking error - VFS blah blah cannot mount root. The root partition that is pointed to  is  the right one (/dev/sda3, aka 803, aka 08:03). The drivers for the RAID card also seem to work... So what the f*ck is wrong? And apparently everyone else using these machines has the same problem... Today (I mean, yesterday) I even tried with the latest beta of the 2.6 kernel, which supposedly includes all the fancy drivers needed, but it crapped out too (I  did  get a different error upon kernel panic, but that's probably because I enabled kernel debugging.) I asked around the openMosix listserv, but noone could help there either. My last chances are with the Dell listserv and the software that came with the servers... Given, most of it is for RedHat Linux, but maybe, just maybe, they have the proper patches. All I need is a bootable kernel with the openMosix and Migshm patches applied... Is that too much to ask for?
