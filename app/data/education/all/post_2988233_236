Renee and Stan came down tonight.  Just for a little while, but it was nice to have company over.  If you can consider them company.  The boys were wanting to target practice with Stan's 9mm and Tommys 357 magnum.  Guess what they were wanting to use for target practice ?   My Dale.  They thought it would be a fantastic idea to use my lifesize man as their target.  I told them no way, no how, that was MY man.  Now I fear that one day, I will come home from the store to find my Dale outside with holes in him.  They already use their nerf guns on him.  Boys.
