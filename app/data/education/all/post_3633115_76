Today they came to take the  urlLink mustang . The new owners I mean. I'm really going to miss that stupid car, but I'm also really glad that it is finally out of my driveway.  At least now there is room to park the other cars and not look like I own a junk yard or mini car dealership.  I'm just a posting fool tonight aren't I?  Actually, this post was just to see how to link to an archive message.  But the post is still true.
