I say no, nay, never! *clap-clap-clap-clap* No, nay, never, no more! *clap-clap* Shall I play wild rover! *clap* No nay, never, no more!       Medieval Manor last night was wonderful.   The peasant man, Squint, was attractive. He reminded me of Jay Buckley. Coincidentally, Maggie turns to me and says "He looks like your type!".... Moments later "Who's my type?? I have ears like a hawk!", followed by me laughing and blushing profusely.   Twas funnier this go around. The crowd got more into it.       A six course meal is just too much, really.       This time I got a doggie bag to go. The bag had dogs on it, and a printed song. Haha.   Let's all go there when we're 21!        I'll fix this up later, I'm out to look for fabric and patterns for a skirt... G'day to you all.
