Still fighting this bronchitis - NOT fun...  Wavering about next week's trip with Buck.  Will try to call him and cancel due to Dr.'s orders.  Will have to find gold some other time...  Will also play around with more webcam stuff - time to price out a computer for home.  Maybe should wait 'til fall and see what my budget looks like for technology.  Should also get my tax paperwork organized so that next my NAGT stuff isn't hard to do next spring.  Filing, filing, filing...  Will also read more Kohn to help with parenting challenges...  Signing off...  Oh yeah, one more thing, need to get Laura's email address; try to set her up with webcam capabilities...  hasta luigi
