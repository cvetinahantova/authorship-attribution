So Dave was gone from 7-17 through 7-20 (today!)  He was in Atlanta staying at an "exciting" Red Roof Inn.  He was actually very bored being stuck in the room for three days straight.  Anywho, he was there because he had an interview with Atlantic Southeast Airlines to be a CRJ (regional jet) pilot.  He is very excited because he went to both phases of the interview and flew the flight sim better then a pilot with more hours then him.  We are all crossing our fingers and praying for him in hopes that this is the job God wants for him.  He returned today and showed me all of the things he had to do in his interview.  It's amazing how much I don't know about being a pilot.  Yea! for Dave's great interview and we'll see what happens...
