HEY...I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY THAT I FEEL EVERYONE WILL GREATLY ENJOY READING. I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT OUR LIVES HAVE OFFICIALLY BECOME A SOAP OPERA.  THIS ONE DOESN'T LIKE THIS ONE, THIS ONE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THIS ONE IS DOING . MAYBE THIS ISN'T SOUNDING THE BEST COMING FROM ME...BUT MY GOD IN MY EYES, AT THIS MOMENT, WE'RE ALL LOOKING LIKE LITTLE KIDS WHO CAN'T  RESPECTFULLY  WORK OUT OUR PROBLEMS.  ALL OF US NEED TO FRICKEN WAKE UP AND SEE THAT NOT EVERY FAMILY IS THE SAME . I, for an example, do not have the gracious freedom many of you have. No...not all of you have a TON of freedom...but majority of you have a whole lot more than me. Josh R's family is very family oriented and traditional...don't like it...then deal with it. He was raised that way, can't change it, and lives with it. If you ask if he can do something and he can't because he's spending time with his family don't screw him for it. ONCE AGAIN, NOT EVERY FAMILY IS THE SAME, READY TO DO ANYTHING WITHIN 30 MINUTES, DROP EVERYTHING FOR THEIR KID AND LET THEM DO WHAT THEY WANT. Some live structured lives, some don't. If it sounds like I'm a bit mad...you're right...I am. Everyone...and I do mean EVERYONE at one point has had something to say because of someone else not being able to do something or not doing it the same way as someone else. ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BE A BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER. IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM...TALK TO EACHOTHER. MAYBE YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHATS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES. THATS ALL I ASK OF YOU...  ASK  .   Hope you all enjoy reading this and getting mad at each other for it...but I tell you this...before you go opening your lovely mouth...try thinking about what I said first....
