Haha! I'm drunk!    It's Tuesday night. Or Wednesday morning, depending on how one looks at the situation.    I spent it primarily with Kvale, secondarily with Hanson, tertiary with Beth, Emily, and Molly, further supplementary social interaction provided by Chelsey, Donovan, McManus, Karl, Ethan, JJ, and Emily's two cats, Winston and Kittie.)    Goodnight.    (But it was a good, enriching night.  And my spelling is better than Kvale's while he's sober.  Did you notice how I used one disjunction and two conjunction at the beginning of a sentence in this message, which is poor grammar unless intended, up to this point?  I did, and I'm drunk!  Notice the time.  (The temporal, not spiritual variety, of time) I got to the bar at 8:10pm, because my favorite professor held class for an extra twenty minutes.   But everything is alright.  I worked hard today.  I read Plato's "Protagoras," and Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground", in part.  Wheee!  Hanson just got his wisdom teeth pulled.  He looks like a chipmunk, because his cheeks are swollen.)  Before I was drunk, I was sober.  And my sober day was very good and industrious.  I read previously mentioned things.    Goodnight.
