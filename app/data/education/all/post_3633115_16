I am so proud of myself.  I finally have started a project and actually completed it.  Virtually all my life I lived in rental properties or military installations.  I have almost never had curtains.  Until today.  I went out yesterday and bought an entire bolt of denim fabric (5.25 yards), and I am making curtains for Shorty's room.  I completed the first panel yesterday with almost no help!  S had to help a bit because the panels were so big, that I couldn't seem to work them alone.  Finally, that sewing machine my parents gave me for Christmas two years ago is being put to use! :)  My mom would be so proud to know that I actually tried to do it and succeeded.  The panel doesn't exactly look professional and it isn't square, but dammit, I did it and I'm proud!  Hopefully, when I'm all done and have all the panels installed (2 windows, 4 panels), then Shorty will sleep later.  He gets up because "the sun's awake" and therefore we should all be awake...at 6 am.
