urlLink     urlLink     Irony.  I've bitched about it before.  So many of us seem to have forgotten what it means and use it to legitimize apathy, dishonesty, laziness and bad fiction.  What's so interesting about saying the exact opposite of what you mean?  What's so great about quotation marks anyway?    And hey:  what's so ironic about a chimp wearing terry cloth and pointing a pistol?  If chimps were regularly murdered with pistols, perhaps this might approach irony.  Like my college roommate used to say:  "Rain on your wedding day isn't ironic unless your the greek god of sunny weddings.  Otherwise, it just sucks."  But I don't want to overstate the case, either:  A gun toting chimp is pretty goddamn funny.    So why can't it just be that?  I wholeheartedly enjoy the above photograph, without a trace of a smirk.  You got a "problem" with that, "Punk"?
