This is too funny - a website called  urlLink Awful Plastic Surgery.  The top part is George Michael, but the really notable one is Lance Bass toward the bottom of the page. That is some insane shit! Totally new face.   For all you 80's hags there are some scary pictures of Marilyn - the Boy George protege, who now looks like an old crone.
