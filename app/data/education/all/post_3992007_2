Yes, that title does lend itself to some racey ideas, but really it is just my first time using a web log.  How exciting for me, I feel that I am climbing up the ladder of technology as I write this, although I pretty much know that I will still be writing in an actual journal at home.  It is just such a fun thing for me to do.  I decided to finally end that sentence.  So, my summer is about half over and I'm feeling alright about that.  I have been wanting to socialize much more than I have been able to, but that's alright.  I have to savor those moments of complete relaxation on my couch while they last.  I've also been watching many movies that are bad for the head of a single female.  That's right, chick flicks are very unhealthy for a woman who has little to no intentions of dating within the near future.  With teaching it is just all too difficult.  I don't think it would be fair for me or the guy who would be involved.  I know, I was warned by the crazy Mexican man who I met in Paris that I have to enjoy my body now before I get old and fat, but I don't have time for it and really, do I have to get fat when I get old?  Is that something that happens to everyone?  I don't think so - I see lots of skinny old ladies out there, although many of them look like their veins are ready to pop out of their skin and that isn't really attractive either.  Maybe I will just be single forever.  Is that really a terrible thing?  Hmmm. . . I will have to think about that although lately all I've been thinking about is meeting my future husband just like Mandy Moore in Chasing Liberty.  I know, it is such a pathetic thing to be watching movies like that, but I just can't help myself right now!  I will have to go get Trainspotting for tonight or something equally nonromantic so that I can kill the hormones that are coursing through my body.  I'm so dramatic.  What a load of crap.
