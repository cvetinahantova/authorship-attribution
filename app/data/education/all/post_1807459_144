Wow I think I got carried away on that last post.  I had a hell of a lot of typos too.  If you couldn't figure out what I was saying go back and try again as I've now proof most of it.  Not much really new to say.  It seems I've been noticing a lot of stuff lately.  First is that there are a lot of homeless/crazy Koreans.  Much more then I thought there were.  I think this is b/c I live downtown and I get to see them all the time.  Also it seems that there are a lot more tall girls.  Man, I don't know how I missed this before.   I'm going to watch Dawn of the Dead tonight.  From what others have said I think I'll enjoy it.  I'm not expecting much but I never do when I watch a movie in Korea.  I only want to be entertained.   I've found my new love is for a McDonald's ice cream cone and a cookie.  The combintaion of the two is absolutly delicious.  I use the cookie to scoop the ice cream off the cone make an "ice cream cookie" so to speak.  Really good, I suggest you try it.  Micky D's also has some really good cookies I have to admit.   I should be out of here next Wednesday for those of you who don't know.  I'll be flying to Bangkok with Gumi James and then I'll head off alone from there.  I should head East through Cambodia, taken in the sights along the way.  Then I'll roll into Vietnam and move South to North.  I'll then come around into Laos and finally back into Thailand.  I'm pretty darn excited.  There is a lot that I want to see.   This weekend should be Arabian Night's unless the Pappmaster decides not to go again.  I hope to have an extra "crazy" weekend before my trip.  Oh, it should last in the realm of 2 and a half months.  If anyone wants postcards be sure you get me your address.
