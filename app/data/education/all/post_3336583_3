I am in  baby heaven ! Two of my best friends had babies this week. Pammie had a little girl (Cora Ann) on Tuesday and Julie had her second child (Alexander Neil) on Thursday. Both moms and babies are doing well. The babies are soooo adorable. And I'm not just saying that because their my friend's babies, they really are  super  cute!
