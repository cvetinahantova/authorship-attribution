All right...after phone calls, and e-mails, and IMs galore, I finally know where I'm going to be pretty much all of next week.  Here's how it looks:  Early Saturday morning:  Leave NJ and go to Baltimore.  Spend the day with Kristen.  Sunday morning:  Fly to New Orleans.  HelLO Mardi Gras!  Thursday morning:  Leave New Orleans and fly to Baltimore.  Take the bus from...Baltimore to Philly, Philly to NY, and NY to Utica.  I will arrive in Utica at 2:00 AM.  Monday:  Interview at Pratt.  5:45 PM, catch the bus back to NYC, and from there to NJ.  Tuesday morning:  Drag myself out of bed on what I am sure will be almost no sleep to start...another fabulous work week!  And just a side note:   A bus ticket from Baltimore to Philly to New York to Utica?  $49.   A bus ticket from New York to Utica?  $52.   Trying to figure out the Greyhound pricing system?  A priceless headache.
