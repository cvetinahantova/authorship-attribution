I'm writing this post from my living room because today I just hooked up my new wireless router.  Now I can use my laptop to post to the blog and surf the internet and so on and so forth.  Give it up for wireless technologies and wireless routers because they are badass.  Now I'm gonna cook dinner and surf the net at the same time, biotch.
