have i meantioned amanda's gone home for the weekend?  i don't think so... do you know how much i love having the place to myself for a few days?   answer: a LOT!  not that we don't do fine when we're both here... but like, e.g. right now i'm making sweet tea, jello, and cookies in the kitchen, stereo blasting a CD full of memphis songs in my room, loud enough i'm sure you can hear it well outside, all the windows and doors wide open and a peach-scented candle lit -- i can't do all that at once when she's here =P  yay.  back to work, really this time. =P
