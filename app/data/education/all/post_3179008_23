Two of the girls in my class were talking to each other about the hair on their legs this morning. I have heard these conversations before, but it always strikes me funny that these "young ladies" have to go without shaving their legs due to the risk of self injury; possibly the injury of others as well. One of the girls is blond, and the other brunette. The blond one hadn't shaved in two weeks, but you couldn't tell. The brunette had shaved in four days, and it was noticeable.   The girls who live in the group homes can have the opportunity to shave if they go home on the weekends, or other passes. The community kids generally shave when they like. I guess that is a measure of their success compared to the kids in the group home settings.    It is so easy to take for granted all the hard lessons that were learned all those years ago. Watching these students go through their trials and challenges helps me to remmeber that I struggled too. I have to step back into my childhood thought processing in order to be able to understand, to a small degree...   Life is rough, but there is beauty all around. Everywhere!!!
