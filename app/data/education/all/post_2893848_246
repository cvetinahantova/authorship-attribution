Christopher Hitchens deconstructs/criticizes Michael Moore's new movie on  urlLink Slate .  He goes so far as to throw down, in perhaps the most awesome paragraph to ever appear on Slate.  I know, that's not saying a whole lot, but still:  as for [Moore's] scary lawyersâ€”get a life, or maybe see me in court. But I offer this, to Moore and to his rapid response rabble. Any time, Michael my boy. Let's re-do Telluride. Any show. Any place. Any platform. Let's see what you're made of.  I hate Michael Moore.  He reminds me of those kids in college who would handcuff themselves to an administrator's office door and sing "we shall overcome" into the night.  Purportedly, they do this for the sake of sweatshop labor, but the unstated benefits to the participants-- socially, personally, etc-- always seemed dishonest, petty, and a bit too reminiscent of summer camp.  It worries me that some people just like being righteous and that the variety of their indignation is more or less incidental.  Like  urlLink Mitchum  in " urlLink Night of the Hunter ," but not as psychotic/murderous.
