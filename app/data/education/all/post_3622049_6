Every time I hear another US soldier has been killed or injured in Iraq my heart skips worried about you.  Are you okay?  It's been over a week since I last heard from you, but maybe your just busy.  Maybe I'm crazy to worry, but I just got you back in my life, my dear friend, and I don't want to lose you now.  Stay safe and I'll hope for peace.
