just earlier this day, i was watching my friend, carla, playing her guitar not knowing a couple of hours later i'd have my own.  i came home quite late and bummed having missed jammi's call. i remembered my tito just came home cebu, the city if guitars, but he wasn't home the time i got home. i recall asking him to buy me a guitar but of course he refused. he insisted he won't buy something unnecessary. but when i was combing my hair in my room, our housemaidknocked at me door. no words could match my ecstacy whe i saw that black leather-like guitar case in her hand. i couldn't believe it! my tito actually bought me a guitar.  monique called afterwards and that was when i started to cry, being unable to control my joy. it was simply awesome! she was right, my tito really loves me. and guess what, i love him, too.  i thought it wouldbe easy to start on my own. turns out, it's really hard when i'm alone. i'm gonna wait for jammi to call and i'm probably gonna recieve his lessons. i just hope he's not too pissed off because i missed his call again. but, hey, we're not committed or anything.  i'm never gonna forget that it was my tito who bought me my first guitar. something i really really wanted. i've been saving for it and i didn't expect having one in a month or so. this is a dream come true!
