I think facial recognition software is a good idea.  If nothing else, to have a database of parents who check there kids in and out.  I know in our school, it is hard to know each and every student, and who his/her parents are.  I think this would be a valuable asset in schools.  We currently do not have photo ID badges for students.  HS faculty members have them for security/alarm purposes.  Students do not have them for any reason.  These IDs could be used for lunch cards, hall passes, identification in the community, etc.  I do not see a violation of any rights or personal liberties by establishing a database of parent and student photographs.  Those that did not wish to participate in such a program could sign a waiver releasing the school from liability of allowing students to check out with the wrong people.  BC
