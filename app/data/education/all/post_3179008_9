Hey,   What a busy week last week. We had a state audit of our files and school curriculum. That was pretty  stressful. But what really made it difficult was that we had planned a talent show for the kids on Thursday night. We also had a rock climbing outing, which was great. The Feather River is quite a site this time of year.    We also got two new students this last week, and we had a long time student leave. It's great to see them leave, but it also means adjusting to new students. At least, at this point, the culture of the school is strong, and set by the staff. New students generally must conform to the system. Ha ha ha.    A lot of the folks I work with are Kings fans. I am a Laker fan, have been since the early 80s. I also like the Kings, though, having liked Mitch Richmond. Anyway, the rivalry is fun, and it helps to cut the edge off of the stress and drama around here.   The administration has been worried about the student count, and consequently the funding. A suggestion has been made to add 10 days to the end of our already extended school year. We would end the regular year on June 11th, and return the following Monday 15th until July 29th. Yes,...July 29th. That's not all!  We also have a component of the program which usually runs two weeks in August, leaving two weeks for vacationing. The admin. also wants to see the August component extended by two more weeks. All said and done, we, the staff of the school, would essentially get three to five days of summer vacation.   Money, money, money,and more.  The group homes would love to have the school run 12 months a year. The foster care agency would love that too. It would greatly benefit many parts of the agency, but at the cost of the sanity of the school staff. Plus, the teachers would have to have their contracts renegtotiated. Politics. Money. Pushing Agendas.    Breathing,  Dave
