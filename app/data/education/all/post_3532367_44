Better late then never. Spent friday lunch and after work looking at cars - one was very nice but basic spec, (not even PAS). Later on I helped a mate move his freezer, washing machine and bits back into his kitchen, after havinig a new floor laid.  Saturday was fine, spent the morning looking at cars - none to my liking. Came up with the idea of going for a slightly better model by going for a newer used car via a dealer. I thought that with a deposit of 1500 I would be ok aiming for 50 quid a month. Found a nice couple of Clio's - over budget though. Took the family out for a cycle ride in the afternoon, along the canal, which the kids, Sandra and I enjoyed. Later in the evening we went over to some friends for a meal. Enjoyed the evening, even though I had to go tea-total. I joked with Sandra about having skipped the main course (there wasn't that much and we both thought it was the starter).
