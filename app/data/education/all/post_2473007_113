Found this old railroad bridge tucked away in the woods of lower Chatham.  I don't think it's in service anymore, but it does carry with it quite a bit of character.  I did a lomo effect ex post facto, which I think really works with the composition of the shot. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink S2400102 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink PlasticMind .
