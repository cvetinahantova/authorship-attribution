Wow, what an amazing place, the coutryside here is something that will be etched in to mind for many years to come. The serene rolling lanscape of southern France has grown like sleeping mushrooms the gentle orange earthbrick houses that are apart of the larger wine making community of france. The greenery of the landscape shows many signs of the local culture, wine is such an interwover aspect of society here that the signs of it soon become as natural as the moss covered bolder or the acient trees with finger like roots sprawling across the countryside. the vineyards to crawl like roots, and they cover a large majority of the land that surrounds the chaeau where we are staying. There is little that is not now been converted in to vineyard. Should you wish to wonder to the hills you will also find select areas of the finest crops, in what would surely become some of those rare and cheished bottles of wine so expensive, that only those who have yet not sold their soul, could purchase.  Something interesting to note, fully mature vines are only around a foot off the ground over here.
