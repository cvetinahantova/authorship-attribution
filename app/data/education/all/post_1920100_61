Hello Well today I had my kickboxing class. This class was intense but fun. When I was comming out of the locker room the trainer was joking by saying you look like you have been working out...because my friend and I were sweating. I really have been enjoying working out I have more energy and I am finally able to fit it into my schedule.  Camp is going good we are almost done with this first week. We have more one week to go and the next session starts. We will get a new set of kids. The next session is longer though, it is going to be 3 weeks. At our school today (CSUF) they had the KROQ WARP concert. They were a lot of people and they setted up a lot of booths.  My mom left today with my sister and the kids to El Paso to my cousins quincenera. I wanted to go see my family but it is too rushed so I decided not to go.  This saturday I am going with some friends to a concert. I can hardly wait!!
