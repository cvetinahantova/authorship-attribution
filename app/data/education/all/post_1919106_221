Unless you've turned image loading off on your browser, you will have noticed that I've started posting pictures here. Nothing out of the ordinary there. The nifty thing though is that these pictures have been posted using  urlLink Hello . So if you feel like dropping me a line (or a picture) every once in a while, you may as well try to find me there in the rare occasions that I'm online. My handle is DocBoobenstein.
