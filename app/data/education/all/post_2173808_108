Heres a link to an  urlLink article  I just published on the Red v. Blue divide.  In it, I argue that despite often breathless claims in the media, there is little evidence to suggest that the United States is becoming increasingly segregated along political lines. Most Americans continue to live in electorally competitive areas and where they have a great deal of exposure to members of the other party.  In particular, I take apart many of the claims set out in the recent  urlLink Austin  American-Statesman   report on political segregation.
