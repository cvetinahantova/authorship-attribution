"Behind Blue Eyes" by Limp Bizkit  No one knows what it's likeTo be the bad man To be the sad man Behind blue eyes And no one knows What it's like to be hated To be faded to telling only lies  [But my dreams they aren't as empty As my conscious seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free]  No one knows what its like To feel these feelings Like i do, and i blame you! No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain woe Can show through [chorus] Discover l.i.m.p. say it [x4] No one knows what its like To be mistreated, to be defeated Behind blue eyes No one know how to say That they're sorry and don't worry I'm not telling lies [chorus] No one knows what its like To be the bad man, to be the sad man Behind blue eyes.  This song is how I feel.. music and all. Loves Sheila
