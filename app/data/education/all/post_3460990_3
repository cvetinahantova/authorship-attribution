Went to a job fair tonight. Results were pretty good, I think. I got 3, count 'em, 3,  follow up interview offers. All 3 are jr. high, so I'd be teaching 7th or 8th grade, but 2 of the 3 want to not only utilize my English degree, but also my Performance Studies. One school is an arts academy, the other needs a coach for their speech club. Whee! I am so excited by the idea that I could have a solid placement in the next few weeks!  Holly, I am really looking forward to your visit. Can't wait to show you around the neighborhood, and maybe, if things go well, my classroom!
