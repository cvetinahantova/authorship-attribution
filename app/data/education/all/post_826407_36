Been getting  urlLink New Internationalist  for a while and love what it does and stands for.  Sometimes the magazine can be a bit hard going.  Not so with this month's edition though.  Its all about music.  There's some sobering remarks about the links between big record labels and arms/electronics corporations and some excellant articles about different groups using music for protest, celebration or community development.  A very healthy read.   It also comes with an excellant free CD called Songs of Dissent that's been put together by the  urlLink Peace not War Coalition .  Lots of fresh, exciting music with a real message and well worth listening to.
