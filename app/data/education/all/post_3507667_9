So I was watching  urlLink CNN  last night for a minute while taking a break from studying and there was a report on global warming and the rise of American's buying urlLink SUV's  as there preferred method of transportation. The reporter interviewed several Americans who seemed to be well educated and well spoken. Each of them when asked why buy an SUV knowing that they are adding to the already growing problem of environmental global warming gave pretty much the same answer: "I'm an American, and this is our lifestyle.  urlLink Bigger is better ." This is an actual quote from one of the interviewees and resembled quotes by the others.  Well my jaw dropped. To this point I knew that Americans were for the most part self-absorbed and ignorant of the world around them, but I had not realized to what extent.   I know that Americans are very urlLink proud  and patriotic folks. They believe in  urlLink freedom , they believe in urlLink justice , and they have an overwhelming belief that they are urlLink superior  to all other urlLink countries . They have decided that they should destroy the planet because, "Bigger is Better", well who's going to stop them. Obviously they don't have the ability to urlLink  police  themselves let alone other countries, yet, there they are doing so in spades. They have the highest urlLink murder rate  per capita then any other country, they have the highest rate of urlLink domestic violence  than any other country, they have the urlLink highest incarceration rate  of any other country (the majority of those incarcerated being of non-Caucasian background).  The list goes on and on and on.  Another thing that boggles the mind, think of how many shows there are like urlLink Jerry Springer  on television, now consider that they do a show a day for a season of approx 8 months, and have an average of 6 guests per show. Do the math. That is a significant representation of the population of the USA. Pretty scary when you consider the manner of these folks on these shows.  I have a very great respect for urlLink Michael Moore , because I think he has the ability to look outside the box and view the problems that America is facing right now and that the focus of the urlLink current government  is skewed from where it should be targeted. Others like urlLink  Bill Maher  are trying there best to try and reveal the hypocrisy that is the USA's foreign policy and political state. Then at the very other end of the spectrum you get complete idiots like  urlLink Rush Limbaugh  spouting off his urlLink sexist , prejudicial views to a welcoming below normal IQ listening audience doing his best to keep the norm.  Let's hope that the Americans, who are the core are good people that have  just lost themselves, wake up and realize they live on a planet with others and those others are getting a little tired of the bully on the block. urlLink We all know what happens to bullies, history is full of them, and they've all fallen........hard!!   Hereth the bashing endeth.  RLB
