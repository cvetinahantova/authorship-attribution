When I was young enough to still spend a long time buttoning my shoes in the morning, I’d listen toward the hall: Daddy upstairs was shaving in the bathroom and Mother downstairs was frying the bacon. They would begin whistling back and forth to each other up and down the stairwell. My father would whistle his phrase, my mother would try to whistle, then hum hers back. It was their duet. I drew my buttonhook in and out and listened to it—I knew it was “The Merry Widow.” The difference was, their song almost floated with laughter: how different from the record, which growled from the beginning, as if the Victrola were only slowly being wound up. They kept it running between them, up and down the stairs where I was now just about ready to run clattering down and show them my shoes.  -Eudora Welty, “One Writer’s Beginnings”    Carrie looked behind her. The theater was full of fourth and fifth graders waiting for the Saturday matinee to start. Anyone older was conspicuously taller in the rows of small heads, like a weed overlooked when the grass is cut. Near the center[,] Carrie could see several such heads sitting together and recognized them as kids from her class. She supposed they could recognize her, too, down there in the third row with Duncan and his friends. She turned around and looked at the screen. As if that were a signal, the cartoon began.  The cartoon was dumb. The main feature was terrible. After the first thirty minutes[,] Carrie stopped paying attention and simply watched the figures moving on the screen. Duncan and his friends loved it. They commented on everything. The audience buzzed. They were watching Laser Man scale the side of a crater. Carrie shifted in the seat, stretched her legs sideways, and tried to be interested. Laser Man was boring through solid rock with his laser eye beam. The mountain was crumbling. Then huge[,] green space lizards appeared [sic.] crawling toward him. Beside her, Duncan drew his breath.  Carrie reached over and took a handful of popcorn. She figured the movie was three-wuarters over. One of the lizards had Laser Man pinned on the edge of a precipice. Why didn’t he just use his eye beam and crumble the thing? She glanced at Duncan. He was sitting far forward in his seat, chewing slowly.  Then something happened, but Carrie missed it. The lizard was catapulting into the chasm. The mountain was falling to dust around him. The audience cheered. Then Laser Man was kissing Cynthia. The movie was nearly over.   -From Zibby O’Neal’s “The Language of Goldfish”         Manila is a city of extremes. The poor are very poor and the rich[,] very rich. They live side by side. The rich live in sprawling houses in residential subdivisions with fancy names like Green Meadows, White Plains, Corinthian Plaza, Bel Air, San Lorenzo, Magallanes and the very exclusive Forbes Park, a leafy enclave that was home to the famous Manila Polo Club. The poor are not far from sight. They live in little pockets on the periphery of these affluent subdivisions. A constant reminder to the right that there is another side to life.  Near the harbor stands the historic Manila Hotel, a grand old hotel whose penthouse had been home to General Douglas MacArthur before the Second World War, and the likes of Aldo Gucci, and where today the wealthy continue to dine and dance and where businessmen come to hold breakfast meetings involving [million-dollar] deals. In the shadow of its modern tower, built in the mid-seventies, you will find Manila’s biggest slum—Tondo. Tondo and its surrounding areas are home to the city’s poor. The place is so congested that houses, if they can be called that, stand next to each other, most measuring no bigger than the size of a single bedroom. In this cramped area, families of five, six, even ten, sleep together.  In my convent school days, the nuns took us to Tondo on a field trip one day. It was intended as an eye-opener. To show us how the less fortunate lived so that we may learn how to feel some compassion for them and in the process[,] learn to be more appreciative of what we had. But compassion has done little to close the gap between our world and theirs. The structures that determine poverty and health have been in place for centuries.    -From Arlene Chai’s “The Last Time I Saw Mother”    The robber was apprehended by the police. He was a gaunt-faced man of five feet and two inches. His hair was a mass of unruly curls cut short by a lazy barber. His eyes were round and dark and questioning. The people in the precinct called him a no-good menace; but the people who knew him better called him Pablo.   -Sometimes Mary, “An Intro to Pablo”
