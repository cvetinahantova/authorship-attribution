My boys are HUGE HUGE Lord of the Rings fans.  I do mean huge.  I have actually had to break up arguements over who is the biggest hero, Aragorn or Legolas.  Personally I am an Aragorn fan.  Viggo is jsut too cute.  Orlando is too, but I digress...  Right now, my boys are in the kitchen in their best Aragorn voices saying "Syrup we need your thickinesssss"  After the line in the movie "legolas we need your bowwww"  Kids.    THey have even made up new characters for each other, combining Star Wars and LOTR.  Son #5, is an apprenctice that Gandolf is training ins wizardry.  How do you get star wars and LOTR together like that???? I don't know ask my kids.
