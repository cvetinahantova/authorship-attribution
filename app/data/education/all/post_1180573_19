for those who have mistaken my twinkle star and me...     ~*~   don't judge me!   these words are truly mine but are not truly me  they might indeed be a whine but are just a part of me  i feel, i sense, i live not just for the joyfulness i listen, i care, i receive not only the happiness  but i should be drain i must not weep though this unbearable pain is only for me to keep  hence, in this kinda way my twinkle star sets me free retaining the sadness grey not to be taken into me    so look deeply into my eyes and seek for the sorrow i dare you uncovering my disguise right here right now to show
