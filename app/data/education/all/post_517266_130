Alabama - Spoke at Athens High School to all the county sophomores.  It was sponsored by a group named T.R.A.I.L. who were an amazing group of young people who are focused on giving back to the world.  My program was followed by a volunteer fair where students could get involved with a variety of organizations.  It was a great idea and a great day.
