now i won't have any problems with jammi because i don't have to talk to him anymore. i was so pissed of i blew him off when he went online. why should i be so patient to tolerate his... presence? he didn't even say he's sorry, so why should i forgive him? doesn't that give me the right to be angry? our guidance counselor told to be angry isn't wrong because it's an emotion. i don't care if jammi kills himself. what does it matter? it's not like he's my boyfriend. i don't care, i can always find someone else. he may not be my "knight in shining armor with a guitar instead of a buckler", but, he would still be a guy. so what if jammi's sad? it's not my problem anymore.  though, i am being a bitch this way. i have no right to be angry because of some kind of rejection. i did reject him first so it's only fair. i was the one who caused all of these to begin with. maybe, it's bad karma...it is! i'm being punished for being so cruel, so stubborn so irrational. hell with it! i don't give a shit.  *** i met this guy throught mIRC today. he's really sweet and he likes me. i couldn't keep on noticing how nice he was but i know how fake it was. just as how fake i am to my own self...  *** god, i'm a fucking mess. i don't know what else to do with my life but mess it more. hey, it's the standard theory of life. when things become so messed up and its damage is irreversalbe, it comes back to its glorious form! if i keep messing this up, i don't think it's gonna come back to its glorious form, it's just gonna get worse and worse and worse....
