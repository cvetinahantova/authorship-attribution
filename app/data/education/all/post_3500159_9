Night before last I had the strangest dream and it really has me a little freaked out.  I dreamed that the whole family, Linda & Louis included were at this restaurant for someone's birthday celebration.  We were talking and suddenly the door opened and in walked Jeremy.   We all just were shocked and stared at him and didn't know what to think or how to behave because we all knew he had passed away in April, yet there he was, just like always, healthy as could be.....He smiled at us and said, "Just joking guys!  I didn't really die!"   And then everyone was angry at him for the horrible joke, but so glad to see him too.....And when I woke up I felt so strange because I can't figure out what that all means.  I don't know if it means anything at all, but it was so real and yet so strange.   I wish he could come back.......it sure would make so many of us happy again.
