Well, thanks to  urlLink Just Bob , I now have my very own  urlLink Gmail  account. I'm pretty pumped so far, as it runs quite smoothly and it has a GIG of storage. Hard to believe. But in Bob's words... I have no clue as to what I am going to do with a gig of storage... but I shall try! Too true, Bob...too true.  I'm thinking I'm going to centrally locate all of my mailboxes to Gmail once it leaves the beta stage. But right now, I'll use it as my secondary address. For those of you keeping score at home, here are my two e-mail addresses:   yahoo.at.andythegeek.dot.com   Oh, and my Gmail address is:   ymgeek.at.gmail.dot.com   The AOL address that I've been using for a while will be no more in a few weeks. I can't justify the cost of my AOL account since I have no computer at home right now.  Thanks again, Bob.
