I am more and more convinced that the AIDS crisis had a powerful influence on Alan Ball as he conceived of "Six Feet Under," even though he didn't respond to my question to that effect on "Ask Alan Ball" at the  urlLink Six Feet Under website   urlLink  . In yesterday's episode (#42, Parallel Play), Brenda and Joe use a condom, which is a reminder of the presence of AIDS. In another recent episode, Nan Goldin's photography inspires Claire--and Nan's photography featured people living with AIDS quite prominently. This evidence perhaps seems a little weak, but it is part of a pattern that has continued since the series began. I'm currently working on an essay on the subject.  Otherwise, I'm a little concerned by some of the plot lines. I don't like the direction that Freddy's heading!
