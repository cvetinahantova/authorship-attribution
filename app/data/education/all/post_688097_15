I can see a lot have change here on blogger. Then so should I and this blog of mine. As you can notice on the lay-out, there has been a lot of new addition to bloggers templates so I felt oblidged to use a new one. I also changed the title, Im not sure why I chose those words, I guess it has been in my mind for quite a long time that thats all I can think of for the moment. And besides, I like the sound of it. And for the "confessed virgin" thing, dont ask!!!  I just posted a poem, you can read it below and yes, Im in love (heck). And if your not keen enough to see, I have changed my name from julian carlo to carlo julian, whats the point? Well, since I will be posting my poems, essays, and other writings here starting now, I just thought it would be cool to have that as my pseudonym. In case you dont know, which Im sure a lot of you dont, julian means youthful and carlo means matured, cool huh? And so, If I put the carlo first(matured) before the julian(youthful), then I might actually be able to focus on some hidden thins about me that even I am not aware about. Am I starting to sound crazy?  Just to let you know, I just started college taking up Biology here in  urlLink Silliman University . It has been a roller coaster month(June). I dont have my computer with me though, Its all boxed up thousands of miles away from my dorm at home and I have no idea when my dad will have it shipped. Anyway, there are internet cafes on every block so there wouldnt be any problem on my part.  So, I guess thats about it for now, see you all later! =P
