Do you love words and the power of words?    Just want to pass on a website where you can subscribe for free to "A Word A Day". My sister started my subscription a few years ago. Try out  urlLink www.wordsmith.org   Each day you get a new word, its pronunciation, definition, origin, 2 examples of its usage in printed documents, and a quote a day. The website also contains archives by month issued, theme and words. Its been around for ten years.   If you haven't heard of it before, check it out and let me know what you think. -Deb
