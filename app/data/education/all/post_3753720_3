Tiger's iChat utilizes the H.264 video standard, bringing higher quality video over the same bandwidth and allowing for up to three people to video-chat at once. For those without an iSight, the new iChat also features improved audio-chatting functionality, and can be used to audio-conference with up to 10 people simultaneously.
