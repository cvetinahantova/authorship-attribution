THE DESERT OWNS US ALL I was supposed to cover this high school all-star soccer game yesterday, but I ended up in the desert, way out in the middle of nowhere.  I got there about half and hour late, but it was all good.  Here's the result of it all...  um, nevermind,  it's not on the website.  maybe tomorrow.  Anyhow, I get lost all the time.  I think It's a chronic problem for me. I eventually get to where I'm going, but it takes a while.  No matter what, I can usually be counted on to get lost at some point in any journey I take.  I thought  urlLink this  might help.  But then I came across the website  urlLink Dealing with Dementia: Help for Relatives, Friends and Caregivers .  Here's what it says:  Symptoms of Dementia  *	Marked Loss of Memory for Recent Events -Losing items -Getting Lost in �familiar� Places -Missing Appointments  *	Loss of Ability For Abstract Thought, Planning And Doing Complex Tasks -Trouble with Cooking, Paying Bills, Driving -Can�t Understand Books, Movies or News Items  *	Difficulty Finding Common Words And Names -Substitution of Approximate Phrases ("Where is the thing for sweeping?" for �broom�) -Misidentifying People (Confusing sister with [deceased] mother) -Use of "Empty Phrases" ("You know", "That thing")  *	Difficulty Inhibiting Behavior -Impulsivity, �Thoughtless� Comments, Socially Inappropriate Behaviors  I'd say that's pretty much me to a "T".  Well, at least that's one mystery solved.
