Starting to have more homework these few days from our Maths lecturer. This means that I'll need to put more time into my studies than what I had planned.     Well, looking at the bright side, this will stop me from going to the cyber cafe so often and wasting my money there : )      Our Korean lecturers showed us a movie just now, and of course it's in Korean (but we do have the subtitle or else we won't understand the whole story).     I dont know, may be it's because I'm getting old, I seem to be quite nostalgic lately.     I tend to think about how it would be like 6 or 7 years down the road. There will be many people that I might not meet again. People whom we were closed with might not be close to us anymore. Relationships will change. Most of us might not be who we used to be. Everything will change, for the better or for the worse...     Well, I know it's pointless thinking of all this, but I just can help it. Anyway, I might be too busy to think about all these next time, so I should think of it while I still have the opportunity, right? :p
