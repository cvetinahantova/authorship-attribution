There are 3 types of driver: those who are good drivers, those who are accelerator-happy and those who are brake-happy. Unfortunately, I fall into the last category; my driving lesson on Friday was good other than the fact that I stop the car about a mile short of junction lines, meaning that I can't see a thing and put both mine and my driving instructor's lives at risk when I turn a corner. Gah.  After much quick packing (which, incidentally, was totally inappropriate for this weekend as I have nothing to wear with sleeves longer than "short" and the weather is horrid), mother and I headed into the depths of West Bromwich in the direction of the (innapropriately named, in my opinion) Sandwell General Hospital so that a nice man called Mr. Chester could feel my lumps and stick an pointy instrument into me. Hehehehe. No no, nothing happened that could result in some sort of legal dispute: the horrible lump on the back of my ear got some steroids injected into it in the hope that one day it might shrink. Blergh.  Dad came to collect me from the hospital and now here I am, in his house, on his computer, talking to my friends from far far away. Dad says they're going to reorganise the house and move the "spare bedroom" downstairs and the study upstairs. Funny, I was under the impression that the "spare bedroom" was "my bedroom".  I should be revising Buddhism, currently. My exam is on Wednesday and I do not know  anything . Well, I know some stuff, but...meh.  Ceff x   All they know is how to put you down...
