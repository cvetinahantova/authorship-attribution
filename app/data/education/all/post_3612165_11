Start your day with a smile!     the son of a bitch    Little Johnny was heard by his mother reciting his homework: "Two plus two, the son of a bitch is four; four plus four, the son of a bitch is eight; eight plus eight, the son of a bitch...'"     "Johnny !" shouted his mother. "Watch your language! You're not allowed to use the swearwords."     "But, Mom," replied the boy, "that's what the teacher taught us, and she said to recite it out loud till we learned it."     Next day Johnny's mother went right into the classroom to complain. "Oh, heavens !" said the teacher. "That's not what I taught them. They're supposed to say, 'Two plus two, the sum of which is four.' " http://www.butlerwebs.com/jokes/littlejohnny.htm
