urlLink The Roman Empire  This is not directly related to information literacy (like many of my posts...) but I have found this site fun.  It has an excellent overview of the history of the Roman Empire from the founding of the Republic to the fall of the Western Empire.  It is a particularly good source for the biographies of Roman Emperors.  I imagine there is not a ton of money to be made off of a Roman history site so I admire the site owner for doing such a good job.
