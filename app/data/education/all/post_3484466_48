Well, I just intentionally dug myself in a deeper hole with Katy, and I'm not sure why. I seem to be slowly killing myself via other people, or something. It's crazy. Anyway, I've decided that I'm going to force myself into being a loner next year, so I can get a 4.0... I get too caught up in everything and nothing when I've got this many friends. So I'll just die my hair and wear different clothes, and disappear off the face of the earth. It'll be awesome. Actually, I probably won't, but I was seriously thinking about cutting and dying my hair. It might be interesting.  Anyway, I'm off to kill myself. Hah! No, I don't even think I could contemplate suicide, and it's not because of self-esteem, trust me. Right, well. Bye!  Current Music: No Doubt - Just A Girl
