- what happened yesterday -    So much happened yesterday.  If I wax essayistic about each *thing*, I could write an alternate universe.    So I'll try adapting the idiom of the internet -- brevity.  Ang & Ryan moved.  (after a long battle with U-Haul clerks who were annoyingly friendly)  Mark & Toby successfully installed the upstairs toilet! (no more midnight treks down two flights of stairs!)  Jeff, with my cowardly help, transported a SKUNK in our mini van from Marcia's back yard (it had lived under her house) to the local park / frisbee golf course. (Wives & Kids cheered as "Sonja" ambled through the grass to her new life.)  A woman in A & R's church told them, just before they went to sleep Saturday Night that a woman SHOT herself in their bedroom.  Where they have lived for the last year.    And though Ang didn't say this -- I'm pretty sure that this is a secret that their whole church has been keeping from them.  (The house they lived in is the "youth pastor house" for a string of youth pastors.)  Of course my interest in the story is primarily Proprietary --   PITCH: young couple moves from house where ghost has lived unbeknownst to them.  Ghost liked their life so much that she moved WITH them -- but started to act up once she was in a new * place *.      TOBY's ICING on the PITCH: The couple's spending all this effort trying to figure out how this ghost came to be in their new (older) home -- combing through history, etc... but they'll never find a record there, will they?  Because THEY BROUGHT the ghost from their home.   Dunh, dunh, dunh.  Addison slept in his NEW BIG BOY bed for the first two times yesterday and last night.  No problems.  He loves it!  Aunt Jan comes to town today! The whole family's excited...  peace~
