Today Rocky turns 1 year old! I sang to him two times in the morning and one time at night. He just looked at me like I was strange... Weird. (o: I also baked him 5 homemade (from a dog biscuit mix) dog treats. He loves them! Also I made 10 more for him to give to his close dog buddies. He gave one to Pascal (dog friend that lives down stairs), Rosco and Princess (my friend Shelly's dogs), Jedi (his cousin), Cosi, Lexi, and Kandy (his second cousins), Sassy (Laura's mom's dog), and Roxy (his girlfriend that is a rotwiler that lives across the complex).   He is a happy pup!
