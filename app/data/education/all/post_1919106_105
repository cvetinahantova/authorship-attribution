Grinding away the hours   So I'm finally settling down up here. After a lot of effort I got to meet my advisor, which in many points resembles my old advisor. And classes... Well, there's the good ones and there's the bad ones.  Social Implications of Computing  is quite enjoyable, and a definitive keeper.  Algorithms  is not. It reminds me too much of  Discrete Math . And  Intro to AI  is even worse - most of the formulas are gibberish to me. The only saving grace to it is that I'm much more advanced in the logic area than students here, and half of the class is about that.  The computing environment here is very different from A&M. First of all, there's no Linux. Just Solaris and Unix, and  neither of them have fortunes installed . Sacrilege! Well, at least I can still use the cluster for all my Linux needs, and for Windows boxen I borrowed my dad's laptop and Wi-Fi card. I just can't wait till my BeOS box finally gets shipped.  Work... Well, it's just started. I got the first batch of assignments, which got split among all of the TAs for the class. There's four of us. Yesterday one of the senior TAs showed me around the campus a bit. I finally got around to visit the grad house and their selection of draft beers - didn't get any though. But I  did  find out that there are wine tasting and beer tasting and other cool clubs around. The talks about quantum computing sound interesting.  There's still al lot to do however. For once, I need to ask for a PC instead of a thin terminal client, and ask for permission to put Debian GNU/Linux on it. And I got to check out the clubs. And the parties - can't forget those. And roleplaying groups. Maybe I can inflict my characters on other people, hmm?  Getting a regular sleeping pattern would be nice too. I'm up early in the morning most days. Then during the evenings I basically just sleep, and at night... Well, let's just say that nights are interesting enough.
