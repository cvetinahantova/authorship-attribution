Shaq is gone, Phil Jackson is gone, and now Derek Fisher is gone.  The Lakers are going nowhere next year.  Kobe, Gary Payton, Karl Malone, Lamar Odom, and Brian Grant as your starters don't exactly strike fear into your heart.  Caron Butler and Slava Medvedenko off the bench along with Karim Rush, Luke Walton, Rick Fox and Devean George I guess are ok.  I'll bet Kobe turns into a McGrady and just takes all the damn shots and doesn't try to win.    San Antonio is actually improved with the signing of Brent Barry. Sacramento and Minnesota are just as good. Dallas is not as good, but is still better than the Lakers.  The Suns have a court leader in Steve Nash who is more of a team player than Marbury is to go along with all that talent in Marion and Stoudemire.  Houston might get their act together with McGrady and Yao Ming if they can play defense.    I think al of those teams will potentially finish in front of the Lakers.  Which is good, since I don't like the Lakers.
