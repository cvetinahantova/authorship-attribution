In the movie  City of Angels , the main character has just made love to an angel.  She bicycles down a mountain road.  She closes her eyes, stretches out both arms, and raises her face to the sun.   Then she smashes into a logging truck, and dies in the angel's arms.   Is that what love is?  That moment of pure balance and light, just before eternal darkness?
