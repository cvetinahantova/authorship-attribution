For some strange reason, this song sooo reminds me of jeffie... So I'm dedicating it to him, and I'll but the lyrics too... I am such a loser man... The song is...   A Decade Under The Influence- (Obviousli) Taking Back Sunday....   Lyrics are... (Why am i such a loser) :P  Well, that's more sweet, so delicate It used to be this dying breed Well I've got a bad feeling about this I've got a bad feeling about this I kept still until the long drive home You slept safe and close to the window... Well, I've got a bad feeling about this I've got a bad feeling about... You used to say you'll have to go (I could go all night) Well say you'll have to go (I could go all...) To hell with you and all your friends To hell with you and all your friends, it's on Well thats more sure than porcelain You're skin and bones, I'm a nervous wreck Well I've got a bad feeling about this (because of this) I've got a bad feeling about this... Anyone will do tonight Anyone will do tonight Close your eyes, just settle, settle Close your eyes, just settle, settle And so on and so on and on and on and on...  Now that I am talking about songs that remind me of Jeffie, I think this song does...   Paris In Flames-Thursday...  haha, man i need a life, i wont even put those lyrics up...   But aw well, This post was for jeffie, I'll make more later... If i feel like it...
