Do you feel like MY guinea pig YET??  LOL, you should.... Ok , I think I have this figured out even though I am not happy with the results.  It appears that I can have multiple blogs on one service provider and I can post and publish to multiple blogs.  However, it appears that I can NOT post a message to my blogspot & lifewithchrist Blog at the same time. I have to create the message, cut and paste it into memory, post and publish to one account and then change accounts and post to the other.  I will demonstrate that in my next post so you can see what I mean jellybean......  :)
