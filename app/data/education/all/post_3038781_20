Can eyes implode?   Mine certainly feel like they would like the option. I am soooooooooooo tired. Was up to the weee hours working on a team paper. Sans team. Well that's not true two teammates posted worthwhile information, but the third.... not even close. Unfortunately for the second week in a row, I waited for him to pull his work through...then went back and researched it for myself and added what little [very little I could from his post to the paper]. I really don't need this kind of  @#$%#@.  But, I'm at a loss on what to do. If I pull back on the work that I've been doing and noone takes it up, my grade will fall right along with the rest of my teammate's grades.  I've tried to gently hint, then a little more bluntly, then frankly, but the response seems to be that I'm viewed as being a "little overly assertive". At the same time, two team members did not even begin researching a fairly complicated question [about whether 2 collectives should form multiple businesses and of what form from partnership to corporation] untill  the late evening  on the day it was due when the assignment had been posted all week.  I don't think it would have seemed so bad, even then if I wasn't the person integrating papers for the second week in a row.    I really could turn banshee right about now so I really really plan to stay away from the team folder... at least until my fourth coffee.
