Muses By Scott  In between thinking who is the best rapper/actor, I began to think about muses. Maybe because Tupac is in fact the best, and Janet Jackson is his muse in "Poetic Justice." However, Mos Def recently played a heart surgeon for an HBO movie, and was very good. And how about Ice-T in Law and Order? I don't count the rapper/actor/comedians, such as Snoop and Method Man / Redman; or the rapper/actor/action stars, such as DMX. Yes, Tupac is the winner.   While searching for muses using the internet, I found  urlLink this , which is good i guess.
