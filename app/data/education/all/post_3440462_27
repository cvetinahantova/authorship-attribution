Ever wonder what the masses are thinking about?  How about the Blogging masses.  Now you can know, thanks to  urlLink blogdex .  This site is like a google news for weblogs.  Blogdex's webcrawler pays attention to what sites weblogs are being linked to, and then posts the most popular sites.  This is a pretty accurate way of "polling" what people are reading/paying attention to, since most blogs  (like this one) use links to provide context for their comments.  Blogdex also has a  urlLink rss feed .
