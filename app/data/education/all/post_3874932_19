A series of items on our questionnaire involve attitudes about the internet (helps me stay more culturally current, more in touch with my family, I want to learn more about the internet) have a high Cronbach's alpha (.81) and can be summed together. The following factors predict more  positive  attitudes toward usage:    technology optimism  curiosity  technology discomfort (go figure, I double checked the sign of the relationship, but more uncomfortable people had more positive attitudes)   A proactive coping style was not related to attitudes towards internet usage.
