Plans change and I'll in seattle in 24 hours.  I'm really freestyling right now as frank would say.  Trevor and I are going to chill and make movies.  pray that money-making opportunities arise for me (i.e. job)  here or there.  I just want to be able to pay the piper (i.e. creditors).  I've been foolish in my monetary ways and the sharks are circling.
