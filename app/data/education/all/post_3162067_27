Tomorrow is the day of my big interview, and suddenly I'm very nervous. I've just printed off a load of history for the company and today I have been refreshing my memory with regards to Powerpoint and Excel. I am now convinced I am not going to get this job. Ugh, and an early start tomorrow. Wish I already had a job. A nice day at work today. The students were very well behaved and there was a lot of joking and courtesy. Admittedly, a boy also set fire to a girl's hair this afternoon...my school really is unbelievable. The sad thing is that this incident failed to shock me. Well, I am going to do a little marking then attempt to relax. I want to be nice and refreshed tomorrow. I hope I get this job. Wish me luck!
