Here she is learning to cast.   urlLink      Well, the lake was really cool.  Even though we got a lot of sun, we enjoyed fishing and swimming.  The weather was alright.  It was overcast most of the day Saturday, and at least until we left on Sunday.  In fact, I didn't see the sun until I went out to get the mail a few minutes ago.  It was very windy last night, so no one got much sleep, except for AbbieDabbie who slept right through most of it.  And, we lost one of our tents to the lake.  It was empty because it was the tent that we had brought for Abbie to play in, so she could be out of the sun.  Abbie was heart-broken about losing her tent, and cried for a while, but she is now over it.   She truly enjoyed fishing.  She had never done it, and we had to teach her everything.  It was so cool.  She didn't have the patience to wait for a fish to bite, but we let her run around for a while and leave her pole on a rock.  She really enjoyed it.  Man, I don't think I have ever seen her so happy before.  And that made the  whole  trip worthwhile.
