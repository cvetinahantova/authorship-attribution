Well I started off well. Got home and jumped on the bike to take it down the shop to get the gears repaired (in preperation for my exercise routine set by the doctor). I got to the cycle shop at 16:50 and it had shut - everything had been put away and there were still 10 minutes to closing time! Bastard!  Decided then it would be best not to waste the opportunity and took off down the canals - with only 6 of 21 gears working, pedalling like a mad man. Half way round, would you just know it, I got a thorn in my tyre. It had gone all the way through. I decided the best option was to leave it in so that it acted like a plug. It seemed to work, I completed the 9.5 miles without much problem and even decided to come home a different route so that I got more hills! The puncture was fixed in a couple of minutes once I had got home and the whole adventure from start to finish took less than an hour. All in all I am quite pleased with myself.
