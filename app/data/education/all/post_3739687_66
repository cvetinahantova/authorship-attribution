hello,  well sister erlinda has confirmed it again.  she's crazy.  now she's on back  on her kick about what teachers wear and how their hair is cut.  which is  one thing, but she's lost several teachers this month and i don't think that  alienating the other ones is a good way to keep the staff happy.  also, the  computer teacher might be looking at another job as well so that will mean  that six teachers have left since i started.  anyway... you would think that  she would leave me alone about my shoes.  other than that school is going great.  i'm enjoying the lesson this week  and grade one is going to be absent friday.  yeah.  i love them, but they do  try my patience especially on fridays.  also, i've figured out a way to get  everyone involved in class.  it's a little impersonal but since i have so  many students it is the only workable way.  they all have assigned numbers  which they have to put on every scrap of paper in every class, so i simply  call out a number and that girl has to answer the question, read, or  whatever other task it is that they are doing.  i like it better because it  keeps the extroverts from controlling the class time.  the only other thing of interest i can think of is that they are moving me  into a new homeroom.  which is good and bad.  bad since it is in grade 3/2,  the ones i'm always bitching about, but good because they are finally going  to get me a cabinet which i need desperately.  anyway... i'm hoping that by  being their homeroom teacher they will like me more and maybe pay closer  attention in class.  o.k. i'm trying to be positive, but really i need you  to pray for me.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Check out Election 2004 for up-to-date election news, plus voter tools and  more! http://special.msn.com/msn/election2004.armx
