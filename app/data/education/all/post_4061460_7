This is the first Friday of the new school year and the last Friday before the students come back. I am very excited about this school year. I have a few of the same students that I had last year, but we will all be starting out with a clean slate this time around.  I stayed late at school the last two days, so when I got everything done that I needed for this coming week, I felt no guilt at all leaving a bit early today. I finished and printed my syllabi for both classes, made seating charts (hopefully, my class rosters won't change too much now), and learned to operate the laser disc player I need for my 12th grade class. I still don't have my novels that I need for my Freshman classes yet. I'll have to take care of that next. I still have a couple days before I need them, but I'm starting to panic a bit.  I'm going to do everything I can to maintain this positive attitude. Hopefully, a positive Mr. Woods will translate into positive students. I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Cindy mentioned that she might like to go to the movies tonight if she gets off work soon enough. We still haven't watched Spiderman 2, so I imagine that will be our choice.
