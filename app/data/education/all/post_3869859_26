by the Dixie Chicks! (for once, this one doesn't have particular significance, meaning that there's no certain person I'm thinking about with this song, I just like it, I'm in Texas, it seems appropriate!)  I said I wanna touch the earth I wanna break it in my hands I wanna grow something wild and unruly I wanna sleep on the hard ground In the comfort of your arms On a pillow of bluebonnets In a blanket made of stars Oh it sounds good to me I said  Cow[grrl] take me away Fly this girl as high as you can Into the wild blue Set me free oh I pray Closer to heaven above and Close to you, closer to you  I wanna walk and not run I wanna skip and not fall I wanna look at the horizon And not see a building standing tall I wanna be only one For miles and miles Except for maybe you And your simple smile Oh it sounds good to me Yes it sounds so good to me  Cow[grrl] take me away Fly this girl as high as you can Into the wild blue Set me free oh I pray Closer to heaven above and Close to you, closer to you  I said I wanna touch the earth I wanna break it in my hands I wanna grow something wild and unruly  Oh it sounds so good to me Cow[grrl] take me away Fly this girl as high as you can Into the wild blue
