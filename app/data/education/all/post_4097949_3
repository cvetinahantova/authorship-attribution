it was the year our heavens burned.  Modern myths in my daydreams about how i would like life to be. Need versus desire for how to spend my finances in fear or live beyond my means.  i am approaching my 2nd month in South Korea and too many things have coincided with my decision to move here.  things such as empathy.  Laura feels alone and frustrated just i like i did when i was her age. Except she is in Bogota and i was not. Different mothers same fathers the difference is that we are the same in so many ways unlike my other siblings. To be a young woman her age feeling like she has grown older before her years saddens me. Was it mere money or soemthing else that kept me apart from her all this time?  i shed hidden tears and hidden truths for my sister....  ********************************************  The constant fatigue of keeping in contact with other people devours me whole. Sending an email or composing a letter shouldn't be manual labor, yet it feels like it sometimes. Why is that? Somehow i am left feeling drained with a residue of futility. It is a doubting spirit, one that threatens my ability to keep close friends much less loved ones.  The anxiety of wanderlust coupled with co-worker relations allows me to make new companions.   ....but just who are these people?  We are thrown together as some sort of motley crew etching a living while finishing our teaching contracts. Why are some of us even here in Asia? Motives aside there are some really lovely human beings here. We share drinks and anecdotes but i rarely connect with some of them as i am living in some sort of spiritual vacuum.  People come and go in this job as the seasons change and the leaves turn, yet i do not feel my part of the pattern.  Heather and Paul left for Japan yesterday, I helped them with their luggage to get it in those bastard taxis. Aaron is also leaving Tuesday, but to wander in Southeast Asia. I am envious yet, glad to be grounded for a while to save money.  Sometimes i wonder if i will ever see them again.....
