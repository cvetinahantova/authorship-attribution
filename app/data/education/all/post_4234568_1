Remember  How we touched and caressed How we longed for each other’s presence How we imagined what it would be like To be together for ever and always  Events that pass and take root Behaviour to be unlearned Sometimes - unavoidably The past filters through  Today is different – today a new day The dawning of life in fresh form Forget what is gone and done The morrow is dawning  Children laugh and play In the knowledge of security Protected from harm Yet we can only guide  Hard to forget at times What happened and what hurt Children forget without due thought Can I learn from them?  Loving life in all forms We love once more Fresh and new Another chance, another view  Use what has gone to fulfil And move on from before Renew ourselves and realise We are born again, revitalised  Touch again – fresh it is Still the longing, still the certainty Life changes but our Constancy can remain   Inspired by Christina Georgina Rossetti (1830 - 1894)
