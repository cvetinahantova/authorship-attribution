i had a nice time last Saturday because after the church service my cellmates and i had plans; actually it was not really a plan we just wanted to get a cup of coffee afterwards.      i don’t know what was so special about ‘that day’ that i was really excited, in fact I saved some money just to be sure that I will have enough.  On my way back home while riding the infamous mega taxi, I came to a realization- I was not actually excited about  ‘what was going to happen that day’  I was excited because of  ‘whom I will be with’ .   I remember a few months ago, I was really frustrated because I was all fired up (as a christian) and I wanted to have a cell of my own, spread the word of God and advance His kingdom, but what ever I do it seems like nothing would pass through.   I have invited a lot of people to go and attend our Saturday (even friday) service but most of them would always reason (if not weasel) their way out.  I have invited friends of mine but sad to say they don’t dig things like this, they told me that their schedule  would not coordinate  with the time of the church service (in fact I was wondering until now, what was God’s reaction towards that? I mean how could you say that your work/school would not be a second priority before God’s, who is your God in the first place, hmmm….).  To be honest I was really hurt when the dawn of truth arrived,  they  are  not  interested, plain and simple, according to one of the most popular  ‘pinoy’  saying  ‘kung ayaw may dahilan, pag gusto may paraan’  and the saddest thing is that I have to find out all about it first hand, but I am not going into details because I have a much more important thing to point out.  I started to smile as the mega taxi turned left to bonifacio street, because of a funny thought that came in my head, a few months ago  ‘i’  wanted a cell of my own, but what I forgot was-  Does God want me to have a cell of my own?      Funny, but last june we started a cell in adamson with my fellow Christian friends, and I said that having a cell would be my last priority because I wanted to focus more on the facilitating side, but guess what?  One of my student came to me and ask if I could give her a one to one, which of course means that she would be my cell, later that day for some reason I approached one of my female student and asked her if she wanted me to give her a one to one and then the next day another student approached me, so all in all I have four cell mates.  And I was overwhelmed by the fact that I was really stupid for  looking and not seeing .   I have been grieving a lot about my lost opportunity to disciple my ‘so-called’ friends (I used the term ‘so-called’ not because I am mad but because I don’t think we are still friends, I think we have grown apart and they haven’t been that interested to me or to the things I do, don’t get me wrong I still and will always love them but I can’t change my persona whenever I am around them, I will always be a Christian and a daughter of God) that I haven’t been sensitive towards the people around me.  I may have lost my ‘old friends’ but I have gain a  ‘family’  (spiritual family to be precise)   through my new cellmates. These are Women whom I can grow in spirit with, Women whom I can laugh with, Women I can trade secrets with, Women whom I can be moody with and most of all Women whom I can praise, worship and experience God with.  Truly, God always works wonders and I know he would always continue to amaze me, and the truth I am always looking forward in experiencing his work first hand.         To jem, charisse, shane and joan we still have a long way to go but I know that it would be a triumphant journey because you are with me and We are with God.
