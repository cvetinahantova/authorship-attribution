urlLink    taken a zillion years agoÂ  urlLink     I managed to put the picture where I want to put it. And now, this! Hah! Now, I know I didn't finish college for nothing.  I can follow directions. Yippee.   Maybe you're asking why a normal person in his right mind would want to post a picture like this.  Well, who said I'm normal? :=) If at all, this picture proves how different I am now.  I am no longer that irresponsible "istambay" who had nothing better to do but pluck his guitar, chase after girls and pester them, drink till I drop, try everything new.  I am now a father of four and a husband to a cute wife with a fresh smile every morning, art teacher, striving artist who hasn't painted in years, debate coach,  and lately, a student of poetry.   Still nothing to do today.  Just reading blogs and tinkering with the computer. I can't move my things yet as the one I'm replacing still has his things scattered on the table.  Besides, I haven't gotten my appointment paper yet so although I've already attended meetings, I don't think I'd consider it official until I received something.
