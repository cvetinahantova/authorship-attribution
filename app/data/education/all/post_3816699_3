This is mi poem,    I love this poem, perhaps the most realistic   I have ever written...    Abandoned  Pressured by the indistinctive ideas put upon me Conquered by the words you speak Take advantage of my frailty Your recognition and dexterity I do not seek  For you driven me to these extremes To not live in fidelity when forsaken You cannot wake up it is not a dream For whom the blame be taken  The fraud of myself was to be believed The fake outset to what people saw It was quite easy to keep them deceived I kept them from seeing every single flaw  They did not see it, behind all their will Shouldn’t have been judgmental, and do not relent And as I swallowed the very last pill My love will always be unsent  Abandoned by this non-existent realm The pain I never could have deemed To discount the bliss is seldom To reality it should have seemed  The darkness of the night The loudness of the softest song The dimness of the light The remnants of this throe so long  This pitiful state of which we call sane The last resort to escape the truth that be All my beliefs have been slain With the exact same sword that had killed me  My blood has dripped through these sheets And stained my skin and stopped my breath I am left here where jealousy and agony meets I may be straggled if any harder you do press  A recognizable face yet to be looked upon You’re so pretty yet you are evil in every way Your blue eyes black hair and skin so fawn You killed me ever so slowly in the harshest kind of way  You have left me lifeless and yet so pale My heart still beats but the rest of me dead Left hidden still cannot see me in this veil My blood is still blue, killed to fast to turn to red  The angel from my dreams, thought I would be saved The thought of the evil, and would be soon through Took into a small dark room, and all the walls caved To you my heart and soul were true, but it didn’t matter you killed me too  I had died for a second when I saw what you did As I am lying down denying what I had seen 1000 hearts for you would not be my last bid Have you ever regretted the past, to see what you could have been?  Standing still yet still moving Its only because you are the breath of me If I am not good enough what is the point of proving To the only door that has never been opened I hand you the key  Are you sure you want to step into my world and see? If you open this door, you will never want to leave Can you feel the desire and the strength of me? Too many people cannot get out; through out the crowd you must weave  You require a death of a sin to be accepted Be evil and you will impress us To kill and to die is how we are to be percepted Soon the pain turns to pleasure and the pleasure turns to lust...   NEVER TAKE TOO MUCH ADVIL , Tyler :P I  love  the unknown...
