Hello to all. Hope you are all doing well. I`m doing, ouch, fine, ouch, really, it`s just when I , owwy, move, oh, everything hurts. No more long distance walks for me.  I mean that thing was 2 days ago and I can hardly move my legs.  Geez.  Good things that have happened.... I made my first bento, view yonder picture.  Also, I get paid tomorow! I`m going to sign up for World Link so I can actually make long distance phone calls from my cell phone should I so choose.  Also can get signed up for those SkyPerfect TV channels of anime I have been looking forward to watching. Other good things.... birthdays...  Happy Birthday Grandmother!   She`s turning an age that ends with a 0!   Happy Birthday to my cousin Emily!
