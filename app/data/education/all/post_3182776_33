This morning I'm listening to Radio One and, unexpectedly, I seem to have missed it.  Now usually, my radio goes between XFM for the indie thing and 5 Live for the news and sport thing, and that's about it. That way, I get all the current affairs nourishment that a growing boy needs, and I get to accompany it with the angst-ridden whingy rock soundtrack that the state of the world today demands. Neat huh?  Except that I find this morning that there's a whole other planet out there, in which hip hop and r+b and slightly more mainstream but still halfway decent music is happening, mainly around the vicinity of the buxom and shiny Ms. Jo Whiley, who, after all, is a part of my childhood and deserves respect. (Nobody can pull off those long sentences quite like me, no?)  Also, it strikes me that the problem with genre radio stations is this:  When all that you listen to is your favourite kind of music, the quality of that music no longer has any relevance.   If you aren't forced to listen to three minutes of tooth-rattling Eurotrance every twenty minutes, then Radiohead just aren't quite the same band. Know thine enemy, that's what I'm saying. So I'm keepin' it locked on One for a while, just to see what the real world is like. I may restore my jangly guitar blinkers at a later date, but I feel I'll be a wiser, better person when I do.   This morning a real life hunchback walked by outside my flat. All human life is here, in Bethnal Green.   Come down. We'll have coffee. You bring the bourbons.
