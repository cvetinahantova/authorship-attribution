opened my yahoo email account this morning to notice several changes... first was interface, and then later in the morning an upgrade from 6MB of storage to 100MB...   my guess is that they're trying to be more competative with other email servers (such as the new gmail from google)... i've had my yahoo account the longest of any of my email addresses and i don't plan on ever getting rid of it... i just appreciate the significant updates from time to time. =)  end of blurb =P
