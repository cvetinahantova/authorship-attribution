The food is simple but satisfying, the Contiki crews are fun and outgoing in general this is shaping out to be a fatastic trip. Not many of my fellow travellers are boozers, or shopperholics. In fact we all seem to be a pleasant mix of what or tour manage Chris (a.k.a neo) has devised as the three sections of contikiers: Boozers, Shoperholics & Thrillseekers.
