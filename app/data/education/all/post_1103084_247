I considered giving up driving for lent last year.  The idea got poo-pood enough (for good and bad reasons) that i stuck it on my back burner.    It would have demanded a lot of bus riding (so - waiting and patience) reliance on the goodwill of friends and family (so - self-abnegation and humility) and coordination of schedules and expectations (so - talk and relationship).  BUT why go through all that when you *have* the other car?  sitting there in the driveway!?  I'm just getting increasingly convinced that when everybody responds to your ideas with "ludicrous!" and "absurd!"  --   maybe thats when you know you're on the right path...
