In a fit of haste and impetuosity (that I will probably regret later), I've created a blog.  Is it just self-absorbed navel-gazing?  Probably.  Will anyone care?  Probably not.    Maybe anonymity will work to my advantage.    Anyway, if anyone is reading this, expect posts on the usual: politics and religion.  You don't have to agree (you probably won't), but your thoughts will always be appreciated.  XP,  Chris
