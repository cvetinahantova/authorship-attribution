I sneak in here and go swimming in their pool and chill in the hottub.  It's the hilton (now radisson) in whittier.  One time we snuck in and the pool area was surrounded by a bunch of people that were dressed kind of nice.  Not your normal poolside attire.  There was an older couple in the pool, a bit loaded from sipping on mixed drinks.  "Come on in!  It's fine!," they called to us.  So we got in.  I swam around, but began to get an eerie vibe.  All the people around the pool were snacking on finger foods and were dressed in black.  Then I looked near the hottub and there was a giant photo of a woman with flowers placed around it.  I had walked right by it when entering the pool area.  Then the drunk couple began to make disparaging comments (rather slurred and loudly, I might add) about the photo and the woman, who happened to have been beheaded in a machete attack at a Ralph's supermarket in Irvine.  yeah.  I wouldn't have believed it, but I had read about the incident a few days earlier in the LA Times. I wanted to leave, but Jesse and Andy wanted to walk behind the photo and chill in the hottub.  We got in, reeling from this surreal scene that was before me.  Then andy, shirtless, barefoot, and dripping wet with clinging boardshorts decided to help himself to the snacks among the mourners.    Here's John Greenleaf Whittier for whom the town is named.
