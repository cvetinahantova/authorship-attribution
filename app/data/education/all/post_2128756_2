My Mother's garden has a certain unkempt Autumn charm about it this morning. Fallen leaves create a sort of colorful uniformity to the whole. As the sun rises above the fence, behind the big tree (I've no idea what kind), the yellow and browning leaves turn to gold, some alchemical trick of nature.   What is the truth in that?  That there is some fundamental light/energy in the universe that causes us to transcend our normal bodies and become someting else?  As I am home alone right now, silence pervades. The sound of my voice when I cough or exclaim at some mundane domestic atrocity (spilling water from the water jug, sneezing too loudly) is brash and unconnected with the moment. I have come to accept that I write and think in a voice different to that with which I speak, mostly.   I have begun work on a new musical project. Two actually. The first is a ballet that my brother wants comissioned: Jekyll and Hyde.  I have thought up a few themes to be developed into longer pieces. I suppose at some point I will have to write these ideas down on paper, but..we'll see.  The second is a musical theater adaptation of The Tales of Hoffman. It is a story about the struggle to find truth in the face of a world of lies. I am worried that it is too colossal a project, but again...we'll see.
