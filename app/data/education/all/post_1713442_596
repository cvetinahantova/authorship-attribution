urlLink Student Involvement in the Community College Setting. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Christopher A. Chaves.  From the ERIC Digest:  American community colleges, urban ones in particular, face unique challenges with their first-generation, immigrant, economically disadvantaged, non-White, and limited English ability students (Hirose-Wong, 1999). Moreover, many traditional and non-traditional students alike are inadequately prepared, academically and psychologically, for college-level work and learning (Howell, 2001). These challenges can be exacerbated by students' failure to connect and become involved in college at the level necessary for academic and workplace success, herein defined as successful completion of required course work.   Astin (1984) defines involvement as "the amount of physical and psychological energy that the student devotes to the academic experience" (p. 134). According to Tinto (1997), high levels of student involvement generally proved to be an independent predictor of gains in learning. Tinto (1987) posits that achieving success in student retention generally "hinges on the construction of educational communities in college, program, and classroom level which integrate students into the ongoing social and intellectual life of the institution" (p. 188). In the community college setting, a redefinition of what constitutes "involvement" is necessary, primarily because this non-residential constituency usually works at least part-time and, as a consequence, finds it difficult to become involved in traditional campus activities. This digest discusses three student involvement opportunities - freshmen orientation, learning resource centers, and community college learning communities - that can be critical for students' academic success.
