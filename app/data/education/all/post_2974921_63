i had a pretty nice day...  jammi called last night. and needless to say we were okay. like nothing happened. it was nice though i really miss him still. hey, these things rake time don't they?  i attended my very fist badminton practice this afternoon. i met this student named stephanie and she was so nice! i sucked pretty badly in serving so she taught me how to. and so did karla. i can't feel my arms though. but hey it was fun...
