It has been a relatively quiet day around here.   We went to church both services today, Tommy stayed home.  Watched the race, and US Open, took a nap, that's about it.  Oh, and I patched Tommy's jeans.  That was the highlight of my day, patching hubby's jeans.  TJ  has a bad habit of wearing his dad's pants.  Normally not a problem.  But, somehow, he rips them, every single time he wears them.  THey come home in more than one piece.  Tommy is down to only one pair now.  So, I got out the trusty sewing machine and patched another pair.  BUT, I forgot to change the settings and the needle so it honestly is the worst looking peice of crap I have ever done.  Even worse than the first thing I ever sewed in HOme Ec class back in high school .  That is bad.  We watched  urlLink Motorcycle Mania  tonight on discovery channel.  I can't decide if  urlLink Jesse James  is a cool dude, or one messed up man.  He definitly has a lot of rage.  Quiet rage, the not so good rage that builds and builds until it explodes.  Someone always gets hurt when those quiet ones explode.  And he is dating Sandra Bullock.  She must like the bad boys.  Real bad boys.
