Mood:  mm, sorta Hungry  Listening To:  Nothing,....:/  mmm wow, its been a while, Friday went well, English Lit test was ok, though extremely long, but I planned everything out and I hope for the best. I seem to have chosen the questions nobody else did :/  Met Jo after, we went to Marks and Sparks, then McDonalds, god some food etc then just hung out for a few hours doing litterally nothing at Figgs Marsh. I have this thing about people coming to my house, mainly because I'm sorta ashamed of it, and well only 2 people since I've started Secondary School have came round and thta was Jo when we were going out and Claire when we watched Shawshank redemption. Well at least Mum want to redecorate, though shes leaving our room to last..  mmm, Saturday was boring as I didnt do anything, would like to have met up with Jayson, but he had plans, so I just played games etc. Sorta developed a crush on him, but he'd rather stay friends, which is fair enough.  mmmm, I gotta get up off my ass more.  I dont really have much more to say, catcha later!
