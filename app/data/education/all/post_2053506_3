Awhile ago I bought yarn for  urlLink this  pattern.  Well, I found out I bought yarn that was MUCH too thin.  So today I began knitting the three scarf ruana from  urlLink this  book.  I am so happy to be knitting and doing something creative. It's moving along nicely.    Today I also purchased urlLink this  book at the bookstore.  I am still not confident enough to do complicated stuff, so I'm ok with easy for a while.
