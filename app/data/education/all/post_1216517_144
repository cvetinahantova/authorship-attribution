SKEEBALL AND PUPPETS      I'm writing a couple short films.  One is about a puppet that breaks into the major leagues.  The other is entitled 'Life of a Skeeball Junkie."  Kinds says it all, huh?  Also, I've got an idea for a documentary.  Don't steal this. I swear I'll kill you.  urlLink Skeeball .  Yeah, that's right.  A documentary on Skeeball.  I'm doing the research right now.  It'll be big.  I'm going to Phoenix, Pennsylvania, Coney Island, Vegas.  Yeah.  That's what I'm sayin', holmes.
