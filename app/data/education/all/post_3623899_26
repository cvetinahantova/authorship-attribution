Today, I ended school early.Then went to Ang Mo Kio Central[hate that place] as she wanted to buy some hair stuffs.I suddnely remembered that i forgot to bring my keys with me.So once i reached under my block, i had to wait for my mum to come back.I waited and waited.Suddenly came a young chinese man.Gave me the news paper and told me to read.I wondered why did he give me the papers.Then i realised that he has seen me there for long.So i read and waited,read and waited.2 hours passed and my sis came back.She asked me 'why are you under the block?' I said i thought mum wasn't back yet.She called my house and there was my mum sleeping.I'm such a fool not to see my mum go up by the other staircase.This is how precious time is being wasted!!!!
