I read this blog a lot, but I don't write on it much.  My life, you know, is sort of mundane.  But, I have some bad news, and since Fern was the most perfect dog ever (sorry Lucy, Annie, Harvey, et al) I had to let the world know, in at least this small way, that she is gone.  She started having seizures one day on our afternoon walk, and after four days at the emergency vet's office, in and out of consciousness, she came home with me.  She died under an elm tree on Summit Street, very peacefully, and we buried her out at Jan's (Jan at the Workshop) farm near Solon.    It's been over a week now, and I'm past the stage of being sad and lonely and tearful and sort of angry, although I still think I see her on the couch when I come home at night.    God.  What a great dog she was.   Okay.  Remember when I said I'm past that bad stage?  I guess that was a lie.  But I thought you all should know, since you all met her at some point, and experienced that big, mellow head pressed against your knee.
