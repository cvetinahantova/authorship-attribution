I got lost with  urlLink the Magnetic Fields  last night. Herbal refreshments aside, it was a fantastic show. Stephin and Claudia had some witty banter going on in spite of Merritt's series of bad pun jokes (the church they played at was unbearably hot--what with no ceiling fans and stained glass windows that couldn't open and all--so he left in the middle of the set to fetch a portable fan to put onstage after which he said "Well we thought we'd have at least one fan onstage tonight").  Opener  urlLink Andrew Bird  was another standout. I was expecting to hear some cheesy local schmo, like the performer outside the church who was clutching a Jewish "Uncle Maury" type hat while he was barefoot and singing, but was pleasantly surprised by his amazing  urlLink Murray Torkildsen  type voice and talent on the violin.  The Fields are doing a completely different setlist tonight and  urlLink I'm tempted to go again  although I don't think I will, as I'm trying to conserve money my last week here.  Best: Smoke and Mirrors, All My Little Words, I Die  I completely forgot my digital camera, so there's nothing to post from the show..sorry about that :(..but here's a totally unrelated photo from an unrelated performance..
