"to err is human, to fogive is divine" mrs. dela cruz said that earlier. it made so much sense.   then,in our THE class, we watched this film about developing self-esteem. there was this model who told the viewers the same problem i had. she said she was living a life when all of her peers are decicing for her. then she realized it shouldn't be like that. it's her life and she should be the one in control. i'm glad i'm not alone.  *** i'm in such a bad mood today that i wore my hair down as a sign of..well, my bad day. it actually looked good so it made me feel a bit better. anyway, the jammi thing has been eating me alive. i had to tell someone, so i told kuya mico. he said it wa complicated shit and so do i. it's so frustrating.  i really need to break up with him...  *** remember lyle and yang? i joined the theresian chat room in mIRC and i catched her there. turns out she wasn't mad at me and that the issue became some kinda rumor. waaahhh!!!  *** i passed the first round of badminton try-outs.
