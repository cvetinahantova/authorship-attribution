Today's pop-ups seem to imply more failure in my life:  "Failed UCAS? Try one of our online degree courses for people too stupid to figure out how to open the door and go to their local college! So easy to sign up for, and only $93482939958686 per year!"  "Hey you, fatso! Your diet clearly isn't working. Try ours instead! For just $29495930059393 dollars a month, you can't afford not to (you fat fucker)!"  Ah, how I wish I could live the American dream...  Ceff x   Nicotine, valium, vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol... c-c-c-c-c-cocaine...
