Last night, Sarah and I went down to the lower East side and had dinner at the famous Katz's deli. It is absolutely nothing like the one in Austin...it is pure New York. The counter guys are all yelling and it looks like it hasn't had a really good cleaning in a decade. However, the pastrami and rye and piece of cheesecake I had were truly the best ever.    The walls are covered with photos of famous customers, and there's even a sign hanging from the ceiling to show you  exactly  where Harry met Sally (Or more accurately, the table where Sally demonstrated faking an orgasm.)    All in all, it was a great experience. (Also, it rates on Citysearch's "10 Things You Should Do in NY Before You Die. And on that list, I now only have 8 to go, since I've already been to the Empire State Building!)   Besides that, it has been a calm weekend, which was especially needed right now. I still have homework before I go to class tomorrow, but it was so relaxing to just not do anything yesterday.   Holly, I am really looking forward to next week-I've been saving ideas for things for us to do!
