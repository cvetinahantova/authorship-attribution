I FEEL SO VAGUE today. Just can't exactly know how I feel about things in my life. Where am I going? what is my purpose though? my fears, my deepest longings? etc.  I have this feeling of uncertainty? confusion maybe? I am not sure. I cannot articulate this feeling. Perhaps because I am still searching for meaning in life or maybe because I wanted to comprehend love in its totality but since partly it is a mystery I cannot fully grasp it! Whew! nakakapagod, hay mabuti pang mabuhay na lang ako sa araw-araw  at magmahal at maging mabuting tao---tapat, kilala ang sarili---ang sariling kahinaan at lakas, ang maging mapagpapakumbaba,etc...ha ha ha.
