Monkeypants tried to hurry home to surprize me with lunch...unfortunately, I already have a job interview scheduled early early that I'm taking my break as.  :(  I'm dissapointed that I don't get to see him at lunch.  So in other news... (or here's what I intended to write about today)  Fucking Karen made nice yesterday afternoon.  And then she blew it when I got here because she'd sent me a letter telling me a) what's expected of me and b) how to do it.  Bitch.  I still hate her and I still hate the job.  Which is why I'll get a new job soon.  And on a more cheerful note, my boobs seem larger today.  Must be time for my period.  My clothes look good, though.  Started playing Tropico on Monday night....totally addicted.  I just wish my sound worked on my computer so that I could hear all of the cool carribean beats.  Had dinner with Mum last night.  It actually went really well.  No yelling or argueing.  No fighting about menial things.  We just ate dinner and then I went home.  *sigh*  I should go months without seeing her more often.  My chest feels all tight today.  (It must be from the larger boobs.)  I feel as though I slept with an ace bandage tied around my chest or as though I'd be held too tightly while sleeping.  I think its pneumonia or maybe an ongoing heart attack.  Fucking Karen says its probably gas.  Whatever.  The H*Factor went out on Monday night and met some very nice guy whom she didn't sleep with!  Way to Go!  She actually went to have dinner with him yesterday.  Even cooler.  I suppose that's everything for now...I'm sure I'll hop back on later and post again after my interview.
