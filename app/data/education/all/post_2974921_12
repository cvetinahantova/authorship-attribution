i had a blast yesterday! tito cocoy brought us to libis to play badminton for an hour. gosh i had a good time exercising. i didn't become tired right away, only after it. my right armwas kinda weakened but now it hurts[but not that much] and my butt[?]. but still i had fun. i didn't find any cuties to secretly oggle over but still had a great time. earlier that day, we went to SM to buy rackets for kuya and i. tito cocoy got a facial afterwards so kuya and i bonded. gosh, i can't believe how nice he has been to me. we chatted as we walked around. he even told me why the AHS and MC friendship bridge got closed and we finished the arcade Time Crisis II for the first time. man, i had a good time with him. last night was even weirder. he was so nice to me that he insisted we share beds. he even kind of leaning on me as we listened to his rock cd. it was like...maybe he wanted me to talk about something......  last night was also very scary. my parents called and, yes, i asked them if jammi and i could talk over the phone. it freaked me out when mama's voice lowered a little and she said in the most professional tone, "hold on". she even asked why we needed to talk to jammi over the phone.man, i was dumbfounded...
