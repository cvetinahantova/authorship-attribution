Like my new quote thing on the right? England are winning! Wooh! This is going to be as much as I can write in about 5 minutes whilst talking to Becca. I really should have done lots of English tonight - I'm pretty much regretting that I haven't been. Went to Oxford today - ok. The canteen was really good - cheap, good quality and high quantity. I recommend that the school caterers take more than a FEW leaves from their book -.-. The journeys were fun as well - it's AMAZINg how much commotion a simple Gameboy with pokemon can stir. "Oh, it's really sad that you've got that! So sad! Can I have a go?" And then later... "No! That's a  pshycic type! You need to attack it with another one like that. Use Mr. Mime. Wait, he's too low a level - he'll get slaughtered. Use a flying type." "But he doesn't have any flying type moves." "So?"  Etc. It was very amusing. On the way back we were singing lots of queen as well ("Bicycle! Bicylce!") and some more traditional songs. We had a talk about university admissions in general as well as "what Oxford could do for us" and the advantages of going there. Quite interesting I suppose. After the fabulous lunch in a very posh hall, we had some legal arguement. I started it by saying "I'd just like to let you know, that we believe our client to be completely and utterly, guilty." Then there was a trip to the University museum of natural history - which was quite interesting. Then home - which consisted of trying to strangle Sabrina, Jack and Josh. Amusing ;). As well as eating.
