urlLink I sold my soul to rock and roll .  That is all.  Training is wrapping up this week. First day of trainer observation/practice went o.k...am teaching almost all of them tomorrow. Unprepared. Better get cracking.  Move into my apartment right after work tomorrow. Hopefully things will settle down after that. Got nabbed with paying income taxes in Canada. You can't always get what you want.
