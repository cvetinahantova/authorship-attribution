Ah-ha!  It suddenly seems the system is cooperating with me.  Today's thought:   My favorite subject is me!  It is interesting that the human animal is hopelessly self-centered.  The surest way to win friends and influence people is to ask them questions which allow them to ramble on endlessly about themselves, their opinions, their beliefs, their wisdom, their hobbies, and so on.  Blogging takes this thinking to the next level by creating a media which allows each of us to pour our hearts and minds onto those hapless lives foolish or unlucky enough to wander across these pages and find themselves drowning in our own self-worship.  Something tells me I'm going to love blogging.  ;-)
