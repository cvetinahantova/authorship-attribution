Confusion swept me  off my feet and dear Lord, I followed the best of what I knew.  Emails, lunch, a spot of tv. Work, another stain from the swirling palette.   Forgive me Lord. I am a child that can't grow on her own.  Who knows why the body matures? How a child suddenly speaks when the last you saw, a trembling bundle of flesh and undisturbed rest.   Such mysteries confound me and silence indeed  makes wise the foolish.  I will return to You.   Faith guides the hands when eyes corrupted with age fail to perceive.   I will return to You.  Grace cleaves  the desires  of the flesh and through its passage,  your saints will travel  to find You.   I will return to You.  Though my senses fail, still the Hope in my spirit  man will never fail to find You.   I know how to continue this journey in darkness.  Let no other lights lead me astray.
