Hey everybody,    I now sit in an abandoned staff room with my jacket still on watching flurries fall.  This seems to be the general trend of winter days in Tohoku.  It is nearly as cold inside as it is outside and march is slowly passing with absolutely nothing to fill the hours spent at school.   Fortunately, last week I was able to escape my schools and spend a week showing my family a little of what life in Japan is about.      I travelled to Kyoto by Shinkansen and was able to be sitting on a bench patiently waiting when my family arrived on a later train.  While in Kyoto we saw Fushimi Inari which is a really impressive Temple with 1000's of Tori (red gates) lining a path up to the top of the mountain.  We also saw Kinkakuji (Golden Temple), Nijo-Jo (Nijo Castle) and Ginkakuji.  Perhaps one of my highlights of Kyoto was walking the streets of Gion on what you might call a Geisha hunt.  We actually did see about five geisha scurrying to their 6:30 appoinments which made the book Memoirs of a Geisha come to life.  Kyoto is definitely somewhat of a mystical city and it was nice to experience it with my parents and Dana!    Arriving back in Sendai, naturally it would be a bit colder and snow was falling.  It was now time for me to show the fam a little of my area and what life is like for me.  I brought my family to the boys school and I must say that the people at this school continually amaze me.  They very warmly welcomed my family, gave sweets and tea, escorted us on a tour of the building, and helped us make dinner reservations at a traditional Japanese restaurant for my family`s last dinner in Japan.  They really went above and beyond anything I could have expected.  I think my family could easily see why I am so happy at my visit school and the quality of friendships and co-worker relationships I have formed.     I also took my family to see Matsushima (1 of the 3 most beautiful places in Japan), Zuiganji Temple, Shiogama Shrine, and Yamadera which is a mountain actually in Yamagata Prefecture.  Yamadera was incredibly beautiful as we climbed to the top to see the mountains and village covered with snow.  I actually think Yamadera far surpasses Matsushima in beauty!  Of course we also spent a lot of time shopping in the various arcades and different areas of Sendai and my family spent about an hour cold and under the kotatsu (heated coffee table) in my apartment.  Another highlight was the dinners we had when my family was able to meet a few of the friends I have made while in Japan.  I think my family was able to gain a better understanding of what exactly living as a foreigner is like in this country.     I will say that having my family here reminded me of how difficult life was when I initially arrived in Japan and how far I have come in the past several months.  While I still don`t know nearly enough, I realized that I am able to speak and understand more than I usually am required to know and utilize on a regular basis.  However, what I did realize is that my knowledge of Japanese is a very practical knowledge and is based on what I personally need to know to get by without always requiring help from others.  Therefore, in terms of helping my family in restaurants, shopping, and getting from place to place my abilities were often limited.  Basically I came to the conclusion that I know what I know and that as I have tried to explain in emails and over the phone, the way things happen in Japan do so for no apparent reason.  You just have to except everything for the way it is and also accept when certain things can`t be done.  Only after living in this country for a few months is one able to see this country for what its worth and accept it just because you know you have no other option.        I do want to say to my family that it was great having you here in Japan.  I am not sure where I`ll be going next but I know I can always count on my family supporting me in whatever I choose and then coming to visit once I am there!
