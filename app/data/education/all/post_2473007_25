So often we build for ourselves a house of cards that can so easily be shaken, yet we refuse to admit our own frailty.  And still we cannot comprehend the fact that we are not the makers of our destiny.   Sometimes we create for ourselves a future.  We look through the window of tomorrow and we see ourselves enjoying our own creation of what should be.  Yes - dreams and aspiration play an important role in any person's life, but when we set them up as golden calves and begin to worship them above the will of God, problems ensue.   So where does that leave us?  Do we become fatalists and conclude that nothing can be done in our own power and therefore nothing can be done?  God forbid!  We ought to pursue that which is right, and even that which we appropriately desire, as long as we remain bendable.  The moment our desires and our realities begin to take control, there is a dangerous paradox and we become hollow and useless, having no connection with the reality of God's sovereignty.
