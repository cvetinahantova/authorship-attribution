Im so havent yet got used to blogger. I always click on the wrong link. Well just wanted to tell yah about  urlLink emode.com . It gives you a quick IQ test and tells you to what category you're knowledge falls, like me im a spatial (spatial or visual? I dont really remember) mathematician. And it quite surprises me because Im so never gonna be a mathematician, but base on what they explained to me, they were quite right. Well, I provided you the address so be sure to log-on cause its more than just IQ tests.
