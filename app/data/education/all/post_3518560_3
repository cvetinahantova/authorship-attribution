Chester started e-mailing me first thing this morning, telling me I need to go back home for a visit so he can convince me to stay and we can be together.  Riiiiiiiiiiiiight.  I told him that Mama's Boy always suspected that I cheated on him with Chester and he said I should've when I had the chance, it would've given him a reason to make the accusations.  Sorry jackass, I don't cheat!  He also said he wants to take me to Vegas, he'll pay for everything.  I still think he's married.  I sent a care package to Army today in Iraq.  I talked to him the other day and he seemed really down.  Hopefully this package will cheer him up a little.  Everyone told me to send him a Playboy, but you can't send porn into a muslim country.  Damn!    Cop's wife is getting on my last nerve.  I swear she has multiple personalities.  She's so fuckin 2 faced!  She's so sweet to me like everything's fine, but then when I turn around and she's all pissed telling him stupid shit like he's not allowed to hug me.  Last night him and I were eating dinner and he tells me not to tell her we ate dinner together because she'll get mad.  WTF???  She spends like 3-4 nights a week at our apartment, and it's a little too much for me.  When she's there, him and I basically have to argue the entire time so she won't think we get along too well, or that we're too close.  I don't want to be with him, but I want my best friend back.  Needless to say, the few nights a week she's not there are great.  Ok, time to get some work done...
