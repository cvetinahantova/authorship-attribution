This was an excellent weekend. I got to spend saturday with Michael, my very British friend. I think I scared him singing Destiny's Child but we had a blast. We hooked it up with some other emo kids and somehow I talked myself into buying the new Blink album. It's surprisingly very well done. I still have to watch how I say certain words after spending the day with Mikey, because I am starting to talk British. You know I love ya man! Today, I finally kept a plan and went on a walk with my dear friend Annen and got to see the wonderful world of Salem Academy! I need to go back down there and  try to pimp. I used to be a mormon pimp, but that kind of fell apart. Love ya guys! Check out the new Blink album, It is really good.
