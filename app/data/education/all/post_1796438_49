Shock, Horror  Oh my... English Lit was a... I don't know what it was. I don't even know what I'm thinking right now. Anyway, I might post what happens if the all mighty gods permit me so. Otherwise, you'll have to find out from everyone else. I never saw this coming.  In other news, I'm too tired to do anything tonight. I tried to do my physics report, I honestly did, but I'm so tired I think I give up. I'll just hand it in Monday. I have to study for the Chem test yet. I don't know how I'll survive exams. Nah, no need to worry. I'll rest in the day between them. Hehe. This weekend I'll still have to do my English Lit essay and Physics report. Oh... yay... ZzZzZz  5 Sleeps Until Exams
