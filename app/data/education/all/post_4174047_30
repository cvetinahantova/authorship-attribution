urlLink    Looks kinda like barf, but it tastes O.K...In my recent attempt to lose the pounds or kg's I should say, I have been trying to cut down my carbs, mainly white sticky rice (almost immposible, seeing as I grew up on the stuff) and have been eating breakfasts like this one in the picture. 6 egg whites and one chopped chicken breast omlette. I sprinkle a little pepper, some tobasco sauce, and ketchup and that's it. Couple of Jamison Vitamins, (which I'm running out of, I have to remind my sister to bring me some when she moves here), and I am set for a couple of hours. I've been going to the gym quite a bit lately, partly cause I haven't been playing hockey. Personally, I have never been the biggest fan of the gym, to me I would way rather play a sport than sit on a cycle or run on a treadmill like a hamster. Although, I somewhat enjoy lifting weights. Except in Korea, they play the worst possible music you could play while working out. I mean I love K-pop as much as the next person (NOT) but to play it as well as slow songs, is annoying and can be hazardous to your safety at the gym, as it could possibly put you to sleep, which is no good, especially while your benching 400 pounds, as I do..(another lie).  Oh yeah, Jung-Min and I went to a 찜질방Gim Gil Bang (Dry Sauna). The one we went to was really nice. It's right near my house and brand new. We roasted our asses for a while then Jung Min and I had some dinner there 낙지복음밥 (Nak Gi Bok Eum-spicy octopus stir fry thingy in rice) then I went to the steam sauna, showered and scrubbed up (this all for about 10,000won) and came home to write 3 tests for tommorow's class...Till tommorow tak'er easy. L8ter...
