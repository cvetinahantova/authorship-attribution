In preparation for my move, I have been getting all my medical issues out of the way. For instance, today I had my first eye exam ever and now I own two pairs of  glasses ! They are very cute. I will put up some pics of my new look as soon as I find someone willing to take some glamourshots. Last week, I had a physical. Next week, I will be seeing the dentist and a psychiatrist. Yep. Has it really come to this, you ask? Indeed it has.   Some of you who know me may be wondering what on earth I would need psychiatric care for.  Well, if you were ever in a relationship with me, you would know. If we are just friends, or we just had those two awful dates that spelled doom for us, count yourself  lucky . If you're a stranger, I don't know if you're lucky or not. It depends...do you like cynical sarcastic types? Anyway, I'll just say that I have been in a lot of emotional pain for a long time, and therapy wasn't fixing it (although it was nice to be able to   name   my issues for a change).  Also, my degree was in psychology. I think that officially makes me a joke.  As for the dentist, I have been advised to handle my dental matters stateside. I guess the teeth situation in Japan is something akin to the purported British situation. Not that I am slamming the dentistry of either nations. I've never been to Great Britain, and in Japan I was too blinded by  glittery eyeshadow  and hot-orange hair streaks to really notice the young people's teeth.  I am going to New Orleans this weekend for a little vacation. It's  crawfish season  and I am young, willing, and eager. Or as Hunter S. Thompson might say, "I feel a powerful lust for mudbugs." I can almost smell that intoxicating stench...
