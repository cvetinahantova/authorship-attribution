right now it's just june 18th, and it's gonna be a june 19th soon. Not really gonna post on and on, cuz it's late , and i just don't feel like adding on. Just this: In the land that is Hollywood, some things erupted, i guess. 1)P-Jax is no longer coach of the LAL. eh. 2)Kobe8LAL is now Kobe8FA. and 3) shaq wants a trade. More tommorow.
