Ever meet one of those women,you know the ones, they are attractive, have a great personality, good job, brains, not a fat cell on their bodies, but are with losers for men?  Why does that happen?  Why do those women who could have any man on earth chose to be with the low lifes that treat them badly, cheat on them, do drugs, won't work, and generally just lay on their fat lazy butts all day?  It is a phenomenon I will never understand.   I have a sister that we will call S.  She is one of those women.  Or at least she was in her younger days, and still thinks she is now.  Now, she looks like a used up worn peice of leather.    She has been married 8 times.  Yes 8.  Two times, she married the same man twice.  Only once that I can remember has she been with a man that didn't beat her, starve her, sell her, or make her do sick stuff.    She left that husband, said she wasn't worthy of him.  I don't understand.
