1. Go into your blog archives. 2. Find your 23rd post (or closest to). 3. Find the fifth sentence (or closest to). 4. Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.   ...and i quote (from December 3, 2003):  "and yeah.... this about sums it up: lkp 42 42 42: i'm going to spontaneously explode and you're not"  (footnote: saw the above instructions in someone else's blog -- out of curiousity looked up what sentence that would be in mine, and then saw the complete appropriateness of it to this week... how much fun is that?)
