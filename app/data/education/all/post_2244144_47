The now defunct archives of this blog used to carry something that I feel very strongly about. That is the whole same sex marriage argument ( urlLink Missouri, being the first in line, has banned this type of marriage ). Now most believe that the argument is for or against the banning of gay marriages across this nation. I believe that to be complete blasphemy. The third option on this should be for the government to deregulate marriage.  One of the fundamentalist qualities of this democracy is the separation of state and religion (now that is not what the republic was for, but that a whole other topic). Now can anyone please explain to me why the government regulates the holy sanctuary of marriage?  The only reason why a person should get married in this country is because of the tax benefits that belong with it.If this were the case, the majority of the people in this country would find marriage a waste of time. Now you could say that people want to adhere to their religion, but lets face it people, the majority do not follow their religion too wholeheartedly. Just take for example the percentage of people that have pre-marriage sex. That is not condoned by any major religion, but yet the overwhelming majority does it.  So again, I must ask why is marriage still regulated by the government? Please if anyone has an answer to this, post it in the comments section. I will be intrigued by the answers to this.
