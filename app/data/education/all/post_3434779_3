OK... well. Im Kirsten, I live in northern Maryland, and for now I am 14, But my birthday is soon, so yay! I am a freshmen in high school, have blonde hair, blue eyes, im 5'7" and weigh 111 lbs.  Today I went to my friend Billy's graduation party, its so freakin hot outside and humid. I coulda swore I was gonna die of heat exaustion. Well anyway, I convinced my dad to bring me home to my moms house, I told him it was too hot outside, but really I just wanted to go next door to see Johnny (who by the way I have been totally in love with for the past 2 anda half years). So i came home, got a shower and then went next door. but he had a double hitter in baseball, so he wasnt home yet. Then I remembered that it is my friend Aimee's birthday, so I came home called her, when I got off the phone with her I went back up to johnnys, he was home. so we just hung out. it was so gay cause his stupid freakin family wouldnt leave us alone. like normally we actually have fun (if you kno what I mean ;-D) but today we didnt do anything at all. I was mad. then I went to go home at around 10 because it was my curfew, and his parents wouldnt let him walk me outside, so I didnt even get a kiss goodnight. I was soooo sad because I have been looking forward to seeing him all weekend when I was at my dads house, and then we dont even have fun. It was such a waste of time. But oh well, at least I got to be with him for a few hours. Well its getting late. I have to go to school tomorrow, walk around with johnny in the morning, be my normal self, sit with johnny at lunch, he prolly wont even talk to me. err. then come home, eat, cuz i wont eat at school, school food is so nasty, and hell i will take all the lunch money mom gives me and pocket it. then tomorrow go to johnnys, as usual, and maybe even get some action like normal. im gonna knock his brother out if he bothers us all night again. well. goodnight!
