I'm not the way i am today.. Perhaps due to the lack of sleep haha.. Last night slept at 1.30 a.m.. At least, it's better than Caifong.. Pity her.. Slept at 4 a.m.. But nobody can beat Deny.. Sleeping at 5 a.m... Might as well don't sleep right? Wonder what guys stay up late at night for.. **don't wish to know** :P Didn't get into Ambassadors.. Damm happy about that.. Now i have the excuse to say that i can join other ccas.. Kinda interested in dancesports but somebody doesn't like me dancing with other guys... Ha ha please lor it's going to be more girls than guys in the cca..  As expected.. LOL..       ..*-Promise me you'll be there when i need you-*..
