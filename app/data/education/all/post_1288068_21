The boy did indeed rescue me from the BIGGEST MOTHERFREAKING WIGGIN this side of the river. It was about to use its horrid pincery wigginy ass to take a chunk out of my foot and he manfully captured it in an ingenious trap made only from an iBook and a jar of houmous. Gra would have used a shoe to mash it nauseatingly but reassuringly into the bedclothes, but not the boy; he is a veritable patron saint to all wiggins. It is in the bin now, feasting on chickpeas and slowly suffocating to death. Soon it will fall into a painless garlic-scented sleep, never to wake. Damned dirty wiggins.  The only good thing about this incident is that it allowed me to say wiggin every hour on the hour for an entire day.  I have my TTA skills tests in ICT and numeracy on Tuesday. It will be nothing short of a miracle if I pass, considering I am almost completely innumerate. Seriously. You don't believe me, do you? Care to make it interesting? My spell checker says that 'innumerate' doesn't exist, which ain't great news for my literacy test. Wonderful.  I have taken v trippy Lemsip Non Drowsy Sinus Capsule analgesic. Now I can't get  Surrey with a Fringe on Top  out of my head. Wouldn't be so bad if I knew the words. Currently goes    Chicks and beans and ducks better hurry When I get you out in my scurry  Wiggin get you out in my scurry With the THING on top   But changes every thirty minutes or so. Nice. Chris fairly stoic in the face of nasally-intoned Broadway hits.  I think I should go to bed.   Bugger, back to school tomorrow. Goodnight. x
