Does anyone give a shit about the Indy 500 by Scott  Maybe in Europe, due to the amount of money put into speed by the automakers there.  I actually have been to a 500 mile formula one race at Nap Town's Motor Speedway. I went in college and was bored to the last second. I couldn't even get beer because i was 20 years old. Every thirty seconds or so, for 500 laps, the cars zoom by while people yell and spill their beer on each other. I'd liken it to 50 thousand people watching as someone tries to get an busted Nintendo to function.  NASCAR, as a result of its puzzling popularity in the tailgatin' South, has taken over most of the television rights and ad sponsorships of professional racing, which the Indy used to dominate. I'm not saying boo-hoo, I just wonder, culturally I mean, how certain sports fall out of the popular opinion. Like, say, no one ever gave a fuck about the America's Cup, but I can remember a time when I would get excited about seeing a professional heavyweight boxing fight. Now heavyweight boxing has disappeared in the American sports lexicon. There's no more "Watch out for Mike Tyson!" or "Look at old George Foreman fight!"
