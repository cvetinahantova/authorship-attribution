The last few days I have been wondering, “what will I do as a job when school is over?” some of you may know, I go to ISU (Idaho States University) and am majoring in American Studies with the idea of transferring into the ISU Teacher-Education program.  Well I found out I may not be a good teacher, as in doing it by all and myself. Long story. I have been trying to figure out what I can do.   Well, tonight in study (Jay’s group), the lesson we watched talked about the job Jesus held, working with wood. It seems that wood wasn’t used a lot back in his day. By looking at the buildings and household things, and ect., we call see everything was made of stone. Jesus was a stone carver. Now that was something to think about?  Well, by talking about Jesus’ job, I began thinking about what I will do as a job.  *What skills do I have? Well, skills are learned in school and are given by God. All of my college classes are in the areas of Teacher-Education, Political Science, Literature, and History. I believe God has given me the natural ability to break down things that is hard to understand and to make it simpler. I do not know for sure.  *What is my calling? I know my calling has something to do with the “youth.” I always thought I was meant to be a Youth Pastor. Even helped out at my church with the Youth Group when I was 1st saved (age 15) and even became a Sunday School teacher for some teaching the high school class over at the church.   *What is my desire? Well my desire is to follow Jesus. I want to give Him everything. I love to teach others and help them to learn.   I am still trying to figure things out and will let you all know when I figure it all out. I just need a lot of prayer on this issue.
