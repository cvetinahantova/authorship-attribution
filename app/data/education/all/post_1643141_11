I am currently greatly stuffed. I haven't been eating, well... often. Actually I have forgotten to have dinner two days in a row. And I have been sleeping even less than that. Thank God for makeup!!!

Anyway, have just been going through the motions. I have gathered a volunteer for recommendation; and now I just have to update my CV, edit my BA paper into perfection, and ask one of my old professors for another. Not that I don't need to ask yet another three (yes, a Grand total of 4!) for law school recommendations. 

Right now I am really tired... . I am going to bed.


Topic of the day: We are all equal under the law, but we are not all equal. Big, controversial subject, yet one I find to be rather true.

Sideline Topic: Where have consideration, curtesy and manners gone?
