Testosterone Cream?    urlLink But hey , as the article points out, there's no evidence that Bonds, Sheffield, Giambi et al, actually  used  the stuff.  You can't prove that it wasn't, say, purchased for their wives.  Or children.  Maybe they bought the cream for their kids, you know, like when your dad makes you chain smoke a whole pack of cigarettes as a lesson.  Or maybe they rubbed it on their heads like so much bryl cream.    More than anything else, this situation continues to merit a hearty "what the fuck?".
