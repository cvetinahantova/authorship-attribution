Seasons do change. This doesn't happen in California. It's quite strange. Life remains vivid in the death of summer. Some toss around baseballs and footballs while others lounge on the grass. A lovely scene.  Couples cutely walk through the autumnal bliss. Even Ezra and Andrew seem happy today. Their statuesque figures are warm and free from nature's torment, minus periodic spiteful birds. Life's curveballs lose their movement for brief moments.  Anxiety aggraves unpleasant pathologies within my digestive system. I feel evil forces again. They're latent instead of overt. The conspirators can't come here to get me because they're already here.  I try to move my mind back to the place of youthful innocence. Angry joggers take me away from it periodically on my walks. The pleasantness of this situation is a very tenuous equilibrium.
