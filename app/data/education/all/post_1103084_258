Lynn and I had a weekend rendezvous at a little hotel that we've returned to regularly since our first stay 12 years ago during our honeymoon.    when we got back to Gramma Glo & Bampa Bill's house where the kids had been staying and playing with their cousins --   urlLink     Patty (a longtime family friend) had arrived to provide Jaelyn and Addison one of the highlights of their vacation...   urlLink      urlLink     a ride on her Harley...  otherwise we've been:   1.) celebrating hundreds of birthdays,   2.) building a huge fence,   3.) reading a (very) little,   4.) swimming a (very) little.  5.) chillin with Aunts, Uncles & Livermores.  &   6.) looking forward to heading north to the cabin next week...  in completely unrelated news, but utterly worthwhile to think about...  More info (including pictures) about  urlLink The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe  has been released.
