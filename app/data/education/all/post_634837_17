1 Corinthians 15:10  But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.   taken out of context.  i stand at the edge of the pool, toeing the water, dipping my ankles, shuddering from the cold:  Not miles but mere metres before me. i don't understand olympians with their ostensibly strong and rippling muscles, blades that dance across the  surface while, my body  continually breaks the ice and lets the cold in.  i stand in a pink trimmed, sequinned black suit, pale as sickness.  one moment the plunge, that will end this monologue. one more moment the plunge from they say, darkness into light, buoyancy, the thrill of going back and forth while your spirit races to  the finish line.  Just one more moment to be more or less human: But for the grace of God.
