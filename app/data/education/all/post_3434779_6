OK, its like 11:30 in the morning and I am still in bed. Thats really not even cool. What a waste of my day! lol. Last night after I wrote that long entry, I was really bored so I went into a chatroom, and there was like ten 15 year old guys so i talked to a lotta people it was really neat talking to people that I dont know. Like when you dont know someone, you can be anyone you wanna be. But its sorta rude to lie, so i just act different. Very preppy i think. Its all cool though. Then at like 3 when i finally decided to go to bed, I put in a movie. "confessions of a dangerous mind" its a netflix movie. I didnt watch it all cause i think mom woke up, and i have this kinda rule that when mom wakes up, i go to bed. so yea. I am thinking that I will put a song or something in here in a little while. I dont know why. But I just sorta feel like it. I do know one thing though. I need to get a shower, re color my hair, and go chill with sara today. I am so bored. umm. i guess thats it! well ttfn!  I love johnny...........
