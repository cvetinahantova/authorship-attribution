My boss decided to have a Wine Party this weekend.  I made Spinach dip, but couldn't find Sour Cream to make it with, so ended up using Yogurt(yuck)with Japanese mayo in one and Yogurt(yuck), cream cheese(that wouldn't soften enough) with Japanese Mayo in the other.  They turned out alright, but not my best by far!  Everyone liked them, so that was good!  I am not a wine drinker, so I was the only one drinking beer!  OH yeah, B one of the other teachers was drinking "NO" alcohol beer(we found out that is what Japanese call Non-alcoholic beer here, as we were trying to buy it for him at the liquor store!)  He was drinking it for the first bit and then had wine later on.    Almost everyone stayed until 2:00AM and everyone had plenty of drinks!  I'm not really the party type of person and I would have preferred to stay home but figured it would be good to get outta the apt!  Thought maybe there would be someone new to meet, but nope, same people!  How can people drink so much wine!!  It's tastes awful!  Although I guess my opinion isn't everyone's!!  Most of my family which includes, Aunts, Uncles, Cousins and my friends enjoy wine!  Must be an acquired taste! :D
