I saw it - wasn't surprised - learned a few new things - not sure I can trust what I learned - saw a lot of stuff I already new - couldn't look at the war victims - cried for my baby sister who will be going to Afghanistan within a year. My reactions will make the woman who lost her son look like a cold-hearted bitch if anything happens to my sister. I've spent most of my life trying to protect her, watching her back, making sure no one who isn't me or my siblings hurt her in any way. The helpless reality - KNOWING she is going, HOPING she'll come back. My only consolation is that she isn't going to Iraq, but I certainly don't feel better.   My reaction was mostly disgust. I just watched a film that may or may not have portrayed my President in a fair light (I'm inclined to think he's more idiot than evil, more spoiled rich kid than elite conspiritor) - but certainly established the fact that our world is madness and chaos and there is no reasonable solution. At this point voting George W. out may or may not make things any better...the option is not so appealing either.   Kerry: "Americans are playing by the rules while a whole group of people are writing rules for themselves and leaving the rest of America out of it,"  urlLink Kerry said . "We're going to change that around. Help is on the way."   Does that actually make sense to anyone? Who is 'the group'? If Americans are playing by the rules who are 'the rest of Americans' being left out? Who does that leave making the rules for themselves? What rules are we talking about?   He skips the vote on DOMA, after promising to be there, to spend time campaiging. He is as indecisive as Bush is over-decisive. What's worse, a president who can't make decisions and goes along with the flow or a President who makes the wrong decisions and goes against everyone?   Amber to Jen (after the film): It's time to buy an  urlLink island .
