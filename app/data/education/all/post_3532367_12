After having dropped the girls off so that they could go on their organised day trip, I went down to the bank to pay some of my Saturday job money into the savings account - along with the refund, I am now back over the 1000 UKP mark.  Next up was the cycle shop - it was open, they fixed my gears while I waited and charged me 4 quid! Bargain! Even if he did close early on me yesterday.   From there I got home and found the batteries had gone flat in a piece of equipment I use. I asked Sandra if she would fetch some for me as I had to be out in 30 mins and still needed to get changed - she agreed. 40 minutes later, still no sign of Sandra. I told my son to jump in the car and phoned work to ask them to cover me as I would be 15 minutes late. Half way to work, the phone goes, it's Sandra "where are you?" she enquires. I tell her how I needed to get off and that she would need to come and get Rob off me. She slammed the phone down.  I arrived at work 15 minutes late, there was cover, but everything was OK. 15 minutes later Sandra turned up, handed me the batteries and took Rob home, without muttering a word.   Now I felt like the one who had been put out, I was OK about everything (even though I was flustered, I wasn't angry or 'down') yet it was Sandra that was in the mood - why? OK she went out for me, but knew what time she had to be back - she had gone in plenty of time and should have done it easily.  Nevertheless, I have come back to an empty house, which means I can't go out and get the parts for my car service, as I have asked Sandra to only give me cash for things. As she is not here I have no money, and the shop closes in 30 mins....
