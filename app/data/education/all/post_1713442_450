urlLink New Copyright Exemptions for Distance Educators: The Technology, Education and Copyright Harmonization (TEACH) Act. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Carrie Russell.  It looks at the TEACH Act.  From the ERIC Digest:  With the recent passage of a new law eagerly-awaited by educators, the same type of copyright protected materials that a teacher would ordinarily use in the physical classroom can now--in general--be used in the digital classroom. The "Technology, Education and Copyright Harmonization (TEACH) Act," which President Bush signed into law on November 2, 2002, amends two sections of the U.S. copyright law that educators rely on when using copyrighted materials in the classroom without prior permission from the copyright holder (Section 110 on exemption for performance and displays and 112 on exemption for ephemeral recordings). TEACH expands existing exemptions to allow for the digital transmission of copyrighted materials, including on Web sites, so they may be "viewed" by enrolled students. However, in order to take advantage of the exemptions, educational institutions must meet specific obligations outlined in the law. This ERIC Digest outlines both the privileges and the requirements of TEACH.
