Now I'm on evacuation alert.  I truly don't believe that it will ever come to being evacuated but who knows.  There are so many houses between me and the fire.  It's a wild night.  We're all sitting out front in the driveway, watching the flames on the hillside to the south of us.  During the day, it's so smoky you can't see anything but at night, when the trees candle, it's an unbelievably scary show.  We have a full house tonight.  Mom and Rod in the guest room, Andrew and Stephanie in Angie's room, Angie and Vanessa and Jacklyn on foamies in the living room.  Ernie hasn't been taking any of this seriously but he said he will start moving some of our stuff over to Jen's place tomorrow.  If we get evacuated, all of us will ahve to find places to stay.  Either at Gordy's or maybe at Jen's.  Guess I should go pack something.
