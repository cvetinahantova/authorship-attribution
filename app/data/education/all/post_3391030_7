Hey!!!! gosh it's been so long! i know i said that in my last entry but it really has! i've been so busy lately! i've hardly been home that much! This week is vbs(vacation bible school) at church and morgan and i volunteered for the nursery and we are with the 6weeks to 10month olds! ya haha they are cute my favs are hunter! (such a cute lil boy... he's gonna be so cute when he's older) and then eleanor and victoria! eleanor has been the one i've been holding the most lately lol.. boy i never realized how tiring it can be to watch the babies! i took a nap yesterday and today when i got home! lol but i do have to get up at 7every morning so that may have something to do with it lol! but ya and then afterwards we've been goin places and doin things and such but it's been nice! i don't have to sit at home all day... oh ya! and guess what! my Cousin Jason is supposed to be comin home(not here just to the us) for about a month from iraq! so so awesome! dad gets to go see him but we can't go which sucks but oh well and mom is tryin to get my to go to west virginia with her for her family reunion but i dont' wanna go it's to freaky cuz my great aunt and uncle used to live in that house and they both died in it but now mom's two brothers and sister live in it and that's where we would have to stay! and it gets like pitch black in west virginia and you are out in the middle of no wear about 20 mins away from everything or more! all you have is a gas station down the road so you better not forget anything while your in town! and besides that nobody knows me by my name they know me by mom's daughter or kermit's granddaughter (my gpa) but ya enough blabbing! ttyl lyl!
