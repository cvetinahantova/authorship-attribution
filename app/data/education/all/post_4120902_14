As I Look into your eyes I see all the reasons why My life's worth a thousand skies You're the simplest love I've known and the purest one I'll own no you'll never be alone My baby you Are the reason I could fly And cause of you I don't have to wonder why Baby you There's no more just getting by You're the reason I feel so alive Though these words I sing are true They still fail to capture you As mere words can only do How do I explain that smile And how it turns my world around Keeping my feet on the ground I will soothe you if you fall I'll be right there if you call You're my greatest love of all you are the reason i can fly and bescause of u i dont have to wonder why my baby you,theres no more just getting by because you're the reason i feel so alive  MY BABY YOU by Marc Anthony
