NOTE:  This post shocked a few "readers," so be forewarned that 1) it's not something to read at work and 2) I think it's  funny  and I will not cave to the censorious J-Ho Jackson militia!  Okay, read on:  Recently RuPaul published (on  urlLink his blog ) what he called his favorite fan letter of all time. Here is an excerpt that will surely haunt you after reading. Please note that I have actually deleted the NASTIEST BITS in favor of the funny bits. It was 50% longer than what you see below:   Dear RuPaul,  I don't even no how to beg-gan. I am not gay or bi-sexual, but even though you are a Drag Queen, you are so sexy and lustful, I can't help but masturbate to you. I masturbate to your sexy website, I masturbate to your sexy music videos, and I even masturbate to the nasty, pulsating beat of your music...I want to dress in drag myself as sexy Lil Kim as we suck each others hard and juicey cocks.  As you can see Ru, I love to use the word BEGGING a lot. To me, BEGGING is something that's very sexy. Not standing on the street corner BEGGING for money, (unless you are a sexy prostitute or hoochie mama dressed in skimpy booty shorts with a matching halter top and shiny leather thigh high boots with six inch heels and a sexy hair due, sucking on a big deal pickle, Begging for a trick).   Believe it or not RuPaul, but I'm your biggest fan. I dream of having freaky sex with you everyday. I would love to meat you and fuck you one day. If not, then I guess I will just have to continue beating my hard and swollen dick into a soft and sribbled nub, and you don't want that do you?  Your biggest fan, Billy Bee / Billy The Beggar
