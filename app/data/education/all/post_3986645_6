Another uneventful day. How grand! What better way to celebrate the passion of boredom than to create a blog? You tell me.       I've sat in this chair for the better part of the day, aside from a brief and fleeting trip to the supermarket to buy light cream ( How can one live without the proper accoutrements for coffee? ) and a bottle of lotion ( Burt's Bees; Milk and Honey. Absolutely divine ).        Also, I cleaned my room. And by clean, I mean straightened up. Things shifted from one shelf to a drawer, and from desk to box. Orderly looking on the outside, but really only hidden piles of junk. Not to say that all my junk is stowed away, but at least now it's... slightly better.       Tomorrow looks to be as interesting as today.       I would highly recommend the book  The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit  by Storm Constantine, but I'm only a short way into it. So far it proves to be excellent reading, though.       I wish I had more to say for a first post.. Oh well, I suppose.       Thank you and goodnight.
