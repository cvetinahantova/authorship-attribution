one of the most pleasing things on this little planet is to sit on a paint-peeled park bench and watch geese waddle by talking among themselves as they go.  what do they say?  i haven't a clue but i know for a fact they they become most offended when i try and listen in.  one thursday a gander attacked me for no apparent reason or provocation.  i was halfway offended but (relating back to yogi) i realized and took into account our speciesial differences.  The gander may have had a hard life.  perhaps a poor irish immigrant brought up in brooklyn going to the school of hard knocks.  sacrificing for his family-mother and seven siblings.  trying to make ends meet.  giving up his last nickel for milk when he'd rather go to as picture show.  losing his sweetheart on account of long hours in the shop and the resulting crankiness afterwards.  an abusive father who died young on the shipyards and the overbearing mother impossible to please.  all this came to a head with my eavesdropping.  i can understand.  this ain't a perfect world.  we gotta cut corners somewhere.  but God bless America and thank God we're still alive to tell about it after that God awful war with the germans.  at least we're still waddling
