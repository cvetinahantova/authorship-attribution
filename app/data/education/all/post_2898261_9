Take me there where The sky is shimmering of a flourishing shuffling Dance through the night Magnetic sparkling of heavenly colours So spectacular so striking so bright Take me there where white drifts glittering like crystal and ice is the colour of the moon Where the Artic wind drifitng in the night is like the stars of diamonds shivering of cold Take me there where I can listen to silence to the place where my spirit grows far up north Take me there where in the bitter winter night I can call someplace  our home.
