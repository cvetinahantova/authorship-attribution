Hi everyone.  The evacuation order for my area, the lower Mission, has been lifted today. It sure feels good to be back in my own house although everythign stinks of smoke and the pool adn yard are black with ash. We are still on one hour evacuation alert but it is extremely unlikely that the fire will have any serious flareups in our area. However, I won't be unpacking anything yet and we'll leave all the stuff over at Jen's until we are off alert. It is still threatening the southern area of the city though and we aren't out of the woods yet. The forecast for the next two weeks is hot and sunny. Why won't it rain?  The city has arranged for buses to take the families of the burned houses up on a drive thru of their neighbourhood so they can have some closure.  They are hoping to open up the area to the rest of the people by the weekend.  My brother and sister and I are hoping to be able to go on the bus with my mom today so she and Rod don't have to go on their own.  She is doing ok over all but it has already been such a shitty year for them with Rod and my Grandma's health declining, and my mom's cancer. Ugh. I feel so bad for them. They've been to the insurance people and are happy with the way things are going with that.  They are planning to start building as soon as possible, not sure if they'll be able to get it started before winter sets in though. They are going to stay with us until October and then are moving into a a one bedroom furnished motel suite until the house is built.
