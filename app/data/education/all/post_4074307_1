I seem to have a lot of random thoughts floating through my brain at various times. And I'm very, no make that VERY opinionated, so I thought I would try putting them to paper, well, virtual paper. So I will be commenting here on things of interest to me, such as politics (Vote Bush!!!), living in the People's Republic of NJ (thanks Governer McGreedy), sports (The Yankees are not evil, the rest of the owners are, and I can prove it!!) and whatever else comes to my brain in the middle of whatever I'm doing.    If you're reading this, thanks.  Hopefully I can come up with something thought provoking somewhere along the line.
