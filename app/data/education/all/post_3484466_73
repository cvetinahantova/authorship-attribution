Just drove up to Albertsons and got donuts... yum  Got mom McDonald's for breakfast, and was inquired about my driving privileges by the espresso stand girl on the way back. That was interesting.    Anywho, gotta love those maple bars. They were on sale, too.    Current Music: Paul Oakenfold - Someone Like You
