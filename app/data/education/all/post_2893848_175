Suck It, Yankees   All those muscle-bound, steroid-fueled assholes couldn't get the Yanks past Wakefield and the Sox last night.  Unbelievably, Pokey Reese (.192) is off to better offensive start than A-Rod (.189, 0 for 4 last night, and, in a symbolically appropriate play, caught stealing). Okay, the offensive numbers are pretty comparable in this small sample, but at least Pokey gets to play shortstop.  And  how  .  Nevermind that Pokey's numbers are only mildly disappointing, whereas A-Rod's are decidedly not good enough.  All I can say is:  Suck it.  Wake looked great, and anyone who thinks this guy was ever in need of  urlLink redemption  is missing the point.  We love that bastard and his confounding knuckleball, a whole lot more than anyone hates Aaron Boone, a grudge that seems to be a media invention more than an actual groudswell.  Aaron Boone?  Despite Fox's insistence last night that my most hated Yankee be either Bucky Dent, Aaron Boone or George Steinbrenner, I feel about Aaron Boone pretty much the way Pedro feels about Kareem Garcia:  Who the fuck is he to deserve my attention?  That game last year was lost before Wake ever took the mound, and certainly before Boone hit that home run.  (Anyway, I can think of five or six Yankees that I hate more than Boone but, inexplicably or not, weren't an option.)
