I don't really have much to report.  By this afternoon, Dad felt well enought to go to the game.  I emailed Shawn and he was so sweet about it.  He said that he wanted to go to the game, but he was glad that my dad felt well enough to go.  What a honey.  I asked him if he wanted to hang out this weekend, and he said that he did.    Dad only made it through 4 innings.  It was really hot where we were sitting, and his legs were cramped, which isn't comfortable for him since he hurt it.  Then, right after he ate a pretzel, a woman with really strong perfume sat right behind him and the smell was making him sick.  His nose is really sensitive when he's on chemo.  So, after the 4th, we left.  The Phils were losing 5-3.  Of course, as soon as we got in the car and on the road, Burrell, Abreu, and Thome hit 3 homeruns in a row!  I felt really bad for Dad, because he was trying so hard to stay there for me, because he knew I bought these tickets especially for him.  At least he got to see the new stadium.  Well, I'm super duper tired, so I'm hitting the hay now.  'Night everyone!
