I am taking a quick lunch break at CLP and found a computer with an internet connnection.  This morning, we had a staff meeting, where everyone introduced themselves.  About 1/3 of the teachers here this year are new.  Jay and I introduced ourselves along with the rest of the teachers.  I was pleased that numerous teachers, paras, etc. came up to introduce themselves throughout the morning.  I will go into a little more coverage of the morning meeting later, but must first discuss what happened shortly after the meeting.  We were meeting with our cooperative teachers in their rooms when Brian Williams, the new principal at CLP, came on the intercom and demanded an "all staff" meeting in the media center.  Guy, my cooperating teacher, said, "Either something is wrong or something really bad has happened."  Once we were gathered in the Media Center, Brian announced that Myron Bird, a CLP math teacher for more than 30 years had died of a heart attack on the way in to school this morning.  Everyone was stunned and many were crying.  This was to be Mr. Bird's last year before retirement.  The mood in the school went from one of excitement and anticipation to one of shock and dismay instantly.  As it turns out, I may have seen the accident on my way to the schoool in the morning.  I had no idea at the time what was transpiring.  Being from outside of the school, I feel a little out of place, but I can feel and understand the emotion and the feelings.  The school BBQ that had been planned for tomorrow's lunch has been cancelled and it almost seems like the wind has gone out of the sails for our school.  More later.  What a day.
