Well, after a nice float down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho, and two weeks back in Seattle, I’m ready to start keeping up with my blog again. This will be short, since I’m working on the job hunt. But so you know, there are new pictures on the   Picture’s page  , and I’m slowly starting to think about getting my Israel pictures up. I’m not quite sure how I want to do it, but when I figure it out, you’ll see the pictures. So many people have been asking for them, I might just put them up and make it look nice and pretty later. But for now, enjoy the pictures of happenings around Seattle.
