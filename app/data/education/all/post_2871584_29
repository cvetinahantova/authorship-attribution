Today was another incredibly productive day, although in a very different way from yesterday.  I woke up this morning with an idea for a story in my head.  I got up, sat down at my computer, and started typing.  Three hours later, I came up for air, and to grab a glass of water.  I ended up writing an entire short story today, something that usually takes me at *least* a week.  And the best part?  After leaving it for a few hours, and coming back and reading it, I still like most of it, which is even more unusual.    That took up a good portion of my day, and now I feel like I have... nothing else to say.
