We went to the  urlLink Liberty , a lovely restored old theater in incipiently hip downtown Dayton, to watch Spielberg's  The Terminal , the Tom Hanks film.  The film was much better than I expected--a very kafkaesque nightmare of a central European mensch trapped in a modernist bureacracy.   There were also some fascinating Spielbergesque moments as well. In one scene, Tom Hanks is expressing his love to Catherine Zeta Jones, and the image is just full of glowing shining light, like "E.T." And ultimately, the film is about going home, just like "E.T."  Interestingly, jazz played an important role in the motitavtion of the Hanks character.  Still, it wasn't a masterpiece. Many characters just didn't add up. The guy who ran the airport seemed to verge on the irrationally sadistic at times. And Catherine Zeta Jones's character was infuriatingly self-centered.
