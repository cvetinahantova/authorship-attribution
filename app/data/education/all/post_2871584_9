It's Friday, and what a Friday it is.  I got a lot done at work today, but it was one of those days that just flew by.  I had meetings from start to finish, but they were productive.  Then, right before I left my office, I checked my voice mail in my room.  (Why I didn't wait three minutes until I went to my room?  Who knows.)  I had a message waiting from Pratt, saying that they want me to come to campus for an interview!  I actually screamed after I listened to it.  I'm so excited!  I called back, but as it was already 6:00, they were gone for the day.  I left a message to call me back on Monday, so I guess I'll take things from there.  Now I have to sit down over the weekend, and figure some things out.  How much do I need to make, what kind of benefits do I need?   What am I willing to accept, and what can I just not afford?  I'm willing to take a pay cut to go there (I don't believe I just typed that), but it has to be worth it to me.  My goal for doing this is that I want to get my Master's.  If they can help me do that?  I'm there.    In other news, it is officially Valentine's Day.  Woo.  How...utterly not exciting.
