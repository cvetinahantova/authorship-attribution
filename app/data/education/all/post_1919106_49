"And here we see a geek in his natural environment..."   Yesterday Charles, Richard, Evan and me hauled some partitions from the warehouse into the lab and put them up. They have Plexiglas windows and look really neat, and now the room is very silent since we put all the servers behind the partition. We can finally talk to each other without yelling.  Today we spent most of the time setting up the machine names and installing Debian clusterwise... We still have problems with mosmon not seeing anything... And some of the machines don't have all the necessary libraries, so some binaries are broken. I'm going to have to reinstall Debian on those.  In the meantime, Philip finally got the Cisco router working, so the Netgear one is unused now. We might bring it out again when we get the laptop so that we can use the wireless hub.  Finally we had some fun with the partitions... Whenever one of us would go in to work on the computers (that would mainly be me or Evan) the rest would go and say "And here we see a geek in his natural environment. Oh, he seems to be upset about something! And remember children, don't feed the animals".
