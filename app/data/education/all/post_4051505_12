i haven't been on blogger for a while so i decided to make an effort and write something about something. i haven't written something about anything in 10 days...long time. tonight meg, sara and j are coming over for a sleepover at my house which should be a laugh. yesterday we went shopping, which was fun. no more swimming in streams at the moment, the weather has gone wrong. i think it is due to a hurricaine thingy but i don't know. i was up at 7.33am. i am tired. i think i might go back to bed.
