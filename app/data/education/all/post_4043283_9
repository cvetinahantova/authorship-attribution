Countdown: 306 days    Well, SLA's finally over. I'm so sad! Hehe. I have bruises on my hand from playing chicken with  Ben . Good times, good times.    Today was a really depressing day, but at the same time, everyone has really learned a lot from SLA and we're all glad to have taken part in such a wonderful experience. ^^ I know I am. I'm really going to miss the class of 2004, but...well, there's always e-mail and such. ^^    Moving on, this is a poem titled "Only At SLA" and it was written by  Stella . ^^ I thought I'd share it, coz it's really cool. Hehe.    "Only At SLA"   by  Stella Kim     Only at SLA will students rise and face all four directions to pledge allegiance.   Only at SLA will the principal nearly expel you for not counting loud enough.   Only at SLA will we hear the words "open the door" ten million times the first day.   Only at SLA will we pay nothing for admission and then pay a fortune to eat inside.   Only at SLA will we be reminded everyday to turn in baby pictures but people will still forget.   Only at SLA will we snap our fingers and hit our desks and call it the weekly clap.   Only at SLA will we end at 12:19, not 12:20 or 12:15, but 12:19.   Only at SLA will a virus allow you a minute to save your work before shutting off your computer.   Only at SLA will we find out the secrets of getting into Standford but find out that UCSD is a reach school.   Only at SLA will the ethnic delight dinner consist of 90% Asian food. Another 5% is soda.   Only at SLA will we wear name tags every single day for seven weeks. (You'd think we would know each other by then)   Only at SLA will we hear stories of saving birds, pregnant women, and sideway elevators early in the morning.   Only at SLA will we write about hwo much we love our friends in our last critique and then beat them with our self-portraits the next day.   Only at SLA will we make friends quicker than we ever did before and sincerely be sorry that school is over.
