I took a look at a few of the fine arts field trips.  COOL!  I wish I had this resource when I taught a fine arts class.  I could have let my students explore and learn the things I was teaching.  Instead, I had to dream up ways to teach them.  I think I will email this link to a friend of mine for her use.  These tools make taking a "trip" outside the classroom a little easier.  It is a MASSIVE undertaking to take a field trip.  The planning, the paperwork, the approval, the forms, the discipline, etc.....I could go on for a while.  These virtual tours allow students similar experiences right at their fingertips as opposed to getting on a bus and traveling somewhere.  Besides, some of these tours take you to places that might otherwise be unaccessible.  BC
