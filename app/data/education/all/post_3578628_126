ok... i can totally see ur point kevin... but josh i think u have to realize ur unusual... obviously u were blessed with 'rents that care s0o0o much and family to be s0o0o0 much into the whole family thing. Urs has not been split up by divorce, adultery, remarriage, and massive family additions or ne other random thing thats splits them up. so0o0o i think you could be a little more lenient on y some people dont believe in God as much as you do... and u should not blame neone for not giving themselves entirely. or try to tell them that they are doing something unholy or "giving themselves" to God and then sinning. And then blessing someones family who ur having a quarrel with b/c u dont think he is doing the right thing. I appreciate and admire you for standing up for God and ur family.  Kevin... i think ur taking this way outta hand. Theres obviously not a big enough problem for it to be ragged on entirely. its a difference of opinion thats it.. he believes in something that u dont entirely agree with and thats what makes life interesting and you should know that better than anyone.. thats what makes movies go... thats what makes them interesting thats what makes entertainment go altogether. S0o0o i think that u need to accept that ur bad at planning things (although i give you props for trying,b/c ur right no one else is giving the effort.) and just move on and be the best friends u can be with someone that u have awkward situations and sometimes little spats. i love u both.
