Ok all, this is the sketch.  The job interview took place yesterday at 2.15 as planned.  I managed to turn up on time looking smart (thanks for lending me the suit Rose) and trying to look like the kind of caring, sharing, yet competent person you might hire to teach traumatised refugees.  The questions were all reasonable enough (what attracted you to the post, how do you think teaching asylum seekers would be different to the work you did a la Sore-Bum - my dad's choice phrase) and I think that I answered sensibly and intelligently enough.  I even had a few questions ready to ask at the end just so that I sounded like a real keenie beanie (and I am - it's twenty grand a year remember?) so now I just have to wait.  They said they'd let me know today or tomorrow so obviously I've been on tenterhooks ever since I woke up this morning, trying to stop myself from thinking that Fate has dangled this opportunity under my nose only to cruelly snatch it away again.  This is honestly the kind of teaching I want to do - I'm not all that interested in working in a language school (although I will if I have to) as more often than not they can be real cowboy outfits and from what I've read and heard I probably wouldn't get more than 14,000 a year even in London.  I did my best I suppose, it's just I hate having to wait, I'd rather just know one way or the other.  Grrr.  I want the job, I want the job, I want the job - GIVE IT TO ME!!!!  On my back to Yarmouth tomorrow morning in time to sign on (oh, the glamour) - hopefully not for much longer.  Will keep you all posted.  Pray for me - or alternatively, call Camdem Jobtrain and tell them just how good I'd be at getting scrounging immigrants off the dole and into gainful employment - oops, sorry, was briefly possessed by the voice of my Dad there...
