*Sobs*  Gramma has cancer.  I told you she went into surgery right? They found cancer. She's still in the hospital, apparently. My father knew but he didn't even tell me or Shelby until last night.  We were watching " Last Comic Standing " and a commercial for  Pirates of the Carribean  came on. Dad and I are going to go see it tonight, but my mom asked me if I would rather wait until cousins Brad and Meghan came to visit in two weeks. Then my dad said he wasn't sure if we would still be meeting them if "something happened."  Then my mom asked him if "This was something you had discussed with the kids."   Shelby and I were both chorusing "What? What? Tell me!"  "Gramma has cancer."  Now, I have no idea what he meant about "something happening" but I don't think it is good. Now both dad's parents have cancer. Aunt Theresa, Kassie, and Ben are taking care of Grandpa. I'm scared. I love Gramma...I love her house, I love her pancakes (panercookins), I love her smile, I love her laugh, I love her rice crispie treats....and I love her.  *Sobs*
