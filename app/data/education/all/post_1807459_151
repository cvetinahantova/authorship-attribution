What crappy weather.  I had no work today and it was really pretty awesome.  I got plans made for traveling.  Gumi James and I should be flying out on the 26th of May.  I also hit up Homeplus and got some stuff I needed.  I need to get milk on the way home.  Something I forgot to mention was that on Saturday when I had to bring Gyeh-son back to get her comp, I saw the new guy going into the dorms with Chantel (sp?).  This being at like 1 in the morning and he leaves in Bang-chon.  Hook up?  Who knows.   Never a dull moment in Korea I guess.  I have no work tomorrow also.  I'm trying to think of what I should do.  I'm thinking day trip but it really depends on the weather.  There is some stuff I'd like to do in Korea while I have the time.  I'd like to make it to a few other cities just for the heck of it.  I still need to get to Jeju island  but I think that might happen after I get back.  Or maybe not.  If I don't got I'm sure I'll still  be able to live a happy life.  Ok I'm a little pooped so I'm going to call it a night and try to get some sleep.  Until next time.
