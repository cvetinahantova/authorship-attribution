Adriene,  I love your essays and I could easily relate to most of your experiences,especially those that have hints of angst. Keep it up. I love reading your works so much I make it a point to access your website whenever I have the chance.   Another thing, I would like to dispel your idea that no one misses you. Yeng and I do miss you, big time. As I have said, I havenâ€™t seen anyone yet who could compete with your infectious smile, those wide grin that makes your eyes almost invisible. Even until now, in my memory, I could still picture how you smile. Call me biased, well, admittedly I am, but next to the Petronas Towers, your smiles should be declared as another national treasure. Truth is, I remember Malaysia fondly not so much with its nice sceneries, yes those too were quite impressive, but more than anything, it is the warmth and the friendship that you, Raymond, and the rest of the MPYs extended to us which made Malaysia quite dear to our hearts.So, much are we separated with distance, for what it is worth, we miss you.   Youalways  have friends here in the Philippines, and we would love to have you back anytime--but hopefully in the soonest time possible.Take good care of yourself. And I heard that you are celebrating your birthday. Hmm. That makes both of us Aries. :)Cheers,Chris
