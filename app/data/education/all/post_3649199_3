In Memoriam    First, I'm going to keep this short. Right now I wopuld just like to say that this blog was a response, sort of, to the death to the late great Ralph Wiley. Much props to Wiley. Much props.  ------------------------------------------------------         Basketball   Woo-hoo! Woo frickin' hoo! The Dee-troi Pistons won the NBA Title! The two people who make out beautifully (get minds out of gutter) in this situation are 1) Pistons owner Bill Davidson, who has won 3 titles in the last years, as in owner:The WNBA Detroit Shock (eh), The Tampa Bay Lightning (In florida-Lewis Black on the daily show said it best: They won the cup ina state with no natural ice!...The French Connection i guess, are supposed to be the next Sakic/Forsberg|Yzerman/Shanahan.No hockey next year. ), and the creme de la creme [or whatever]the Dee-troit Pistons, winning the First Title for the NBA's Eastern Conference since MJ/Pippen's Bulls. Anyways, time to break this dawwn. Kind of.     1.MVP:They've said it everywhere (I,Max, ATH, PTI)..this guy exemplifies team play...the MVP needs to go to every player, etc. I say Chauncey Billups deserves it b/c he made that crazy lay down-in the air-and hit it-OT forcing 3 in the East semi-finals. And he's that good, when he know his position.     2.Darko:Darko has more NBA championships than LBJ23, Melo, and Wade combined. Ha.     3.Leastern Conference:With the balance of power shifting to the East thanx to the Pistons, The East will no longer be so miserable. Here are some reasons: 1. NJ:Not that bad of a team, just needs a big guy. 2. CLE:With prodigy LBJ23, they can be grest. They just needa true PG, we all know this. And i say Z can be a good big man. 3. DET:They aren't that old, and the Lakers look like they're heading for  '98 Bulls-like Breakup, starting with P-Jax. 4.MIA:a reformed Odom, underrated 'Melo, Caron, and street ball legend Skip to My Lou (rafer alston). 5. OrL:Maybe...if they keep T-Mac, get a coach, and draft Okafor.         4.quick history:since the 2-3-2 format was instituted in '85, DET is the first team to win the middle 3 games. But you knew that.         5. Quote from the game: D.Fisher-"They just wanted it more". Thanks for the cliche, .4 Do we really need the cliche, .4? Huh?         6.P-Jax: Did you see P-Jax's kids at the Press Conference? They were all matched wih the clothes...and all looked like they were in the basement,not having jobs. Hope kids are cool with Pops dating a former pinup. JW.That was very good writing was it? No.  His quote on coaching next year for the LAL: "I'd say there's a pretty slim chance of me returning". OK. go to Alaska again...cuz this is what i see happening (though it's a longshot): MJ-CHI buys a team , and then hires P-Jax as coach of that team. other stuff naw.          Bias   Knoxville,TN isn't a college town. It's the town of the UofTN football team. If they actually cared about the UofTn it would be hi-larious! But that's not going to happen. Luckily, I'm going to be going back to where I;m from--Chesapeake,Va. Some things:Va is a commonwealth not a state, it'sa city near VA Beach (home of the Neptunes production team/N.E.R.D.), and it's not neccesarily the 'South". South of washington? yeah. But so is Delaware and a large portion of Maryland. Ok? great.              Bagels   Quote of the Week:"If you go to a house of Worship, you are more likely to vote Republican.
