The last post was actually made on the 12th but I did something wrong and so well it posted it today! Anywho. I'm gonna try to update this as often as I can get online but with my lil brother hogging the computer we'll see how often that is!   I went off roading today! And it was seriously off roading not like Teri's experience through the grass median on the highway! Brandon and I were over at his friend Larry's and well Larry decided he wanted to so we followed. He said he never got stuck and my car should be fine.. OK! Larry's vehicle is a lovely Ford F150! And so knowing me and Brandon.. the dumbasses that we are.. we followed.. For those of you who don't know i have a 98 Prizm. It held up just as well as his pickup! I had mud and grass everywhere, on the sides on the roof inside the car (the windows were down). It was soooo fun.   Anyway! I guess that's it for now! Peace!
