Just taking another minute to talk about pay to play. Pay to play, although it is a good idea, in our case, will be unfaily administered. Pay to play will make all South Sports, including club sports (Crew, Sailing, and Field Hockey) to pay fifty dollars to play to cover expenses.   Sounds fair right, they will only make you pay for part of the cost, wrong! In the case of club sports you have to pay more than the school even gives you. Take crew for example. Each rower receives a total of twelve dollars from the district*, if I only receive twelve dollars from the school, why am I paying them fifty. In essence I am paying for someone else's sport. My money is probably thrown into funds for football equipment, does that make any sense. If I'm being forced to pay fifty dollars to play, at least fund me fifty dollars.  Tell your  urlLink Superintendent ,  urlLink Superintendent of Business Affairs ,  urlLink Board of Education ,  urlLink Principal , and  urlLink Athletic Director  that you think pay to play is unfair, and don't just say that, give them an elaborate reason so they don't just think you're some idiot, they won't listen to you.  *That figure is from the 2004 School Board Election Debate
