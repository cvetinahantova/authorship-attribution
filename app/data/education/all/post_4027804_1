It is pretty wierd, that lately, faces that are new to me, I feel like I've seen them before. Today adds more thought to one I met only yesterday; I know I've seen them from somewhere, yet it is my first time meeting them. Pretty wierd.  School is actually a bit more...welcoming, than it used to be. I guess that, regardless of my experience at being the "new kid" it still remains the same: I hate the fact that I'm in the presence of people I do not know, or understand, and so, I remain to my normal self (if you know how I am) and until I learn more about the "others" I am not free with things, such as talking, or acting (I usually doze off to a sleep because of boredom).  Anywho, it just seems as if I'm here to help people understand me more, heh. Honestly, the only one who really understood alot about me doesn't know  everything,  so good luck.  By the way, I almost got into a fight with a redneck driving this oversized 6 wheeler (or something; I didn't count the wheels) who almost hit me and an acquaintence while trying to cross the street (on his red light, as well as a walk light for pedestriand) which should have known that you can't stop in the middle of the crosswalk. Yea, I challenged him out, so he got out, put his car in park, but since my friend didn't want to start trouble, we didn't have any fun...  Honestly, I would have gotten a nice hurting from that idiot. He's pretty big, but I'm sure my bud and I could have taken him. Too bad though, I forgot to get a license plate...
