Okay, I think I am getting a hint on how it feels to be a female. All these mood swings and such are killing me. It's all supposed to be worked out in like 2 to 4 days. It would be nice to have anyone who believed what I said about my problems. It would be nice to live like a normal person or have people who wouldn't talk crap behind my back. I'm not gonna be all pissed off at anyone though. I love you all and I forgive you and hope that you forgive me for my stupid crap as well. Don't worry if I keep my distance, I probably need it. Love you all.......... pray for me.   Oh and my grades in skool are great now. A's and B's like it was in elementary school.   You can tell us that it isn't serious And you can tell us that you'll do it right You can tell us that you've got it all worked out You can tell us that it's all for us But we know you're lying through your teeth You can tell us that it's for security And you can tell us it's for our own good You can tell us that we wouldn't understand, and you can hide behind your practiced grin But we know you're lying through your teeth You will bare the brunt of liability It will be a stone around your neck, drowning you in irresponsibility, underneath the weight of your regret You can sell our secrets for your benefit You can toss our bodies in the ground You can ship our children off to battlefields You can wipe the blood from both your hands You can tell us that it's indisputable, as you throw away the evidence But, we know you're lying through your teeth You will bare the brunt of liability It will be a stone around your neck, drowning you in irresponsibility, underneath the weight of your regret.  The Juliana Theory rocks my socks off.
