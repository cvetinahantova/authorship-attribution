Well, hello there again. It's a rainy Tuesday afternoon and I'm feeling more than a little braindead after yesterday's incredibly long day. We got back at about 9pm but, bearing in mind that I hadn't actually been asleep before then, I was aching all over, covered in bruises and deliriously tired. Thankfully a good nights sleep seems to have put paid to all that, although this morning I was doing my very best zombie impression. A good day at work. My classes (except my lower year sevens) were really well behaved. Bizarrely, my year 9's responded very well to the classical music I played them (I want them to write a story in response to 'O Fortuna'). They really enjoyed it. I guess they never really have the opportunity to listen to it at home. My year 7's, though, were evil. Not my good group of girls: they're always nice, but the rest of them were pains! I made one girl cry by shouting at her (of which I am not proud) and also made another girl clean the whole classroom after she had been messing about (which I am proud of). One lad said to me: "Miss, would you ever throw a blackboard-rubber at me?" I replied of course not. When he asked why I thought I'd play Miss Nice Teacher and said "Because if it hit you it might hurt you and that would upset me." He thought for a second and then added "and I'd sue you." Nice. Incidentally, he's one of the worse behaved kids in the class. It's always the badly behaved ones who bandy around veiled threats of 'I'll sue you' if you so much as say anything to get them to calm down. Funny that. After school my two 'writer' students came to see me. Dan has written an excellent short story, which I fully expect to see published one day. Considering he's 15, he is very talented. I like mentoring those two. It feels like I'm passing on my few remaining pearls of wisdom.
