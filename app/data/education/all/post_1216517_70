i went to seattle. it was a jayna present. it was fun adventure to the max. we scared trevor with stomps and music. i played basketball. i climbed up a mountain. i ate gizzards (almost). i showed a long island ice tea who was boss. it is not alive anymore.    i wish i had a karate fish. i dream he is my friend . cause if i had a karate fish. your life would hit the end.  karate fish know how to fight. they chop your face to death. they kung fu your fu man chu and sodomize your breath.  beware mere mortals of the ninja life that lives in water and carries knives that num-chucks your mama to the dirty trees and hijacks your bunghole with a hive of bees.  that inflicts your life with metaphysical pain and proves plato's grand myth of the cave.  because.  karate fish will whip you with chains then you won't be feeling so brave.  eh, wise guy?  huh?  what do you think about that?  not so funny now once the ninja fish shows you the kar-ah-tay, huh?  he is the master of the chop to your face.   KARATE CHOP!!!
