got this email this morning from my 4th grade teacher and laughed my head off:  "With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the moment it is worth reflecting on the death of a person which almost went unnoticed last week.  Larry LaPrise, the man who wrote "The Hokey Pokey" died peacefully at the age of 93.  The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin.  They put his left leg in.  And then the trouble started."  (it's a joke... laprise really died in '96 at age 83 as per  http://www.fff.at/2002/03/02/hokey-pokey-creator/ , but whatever)  in other news: current memphis weather?  temperature of 97F, heat index of 118F.. calling cotton farmers for 3 more hours, then going swimming!  woohoo!  later dudes :-P
