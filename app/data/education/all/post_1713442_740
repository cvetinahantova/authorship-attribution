urlLink Eisenhower National Historic Site (National Park Service)  This includes a brief description, photograph, and printable travel guide of the president's Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, home. It is produced by the National Park Service.   From the site:  Elvis gyrated and McCarthy railed. School children ducked and covered, suburbanites dug bomb shelters. Everyone loved Lucy, and a retired general in the White House played golf and struggled to keep a third world war at bay.   This is the life and the times reflected in Eisenhower National Historic Site, the home and farm of General and President Dwight D. Eisenhower.   Located adjacent to the Gettysburg Battlefield, the farm served the President as a weekend retreat and a meeting place for world leaders. With its putting green, skeet range, and view of South Mountain, it was a much needed respite from Washington. With its show herd of black Angus, it was a successful cattle operation and source of pride for the President.   Follow in the footsteps of President Eisenhower and his many guests â€“ Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, President Charles De Gaulle, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Governor Ronald Reagan. Tour the home, grounds, barns, and cattle operation, preserved as they were in the days of the burgeoning civil rights movement, beatnik poetry readings, and pink tail-finned Cadillacs.
