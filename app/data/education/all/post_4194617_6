Today is the second day of a "severe smog alert" here in the City of Roses. I could see it, taste it and even feel the weight of it on the drive home from Salem - a brown haze that obliterated the views of the mountains, reminded me of L.A., and caused me to want to drive like some kind of crazed fiend to get out of it and stop contributing to it. The sick thing is, our air quality is still rated "good". Compared to what?! I shudder to think.  Nothing sours my psyche more, because I've always felt a slightly smug little spark of joy knowing that the air quality here has always been better than most other places I've lived in my life. It is due in part to a series of 90+ degree days - another thing people don't think about when they imagine Portland. But, an arid desert we do become each summer. It is normally a coolish green city with lots of trees and fresh air and more than its fair share of misty rain.   Simultaneouly, and perhaps even more frightening, global warming is being blamed for the new dead zone that covers an alarming range of Oregon coastline. Everything in its path is killed due to oxygen depleted cold waters that creep up from the deep. It's kind of like all those deaths caused by earthquakes near ancient lakes that are filled with toxic gasses trapped near the lakebed an held in place by algea.   Yuck. I've got to find a job that allows me to walk or bike to work.
