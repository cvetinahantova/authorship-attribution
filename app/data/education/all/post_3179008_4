Today is feels like it is going to be one of those days. I haven't had one for about a year, but I can sense it coming on. I am tired, tired of, and on a tear. I am concerned that I may damage relationships with kids, and possibly staff. I can usually "compartmentalize" my feelings, and self process (self-soothe). Not finding the desire or will today, at this point.    Lots of heavy sighs  Creeping, closing eyes  Isolating to avoid  Black and ugly void    Top Ten   Things That Roast Me   Politics  Deadlines  Apathy  Passive Ignorance  Greed  Power Trips  Violence  Arrogance  Belligerence  Pain
