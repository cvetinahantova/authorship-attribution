Would you believe my brother has been receiving pre approved credit card applications already filled out for himself. What a waste of paper. He's similar to me, won't get one until he gets full time work, which is about three or four years away. I heard a British bank had to apologise after sending a credit application to a thirteen month old baby recently. Talk about ridiculous. Wonder who created the concept. Should go back in time and shoot them. Speaking of time travel, i'll have to post my latest musings on that. been wondering a lot recently....
