You know what? Blogs don't have to be all-criticizing of social experiences. I've sure as hell read a lot that are. But I feel the need to give some electronic shout-outs.    What about the guy who made it possible to record things on the digital tip? Thank you very much Dr. twentyfirst century. Now I, as well as anyone else with acess to a  computer can record their own music with a somewhat decent sound. I'm not implying that their music will be decent, but at least the technology for hiss-free recording is available.    by the way- check out Datathoughts.com, the DRugs are the new up-and-coming band. They'll get in your face.
