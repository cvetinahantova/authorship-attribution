a rehashing of my salute to eggers  by scott  i think my point was that irony is so enmeshed into what it means to be human these days, i think there's no way one couldn't avoid its mechanisms. this is not sad; it's a  historical result. that said, what makes eggers king of the lit landscape is not his inclination toward irony, but his earnestness with respect to it. the idea that somebody being earnest to avoid being ironic yet being perceived as ironic is maddening, mostly because the meaning gets lost. eggers is a "great writer" not because of his writing, but because of his appropriateness to the culture of today. eggers is a genius, but not a rebel.   as for your dislike of irony pete, i say that you must sit until the world changes, until exposed nipples aren't news, until sports anchors shut the fuck up, until women stop cutting their hair like "Amelie," until people have identities that aren't pastiches of cheap jokes and "makeovers." you'd be sitting for awhile. you can build a meaningful aesthetic movement around irony, the proof's in the pudding; aesthetics only have meaning now in the context of non-aesthetics, in the incongruity. that's a movement. it's part dada, part seinfeld. as is the case for anything with meaning, it's beautiful and people are left nonplussed.   jedidiah purdy, age 24 in 1999, wrote about irony and hope in his book "for common things." like most discussions of irony it makes your head hurt and leaves you wondering whether or not we as humans actually can have meaning, or if meaning itself is a deluded concept we created because we don't trust ourselves or our creations. if you lock a 24 year old educated boy in a room with a computer, he will awe himself silly. this is our movement.
