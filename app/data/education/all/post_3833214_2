Yesterday was spent in the hostel for the majority of the afternoon, playing cards with randoms and basically havin a real good laugh.  We have new rules to 'piggy' (now renamed 'snatch piggy snatch' )    The evening was spent in Marconi's, an Irish bar.  Gem and I made 'snap dragons' out of the place mats (do you remember those from school?  where you fold a piece of paper several times to make a movable folding toy with numbers and colours written on them, then finally you pick a number to reveal a statement or a dare...?)  Well, we made snap dragons for people in the bar, including the waitress and had a good ol' giggle when her dare was to serve the next customer pretending she had a nervous twitch.  Oh, how we laughed...!  Today, we walked to the Colleseum and had a tour around there.  It was the most magnificent building, totally huge and thanks to Russell Crowe and Gladiator, we didn't have to use our imaginations too much in order to consider how it would have looked when it was in full use.  Then we strolled up the palantine hill and saw the Roman Forum.  After that we went up to the Capitoline hill and saw the Ancient Roman palaces.  We were both very impressed with our guides, who were very knowledgeable and also amusing in their re-telling of historical events.  We would both heartilly recommend it to anyone.  It was an amazing trip.  After this, we walked to the Pantheon, then the Trevi fountain and finally the Spanish Steps (132...we counted as we huffed and puffed our way up to the top).  Tomorrow we really hope to visit the Vatican (we couldn't today because we were not wearing the correct attire) and for tonight it's just an early night, so that we are in full form for tomorrow.  Our feet are aching (we've walked miles in our lil' flip flops today) and truthfully, we are just ready for our beds!  Carolyn and Nicky, you'll be pleased to hear that Gem and I have earned 2 marbles apiece out of a potential 2!
