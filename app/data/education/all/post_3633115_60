Thank goodness that tomorrow I get to return to my home, and my regularly scheduled blogging.  I really dislike having to be "sneaky" about my blogging so as to avoid having any family members come and read over my shoulder and shit like that.  I mean Jeez! I'm not a child on the computer, I'm an adult doing whatever the hell I want to.  Back the Fuck Off already.  So I thank you all for your patience.  I will be blogging more regularly and less in the middle of the night so as to escape prying eyes.  Then, I will never speak of this again.  I have had less than 12 hours of sleep in since Thursday night.  I am so fucking tired that I am using profanity like a sailor.  I, generally, avoid cursing because Shorty picks it up much to easily.  I should also note that I am having a severe problem typing right now and cannot keep my thoughts straight.  I will now go to bed, and will leave this house to shop at  urlLink Ikea  before heading to normalcy (is that even a word?).  Thanks for sticking around during the turmoil.  I will certainly do my best to leave all the drama behind me and soon!
