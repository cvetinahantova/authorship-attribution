Men with guns just walked past my house!! Not the usual rifles, but hand guns - tucked into their trousers. Life is bizarre.   Just got in after singing away in a karaoke. Sing sing sing I went. It was very nice! I had a great time. I am very sleepy now.  Today: Man selling inflatable puppies - who buys this stuff??????? Particularly while they're driving down the road!  Also: Saw two small boys pushing a drinks cart piled high with stuff down the motorway. I wonder where they were going to?  Thanks for your comments. I did leave Al Rehab to have a more interesting social life and to be closer to Ancient Egyptian stuff. I can see the pyramids when I am on my way home from work you know!  Made friends with a man who teaches soldiers how to fight properly in tanks. He's Egyptian and so he is also trying to teach me some Arabic. He said my Arabic was very good, I don't necessarily believe him!  Anyway, goodnight to one and all!  Rosie
