Yesterday I went to go see "Troy" with my buddy Jeff.  We started talking about movies we had seen recently and I realized that I see a movie almost once a week.  In the last month or so I've seen "13 going on 30", "Mean Girls", "Van Helsing", "Shrek 2" & just yesterday "Troy".  Now those are the movies I've seen in the theater, I haven't taken into account the borrowed/rented/purchased DVD's.  Think of all that money that has gone into seeing these movies, prices ranging from $5.50-$8.50 each time.  Now is it that I am so into movie culture or I just have way too much time on my hand?
