There's been so much going on.� I just started moving into my new house on friday.� It is in a very cool area in Uptown Whittier.� It is a 5 bedroom house and is about 100 years old.� It's got hardwood floors and looks really cool.� There's 5 guys living in the house now, but there will be 7 or 8 in the fall.� Im really excited about it.� We are just a few blocks from a really cool area with a movie theater, internet cafe (where Im at now)� record shops, restaurants, clubs, everything all just blocks away.  I also started a new job on monday.� I work from 2:30 pm to 1am in a warehouse.� I work for a industrial supply company and Im on the move team.� They added a third level and move all the material up there.� my job is to unload the forklift on the third floor.� I have to wear a harness in case i fall.� I like the job.� i work with some of my friends from biola and make 12 dollars and hour.� I wouldnt work the job normally, but it's good money and i need to save up to go to europe in the fall..  graduation was cool, wish you could have been there.� you kind of were because I tacked a picture of you and me at my high school graduation to my hat.�   Sorry that I havent written more.� The last few weeks have been hectic.� I've been nervous and stress and not as reliant on God as I should be.� But I've been going to Grace Brethen of Long Beach for a while now and im trying to get pluged in now that I cant lean on biola any more.� i might even try to work with the high school group.� my friends matt and billy go there too, so its a good community.  im only gonna be working angel games on the weekends.� next up is dodgers last weekend of june.� if you don't know, lakers and redwings are the champions in their respective sports.� 3 in a row for LA.  i�wont be using the credit card anymore.� i guess i need to be financially independent now.� ill transfer the car insurance when I come home the end of august.  I'm a little scared about life on my own, but i'm pretty excited too.� Thanks for preparing me. �without your guidence, i'd be lost for sure.  i miss you and hope you have a good father's day.  �  love darren  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
