Ok so tonight I rented,  Dance with Me  and just let me tell you that I want to learn how to do all those Latin dances they were amazing! I get so excited when I see stuff like that it makes me want to go and dance. I kind of know how to dance but I would love to learn the proper way instead of my own made up way if you know what I mean. I think I am going to do all that I can to get into shape then I will go and find a place to learn dancing. First though I have to do a lot of Taebo and maybe some of Darren's Dance Grooves, yes I bought that. I thought it would teach me more hip hop dancing but they only show you like one dance and it's not even a whole song. I wish my Sharon were here because this would be something that we could do together. I know her and Wes have tried dancing before and that's awesome. Well I am off to go dance the night away, bye!
