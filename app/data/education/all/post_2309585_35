Had the first rehearsal last night for  Not Picture Perfect , which was sooo fun! Details are in my  urlLink other blog .  Anyway, Andy worked late yesterday (10 hours) so he could come in late today and get the car situation straightened out. So, we get there at 9, and the place isn't open. So, we go across the street to McDonald's for breakfast. About 9:30, we go back to the mechanic's and it turns out that he's not there, but his assistant is, and the assistant can't do anything for us. So, Andy worked late and went in late for nothing. He was pissed. So, I have to go back this afternoon and see if I can do anything.  The auditor at the bank still hasn't contacted us. I hate to have to do it, but I may have to get Dad to throw some weight around. If I try to get things done, I'm a whiny little b*tch, but if Dad does it, people listen. ::sigh:: I'm just sick of not knowing exactly how much money we've got in the bank. These are the kind of things I sort of NEED to know! ::roll eyes::  ::dragging!:: Need caffiene! So sleepy! Must type theater history paper and read for production class! Want sleep!
