Hi, there! I finally decided to start my own blog, and since this is my first post, I probably won't be saying anything too extraordinarily interesting today. But let me briefly share with you some of the nebulous ideas I have had as to what my web log may encompass.    I know that many bloggers use their pages as a forum for their own thoughts on current events, politics, and the like, and in so doing, cultivate discussions on those topics among their readers. I suspect there will be some of that here as well (or at least the first part, 'cause that's  my  task here). Now, do I really need my very own personal soapbox? Hmm, well, I don't believe there are a  great  number of issues that easily trigger rant-mode with me, but there are certainly a few that do set me to frothing at the mouth, and assist me in attaining a certain stridency of voice. So I think it is somewhat comforting to know that I have an outlet to go to when such topics arise. I assume there will also be some of the requisite journal-type entries  , day-to-day stuff, observations, musings, and what not. All of this seems pretty standard of the typical blog.    But what I'd really like to see my blog evolve towards is a kind of catch-all for any writing that I'd like to do. If I get some response (or at least, some  traffic , which I realize will take awhile), I'd like to post some fiction, including short-stories and possibly some poetry. The thought of doing so makes me a bit nervous, as it has been a long time since I seriously sat down to write, just for the sheer pleasure of the act, and the art, of writing. The satisfaction of creating something unique is a sensation I long to recapture. And I thought that this medium may help me down that path, so here we are!    In closing for today, I would like to thank you for dropping by and reading my post(s). Please always feel free   to post any of your own comments or feedback, and   I hope y  ou will retur  n to read more!
