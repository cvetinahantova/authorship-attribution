........ t.v. ........  honoring a long-standing obsession (which i've grown very weary of) i watched the premiere last night of the Real World San Diego.  the obvious critique to offer is:  could this "real" world *be* more about sex?   but i'm bored by that critique (much like i was bored with the sex storylines in the show last night), it seems to me that most of the time when people are freaking out about the amount of sex in the media -- they're kind of freaking out because they're so scared of it.  like it (sex) has this amazing amount of importance and sway over them.   which it does.  for me too.  but the objection against showing it -- when its clearly so much a part of the human psyche?  c'mon.  anyway.  the thing which I  DID find really interesting was this quote (which i'm only kind of getting right) by the character Frankie (STEREOTYPE: highschool geek, openminded piercer-tattoo-esque, porn-shop working, but i have a boyfriend back home + INTERESTING TWIST: has cystic fibrosis):  "I've always had this dream of moving to a new city and getting to reinvent myself completely."  The world went into slow motion for me. It seemed SO right on.  This is TOTALLY the mythos of most emerging Reality Programming, isn't it?    and its such a particular now kind of fantasy  / dream / myth too, eh?   premised upon a globalizing culture and a leisure class whose identity is formulated primarily by consumption habits...  i know that this blog hovers dangerously close to my front burner, and don't you worry, i'll definitely be ranting about it in my Mass Media class this semester.  If anyone sees any writing (articles, essays, blogs, books) about this emerging fantasy -- i'd be grateful...
