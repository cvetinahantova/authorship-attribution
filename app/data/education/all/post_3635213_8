Saturday July 24th I gave Laura a surprise Birthday party.  She turned 23.  Laura had never had a surprise party before so this was a great experience for her.  She had NO IDEA that it was going to happen, which is amazing cause Laura is the kind of person to find out about EVERYTHING.  She could shake a present and tell you what it was or just guess about a place that you are taking her by using logic and reason.  Her boyfriend Justin was in charge of getting her to Shelly and Matt's house.  He ended up just blind folding her and telling her, "Oh I'm on the freeway." and "Oh I just stopped to trick you."  When she got there she was very surprised!  She loved it!  We opened presents, ate cake, and played games.  I used the free  urlLink  evite   site to send out the invitations.  What a success!
