Could You Repeat the Question?    I'd say President Bush is a master of rhetorical misdirection, but that would imply that his efforts are not transparent.  I guess that just makes him a slippery liar, huh?  He treats questions as prompts for prepared talking points, not answers, no matter how relevant they may or may not be.  The best one can hope for is that he will repeat a word or phrase from the question in his otherwise non-sequitur "answer."  (Q: "Mr President, do you feel apples?"  A:  "I'll tell you what, I sure do feel oranges.")   Tonight, in a press conference littered with gems, my personal favorite was when Bush was asked what has been his biggest mistake (post-trading Sammy Sosa, post-911).  Totally flustered, he said he couldn't think of an answer.  ("The spotlight," he claimed.  "The pressure.")    Who is this guy?  I've given better answers to tougher questions interviewing to work in a grocery story.  And I  didn't   get the job.  How, again,  urlLink did   urlLink he   urlLink get   urlLink his ?
