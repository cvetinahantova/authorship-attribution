so, if you keep up with the right margin of this page, you'll notice the top book got taken off my reading list and a new one just added...  took advantage of my self-imposed friday night at home to finish the book i've been reading for the last week: brennan manning's  the ragamuffin gospel ... seems appropriate to put a brief summary.  from the start, the book is all about "this is a book for ragamuffins... not for people who feel they have their whole life together and figured out"... throughout the main theme is: God's love for everyone is indescribably HUGE... and if you think you have a clear conception of it, that's when you realize just how faulty your measurement of it is... mostly it re-emphasized to me God's love is not a factor of my feelings (thank goodness) or of how good or bad or whatever i am... God's love is huger than huge and constant and always there, even in the void of where you feel nothing.    a paragraph i really liked "it is the ragamuffin who rightly comprehends... she often experiences the "null" -- the felt absence of God.... she lives in the void but knows that the void is completely saturated with love"  that just hit me square on where i'm at right now, and it was good to be reminded that sometimes the "voids" are just as much a valid part of life as the highs and lows.  anyhow, end of book review. =)  i'm glad i read it -- kinda interesting that i randomly started it, read a chapter a day, and get to the conclusion on a day i really really needed to hear it.  next book on the list?   candide ... political satire... colleen and scott both read it on the road trip a couple weeks ago and laughed the whole way through... if i find it even half as funny, it'll be great.  tomorrow jessica comes... we're going to the MET... i'm excited. =)  now really, night =)
