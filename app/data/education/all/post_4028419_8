How often do we tell ourselves "I love you"?  I mean, we're quick to tell a girl/guy that we love them, yet it feels awkward for us to tell ourselves the same.  Don't believe me?  Well, get out a mirror RIGHT NOW and say to the person in it, "I love you."....do it for real! --well, if you did it (and especially if you didn't), then you see my point.  But the thing is, why have we conditioned ourselves to give "love" so freely to everyone else but ourselves!? Isn't that the FIRST person (note: person, not being like God) to whom we should say "I love you"?  I know a lot of people, me included, who wonder why they don't have love in their lives; but the thing is, how will I ever know if someone is loving me right when I don't love me?  And this kind of thing shows.  People can tell when you don't love yourself.  Well, before you can really seek this "everlasting love," you must give that same love to yourself.      My approach is to love me COMPLETELY; this way, I will know what good, true love is supposed to feel like...also, when "he" comes along, I will love  him  the way that he deserves, also!  I'm not about that empty "I love you" phrase, and this life is too short to fill it with a bunch of nothingness!
