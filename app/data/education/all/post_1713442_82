urlLink Directory of Online Resources for Information Literacy (DORIL)  Although this site is a little dated in spots, this is an excellent place to look for good online resources relating to information literacy.  DORIL recently changed hands and Mark Dibble at the University of South Florida is now managing the directory.  It is organized into 12 sections:  - Assessment  - Bibliographies and Webographies  - Conferences  - Definitions  - Electronic Mailing Lists  - Information Literacy Plans  - The Information Literacy Process  - Organizations and Projects  - Papers and Presentations  - Programs in Higher Education  - Programs in K-12 Education  - Tutorials  I am sure if you visit the site you will find something interesting and worthwhile.
