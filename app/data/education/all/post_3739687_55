hello,  well i went to the hospital yesterday.  bangkok christian hospital right  acroos silom road, which is very close to my school and my apartment.   anyway... it was great.  no long wait and the doctor said just as much as  they always do.  i have an ear infection, that i've had since ko chang, so  he gave me penicillan and ear drops.  probably exactly what they would have  done in the states.  only hear it was very inexpensive, about $22.  not bad  for a hospital visit i think i should get sick while i'm here. jk.  other than that i don't have much to say.  school has been keeping me very  busy lately.  i actually feel guilty about writing this email because i'm  supposed to be grading papers, doing research, and completeing my lesson  plans.  ugh.  i have so much to catch up on i'm not sure where to start.   they sure do keep us busy around this place.  also, sister erlinda is  freaking out about everything today because the ministry of education is  coming to visit the school.  however, the kids are behaving even my least  favorite class was manageable today.  wow.  i wish they were like that  everyday.  gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?
