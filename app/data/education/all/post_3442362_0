For some reason, when I hear the word memorial I think of a casket.  So there's my advise.  Go with the pine.  It's cheap and I think it looks better than those cheap ass metal ones anyway.  I don't suppose you get that super seal warranty thing with the pine though.    I saw a show the other night with some guys who'd had body parts blow off while serving in Iraq.  So very sad.  And for what?  None of them seemed bitter in the least.  (although I don't suppose they would select guys with an axe to grind to be on their cute little program, now would they?)  At least their recoveries seemed very quick.  Fit and healthy going in...no arm and a fucked up foot coming out.  geez  We spend the last couple of nights in Shiner.  It was hot.  And there's not a lot else to say.  We celebrated Connie's 60th with fajitas and chocolate cake, which were both fantastic as usual.  Some cat that I didn't know existed had 6 super cute little kitties which were in a box in the corner at Kenneth's.  I guessed we pissed her off with all of our fondling of her babies and she ran off with them this am.    Super evil cat Baby has now taken over the tv room.  That is the most horrid creature that ever lived.  I think next time we're there I'll accidentally leave out some rat poison.  where do i buy rat poison?    Trevor washed the dishes.  (Yes, the above statement was significant enough to warrant a paragraph all of it's own.)  About paragraphs, I think i might need to freshen up on those.  One main idea or something...  We tried a new barbeque place on the way home--Old Smokehouse Express or something like that.  The bbq was pretty good, but the floor was very greasy.  It was really crowded though.  I'm not sure why that would make the floor greasy, but...
