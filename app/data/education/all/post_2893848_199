Break My Body   Holy shit, tix for  urlLink the Pixies reunion tour are selling for $625 on eBay , begging the question: could Gen X possibly surpass their parents in the extravagent lengths they will go to to satisfy their self-nostalgia?    I love the Pixies, I love Frank Black, I even throw on the occasional Breeders album when I am nostalgic for high school.  But I also love $625 and all the groceries, drugs, cds, books and electricity it can buy me.  And any room full of people who paid $625 to be there sounds like a room to be uncomfortable in, and, quite frankly, a room full of assholes.  Republican fund-raisers come to mind.  (Charity doesn't count.)
