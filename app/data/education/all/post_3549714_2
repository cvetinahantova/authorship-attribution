She looked in the mirror and the image it reflected really took her by surprise...somehow it reflected a beautiful girl with sparkling eyes reflecting all the dreams and passions of tomorrow,shadows of a beautiful past....hopes of future........ahhhh!!! life was wonderful...just looking at the reflection made her shiver with excitement... She was an ordinary and plain looking girl but a very strange feeling tranformed her into a princess........ luv is beautiful  now she wanted to sing ,songs of happiness..songs of passion....even the dull colored flowers in the pot nearby, looked more bright..just like her smile..a smile that suddenly could brighten someone's day,give way to light into the darkness...even she didnt know what actually made her feel more real.....what was it that gave her the realization of the existence of a beautiful soul within her....it was  HIS LOVE  that shone thru her eyes...reflected thru her smile....and danced around her making her feel like walking on water and touching the stars.. Some say luv is bliss........a blessing that is granted to those who are special..she was a special girl with a sensitive heart that could beat for the poor ,that could cry for those who were in pain...she deserved to love and be loved!! Just his thoughts brought contentment to her heart and smiles to her lips..she was in  LOVE!! He never looked into her eyes to say that they were deep enough for him to feel like getting drowned....nor he ever parised her looks ,he never said that he loved her..or wanted her badly enough..but some feelings are strange enough just like some strange people who some how enter into our lives unknowingly..just the thoughts of them make us beam and feel wanted.She was struck by the same romantic fantasy...he was no where but every where she looked...he never was there, but the feel of his presence in her life made her feel alive..love is strange.... rite!! she never saw him,never met him ,but still every night she slept with his memories shut down behind her eyes....spent the whole nite dreaming about him......HIM!!...........who was virtually living in the computer she owned...who was a virtual existence that was always alive in her chat window when ever she logged on...who was always all ears to listen to her...to feel her,to make her life as beautiful as ever...talk about the miracles of internet....it makes u alive when u r at the verge of loosing urself as an entity..makes u feel beautiful when u start feeling that u have lost the whole beauty of ur soul and ur mind...this is the place where ur mind lives and let u b what u want to b ..let u fall in lov with whom to want to fall for...life is beautiful here.Thanks to all the virtual souls!!!!
