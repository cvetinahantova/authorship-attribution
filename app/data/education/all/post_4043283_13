Countdown: 308 days      I still can't spell that boy's name. Hehe. But, anyway,  Keithan  is my little second cousin. He's probably my favorite, coz he's always so hyper and cute and affectionate towards me. ^^ I went to see him yesterday and the first thing he did when he saw me was attach himself to my leg. Then he gave me a bite-size Snickers. ^^ I love lil kids. Hehe.      Later, when my sister was scaring him, he climbed onto my lap and hugged me and said, "I'm scared of the ghost. I'm scared. I'm gonna stay here." ^^ Then he gave me a hug and kiss before I left. I felt loved. ^^                  Horoscope for Gemini  01 Aug 2004        You probably aren't getting straight answers to your questions. Gambling should not be an option.
