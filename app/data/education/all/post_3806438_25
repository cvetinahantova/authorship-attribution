The first Spider-Man movie was pretty corny and about what everyone was expecting from a movie of that genre.  The dialogue was lame, and the story was silly and overbearing, but the action was moderately cool and everyone went to see it.  Spider-Man 2, which I saw over the weekend, was actually very good.  The plot was engaging, the comedy was heartfelt, the action was good, the villain was cool.  All in all, this was a brilliant film.  I didn't believe I'd ever see myself say that, but I just can't help it.  It was a damn good movie.  There were corny moments. Mary Jane dating an astronaut, for God's sake.  And when did NASA start enlisting 23 year old astronauts?  Also Mary Jane running through the park in her wedding dress with a goofy smile.  On the whole, however, the movie was dope and I recommend it.
