I've recently been hanging out in the  Recently Updated  section of www.blogger.com looking for some sites, and to my surprise I found many. Fine, lots of them were boring... And most of the rest were in a different language...  Still, I have found myself around 5 sites which now reside in the Blogs section of my Favorites.  Hmm... I just noticed it's spelt Favorites rather than Favourites. I wonder if there's an Australian version of IE6...  Anyway, I'll keep an eye on them. Some I mater later decide are boring and shall once more return to the pit of Recently Updated blogs. The others may even find themselves placed on here to share with all you people reading this. Then again, the only people reading this are probably the people who's blogs are in my favourites list anyway.
