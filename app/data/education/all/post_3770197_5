Men are very much like us women when it comes to shopping.Â  In fact, they're much more picky than we are. Like us, they ask, "Does this make my butt look big?" Like us, they say, "Ugh! I can't decide!" Like us, they say, "I don't like how this is so small up here but so big down there" or vice versa.
