I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to write this blog, seeing as there are no words to describe last night. In answer to my mother's question "Was it good?" on the journey home last night, all I could say was "Ohhhhh wowwww... best gig EVER". Have you ever experienced a total connection, a total sense of belonging, like this is the place or time that you could stay in forever? That was last night. I knew the words to every single song except for one new one (from their new album coming out in July yaaaaaaay), and I moshed, skanked, ran around like a crazy person and then I moshed some more; the people were all there for the same thing, to see the same band, to sing the same songs; it was like going home. Bliss. I don't know if anything will ever live up to it... until I go and see them again, that is ;o)  Ceff x   This is a fair request, and I promise I will not judge any person only as a teenager. If you will constantly remind yourself that some of my generation judges people by their race, their belief, or the colour of their skin, and that this is no more right than saying all teenagers are drunken dope addicts or glue sniffers...
