urlLink Children and Grief. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest was written by Nancy McEntire.  It views methods that parents and educators can use to help kids deal with grief.  From the ERIC Digest:  The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (1998) cautions parents and teachers that, although most children grieve less over time, counseling might be considered if children exhibit several of these behaviors over an extended period:   * Depression so severe that a child shows little interest in daily activities   * Inability to sleep, eat normally, or be alone   * Regression in behavior to that of a less-mature child   * Imitation of the deceased person   * Repeatedly wishing to join the deceased   * Loss of interest in friends or play   * Refusal to attend school or a persistent and marked drop in school achievement
