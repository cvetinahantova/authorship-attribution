urlLink Andrew Sullivan  has a good take on that NYT/CBS poll that had Bush down to a 50 percent approval rating.  It seems that 47 percent of the sample were Democratic identifiers, much too high to be representative.  Contrast that with the most recent WaPo poll which has Bush's approval at 58 percent, essential unchanged from last month.
