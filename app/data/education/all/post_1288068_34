PHONE:  BRRRT! BRRRT!  BANK: Hello?  JENNY:  Hello, I've just qualified as a teacher and I have a job and everything, only I don't get paid 'til the end of September. So I was wondering if I had an overdraft facility to use until then?  BANK:  Ha! Are you freaking kidding me? Um, I mean no, there's nothing coming up on the screen here.  JENNY: I see. Well, I was wondering how I could get one?  BANK:  *doubtful pause* Well you see the problem is that there has been no, er,  income  of any kind this year.  JENNY:  No, that's because I've been training, you see. Postgraduate teacher training; I told you about it this time last year. When I was calling about my overdraft, remember?  BANK:  Right. Well do you have a copy of the contract for your new job? If you  really have one , you bloody layabout.  JENNY: Yes! Yes I do! I can fax it to you!  BANK:  Yes, that would help your cause. Can you also give me your contact number?  JENNY:  Yes it's ... 0207 - 73, no 779, no ... actually, can I get back to you on that one?  BANK: Er, yes alright. Goodbye.  Jesus   JENNY: Goodbye!  PHONE: Click brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  CONTRACT: *is hopelessly lost*
