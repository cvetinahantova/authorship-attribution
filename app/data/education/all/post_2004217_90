Arrrgggghhhhhhh!!  Have problems. Cannot write them here. One, because writing on the computer screen is probably unadvisable, but also because people read my blog. Bugger. I will have to sit here and twitch with irritation until it all goes away.   She said I've gotta be honest,  you're wasting your time if you're fishing round here.  And I said you must be mistaken,  I'm not fooling, this feeling is real.  She said you've gotta be crazy! What do you take me for?  Some kind of easy mark?  No, you've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion,  but I swear that you've got me all wrong.  All wrong, all wrong,  but you got me...   I'll be true, I'll be useful,  I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear,  and I'll belong to you, if you just let me through.   This is easy as lovers go,  so don't complicate it by hesitating, And this is wonderful as loving goes,  this is tailor-made,  what's the sense in waiting?   And I said I've gotta be honest,  I've been waiting for you all my life.  For so long I thought I was asylum bound,  but just seeing you makes me think twice.  And being with you here makes me sane,  I fear I'll go crazy if you leave my side.  You've got wits, you've got looks, you've got passion, but are you brave enough to leave with me tonight?  Tonight, tonight, you've got me...   I'll be true, I'll be useful,  I'll be cavalier, I'll be yours my dear.  and I'll belong to you,  if you'll just let me through.   This is easy as lovers go,  so don't complicate it by hesitating,  and this is wonderful as loving goes,  this is tailor-made,  what's the sense in waiting?   This is easy as lovers go,  so don't complicate it by hesitating, and this is wonderful as loving goes,  this is tailor-made, what's the sense in waiting?   Ceff x   So much for your "endearing sense of charm", it served you well, but now it's gone and you're wasted on me
