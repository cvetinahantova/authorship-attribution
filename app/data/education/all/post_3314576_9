Today we are in the computer lab and we are supposed to be doing anything we need to pertaining to writing.  I'm not yet comfortable enough to blog on the wp blog page, so I thought I'd start by blogging here.  (I can't believe blogging is a verb! lol)  Today has been a great day so far- even thought is started out with my stepping on one of Lucy's bones and having it go   into   the bottom of my foot.  It couldn't have been in the tougher heel part... noooo.... it went into the softer part between your toes and your heal.... the arch I think is what it's called.  This morning we worked in groups to think of symbolism of the writing process.  It was a hoot!  I just happened to have a bunch of pictures of Lucy and Sharon suggested we compare the writing process to grooming/washing a dog-- it was so much fun.  I am learning so much as I participate in this project.  I also think it's pretty cool that the writing project I'm participating in is part of the National Writing Project!  I just think that is so neat.  We have to submit two writing pieces to the e-anthology for the NWP.  I'm not too confident in my writing ability, so I think I'm going to do a poem.  That way I won't have to worry so much about grammatical errors and mechanics.  I can just put my ideas down.  I'd better get writing....
