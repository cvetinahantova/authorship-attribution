Work is going well at the moment, but all I seem to be doing is eating. I've felt hungry since last night, (I had a couple of bags of crisps after a roast dinner with all the trimmings and pudding!) and I've already eaten half of my lunch - not normally unusual, but since having my medication, I've not felt like the munchies.
