Today I feel the world is really quiet  There’s no more birds singing in the outside..  The rain makes the inside cold  My inside……   Today the world is still  When the rights go wrongs…  When things turn bad  My choice, my believe, my commitment   Need to undo everything…  My precious moments, my secrets, my feeling  Can’t tell when I’m gonna feel  That the world is no longer quiet……
