They're evacuating a 1/2 km  from me. We're next. In case the power goes out, this will be my last email.    You can hear the police car loud speakers telling everyone to "leave immediately - this is an evacuation order!".  Jesse got tired of hearing them as he sat in the car waiting for us to finishing packing, and hollered back "We ARE evacuating!"  Too bad a kid his age has to even undertsand what evacuation means.  Wish us luck. We may be offline for a week or two.  Don't worry, we're safe.  Bye guys....
