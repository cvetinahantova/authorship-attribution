In comments to this  urlLink earlier post  about the Internet Evangelism Coalition meeting in September,  urlLink DJ Chuang  wrote:  I'd like to see virtual sessions at the IEC, for those who can't be there physically, to join the dialogue virtually. This is supposed to be an INTERNET meeting after all, right? How about using blogging, chat room, IM, message board, webcam, streaming audio/video, any and all technologies during the meeting, so we can all participate? Can you make it happen? :)  DJ, that all makes sense to me -- especially for a conference about the Internet. But can I make it happen? I'm not sure. I will relay your comments to the conference organizers and will do what I can to bring the conference to the online masses.  I do plan to blog about the conference, but I won't be blogging live (I'll probably be soaking up info at the sessions, and will be tweaking my own presentation), and I won't be there for the entire thing. (I'm speaking the evening of the 14th, and then speaking the next day at a  urlLink Gospelcom  meeting.) I hope to find out if other bloggers at the meeting will be blogging live, and once I find out who's going to be blogging from the IEC, I'll post a list of them here.
