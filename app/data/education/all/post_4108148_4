I've been thinking about blogging it for a while, and after a good cheese calzone I decided this was the day to do it.             Anyways, Its sad to see the weekend dwindling away.  Yesterday, was an awesome time at the movies.  Ielle and I left the Dunkirk/Fredonia realm to venture to the regal to catch a few flicks.  We caught the Village and The Manchurian Candidate.  Both were really good in their own ways, and much better seen in a real Theater, rather than catching them at the local Ghettoplex.  Trying to stay off of my feet because of Tendonitis in my Achilles hasn't been too bad.  If anything, its been encouraging me to get back into my love of watching movies.        On the way back from the movies, we drove by Ralph Wilson Stadium where the Buffalo Bills play their homegames. It reminded me of how I've always wanted to catch a Bills game in person.  After arriving home, I decided to act on the desire and now I know where I will be on Halloween.  Yes, I will watching the Bills from 13 rows back from the field : )
