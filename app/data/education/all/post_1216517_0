Apparently i've got a sportswriting job at the  urlLink antelope valley press .  It should start within 2 weeks.  For now I'm reading  urlLink White Noise  by Don DeLillo.  It's always good to sooth the soul with a little postmodernism while you're unemployed.  i don't really know what i think about the world getting ready to be blown up.  it's cool i guess.  i've been playing bocce ball in my yard quite a bit, keeps my mind off nuclear attacks.  i like microwaves.
