Anime and Dinner   I don't remember what we watched at Anime Club, except that it wasn't very entertaining... Or maybe it was just me being pissed at the MFAT thing which I had walked out of just 15 minutes before. In any case, I wasn't paying much attention. At one point Richard asked me to help him with his laptop. He wanted to use his USB ethernet card but forgot how to load the modules, so I tried messing around with it a bit. I think I forgot one step, but the basic setup was done. Charles took me to HEB an hour before the club meeting finished so that I could get stuff to make dinner... I made shepherd's pie. It came out pretty well, except that I miscalculated the portions and made too little... Well, with what we had there was no way that I could have filled those two casserole dishes... In the end it was just enough though, because we also made garlic brushetta for appetizer, so they filled themselves up with bread beforehand. I also think that the mashed potatoes were too salty.
