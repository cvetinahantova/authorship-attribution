I went upstairs last night because I could hear that Addison and Jaelyn were playing upstairs an hour past bedtime.  I told them to give each other a hug and say goodnight before I took Addison back to his room.  They exchanged a heartfelt embrace, and just before I lifted Addison away, Jaelyn said: “Wait a minute, Daddy, I want to say a prayer.”  I paused, she folded her hands old-school style.   “Dear Jesus.  Please help me make good decisions with my toys and not bring them into bed.  And please help Addison stay in bed when I call him to come over.  Amen.” .
