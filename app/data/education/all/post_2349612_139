(1) my roommate make spaghetti sauce and then puts it in our ice trays and freezes it.  this means we don't have ice, but rather tomato paste cubes... i don't put ice in my drinks usually, so this isn't a complaint... but, does anyone else think that's a little weird?  (2) eric disappeared for about 20 minutes of analysis today -- asked him where he went when i was driving him to band today... his response, "oh, i just didn't feel the need to be there so i went for a walk."  i wish i didn't feel the need to stay around in class when i'm tired of it ... oh well  (3) sam said he's getting me a ton of bouncy balls for my birthday -- this makes me happy =)  (4) nothing due til next wednesday and just a presentation between now and then (on monday)... i like this change of pace... working on cleaning out my yahoo email account... i have a couple people who have written me over 100 emails in past 3 months... duuude  (5) watching tv while i work on emails...mystic pizza (old julia roberts movie that's supposed to be bad) is on on before they were stars on bravo... half way watching,... they were in a planetarium just now... yay stars =)  the end.
