o.k. so i can't figure out how to send a digital picture.  honestly, i haven't taken very many pictures. anyway i'm just not a picture taker.  wish i could for ya'll but my patience is up.  something about the size of the file i'm trying to send.  anyway...  guess i lugged my camera and usb connector to school today for nothing.  oh well,  i'm sure i'll figure it out eventually.  well today was another boring day at school.  i think they hired me so they would have a built in substitute teacher.  i spent all day covering for the thai teacher which basically meant i was a baby sitter since i can't teach thai.  the kids got a chance to catch up on homework in other subjects so they were happy.  this schools loads the kids down with work so any chance to get ahead is usually welcomed.  they are basically good kids a little  spoiled but only a few are real brats.  not much else to say really.  i'm tired.  i think it's from not doing anything all day long.  that's more exhausting than actually working i think.  well hope everyone is having a great summer.  jane
