As I am getting ready to sleep all I can think about is how football is taking over my life.  i am dreaming of seeing England lifting the cup on the 4th July.  i feel so happy to see that Germany and Italy are going home, I am working out who we will be playing in the semi's and also how fantastic it will be when we meet France in the final and reclaim the victory that was stolen from in our first match.  As this runs through my mind I also think I really must work out my proirities, oh well that will be on the to do list for tomorrow.
