OK...yes..now maybe I'm overdoing it...but this was of interest to me because of the religious aspect now.  I feel Josh Rendall and other "relgious believers" may find this interesting.  Apparently a deacon of a christian church has come forward with the idea of selling christian bobbleheads to promote athletics in religious activities.  Yes, he has started selling these bobbleheads to help the christian community participation in professional athletic events and to even start their own teams.  So far a hockey team and some other team has been formed from his doings.  He stated that he thought it was time that religion was made a bigger part of sports!  Thats my word...peace out!
