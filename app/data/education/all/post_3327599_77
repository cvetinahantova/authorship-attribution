I made a Quiz for you!  Take my Quiz!  and then  Check out the Scoreboard!   so i made this cuz i was bored. and then i forgot to save the link.. so i had to redo it to keep my mind off some other stuff..   ppl never cease to amaze me. someone is always doing something shitty to rile up somebody else.. it's like no one is happy unless they are pissing off at least one person. hell i've been there, yeah it was funny to piss off some of John's friends on AIM because they didn't know who i was, but when you fuck with them at a really personal level.. that's taking it too damn far. it doesn't make me feel better about myself to tell someone their bf or gf is cheating on them or using them or anything like that, i dont know anybody who gets some sick pleasure out of fucking with someones emotions.. you have to be a really sad person to get a kick out of that.
