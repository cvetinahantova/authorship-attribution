Is the 'me' and 'not me' real or just a perception? Well, the 'me' must be real, because without a real me to percieve, the perception of me wouldn't exist. I assume that a perception can't percieve itsself. As for the 'not me', I can't be sure of that. It is possible that the 'me' might percieve what isn't there and make me belive that there is a 'not me'. Regardless, I choose to treat the 'not me' as if it were real, because I have no way of verifying it's realness except by external observation of the 'me' which is logically impossible. (My perception of 'me' and 'not me' is intrinsically linked with 'me', which I can never escape.)
