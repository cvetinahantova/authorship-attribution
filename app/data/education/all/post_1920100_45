Today was an interesting day.    At art camp the kids had another wet n wild day. We got a whole bunch (the teacher's and assistants) water ballons and super soakers and we got all the kids wet. It was a lot of fun!! Tomorrow is the last day of art camp. I can't believe it! I was having so much fun! The students are great and the people working camp too.  We have a lot of volunteers that come each day and help. The volunteers have to do 20 hours to get their course credit for one of their art classes. I am going to miss the kids and doing art. After work we have to tear down all the classes. We might go all out to have dinner afterwards because one of the girls works at this good bbq place but I am not sure I am going yet. It depends on my friend because she is driving. Now I have like a month before work and school starts! YIKES!!! I will be going to school 3 nights a week for seven weeks and I am done with my credential! Time has flown by. I have so much to do to get ready for my class but I am excited. I am just an overplanner sometimes.....    Decision....Crisis.....    Since I am finishing this fall I will start my Master's program in Spring. The dilemma is I don't know where I am going yet. I can continue and stay at CSUF or I am thinking of going to Whittier College or Biola University. Both of those schools are prestigous and are private universtities and are closer to home, but the problem is that they are more expensive. My heart is gearing towards Biola because it is a Christian University. I think it will be great to be all around fellowship while at school. It's hard meeting people at school that are so into the world and have not much in common with what I believe. So I think I will have a better experience at Biola. I have been praying about this. I am just waiting to see where God wants me to be.
