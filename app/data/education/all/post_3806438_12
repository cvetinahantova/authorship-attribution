This is a matter of pure conjecture, but I would guess that Hilary Clinton is not routing for John Kerry this election season.  The reason is that she's probably eyeing and election bid of her own in 2008.     If John Kerry wins this year, then he'll obviously get the incumbent nomination in 2008.  Hilary wants to run in '08, I'm betting. If she loses her senate seat, which is definitely a possibility if Giuliani decides to run against her, then she'll be irrelevant by 2012, or at least less relevant than she'd like unless she moves somewhere else and becomes a senator.     Anyway, I'm just thinking out loud, but isn't that the point of this blog to begin with?
