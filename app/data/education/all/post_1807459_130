Somehow I'm still not where I should be, which is in bed asleep.  Well I did manage to get through work without any serious problems from my lack of sleep.  This is good b/c I sure as hell don't want to work Sunday morning.  I hate working Sunday mornings.  Last time my experiance sucked really hard, this probably being due to the fact that I had no sleep what so ever.  Anyway I still don't have the energy to talk about Saipan but maybe tomorrow.  I did housever have enough to do another quiz.    urlLink     urlLink How evil are  you ?   I love Scott but he is an idiot.  My visa expires tomorrow so I have to go to immigration with him.  He's already canceled on me twice.  If I get in some sort of trouble I'm not  going to be happy.  Things should be cool.  It just really annoys me that he is busy to the point that he is constantly forgetting shit and having to cancel.  Anyway I'm off to bed.
