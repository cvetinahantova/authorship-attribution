Two years ago, I worked at the Ren fest in Shakopee, MN, and let me tell ya, that was an eye-opening job. The people that I worked with there were completely different from the people that I tended to run into in a regular day. It was fun in a way, just to see how "the rest of the world" related to each other and how I fit into that. It was hard sometimes, too, because I know that I am not like them in many ways, primarily because I know that there is a reason for my existence and that it is not for me to enjoy life as much as possible. I don't think I ever really witnessed to anyone there, not even by the way that I behaved, which is something I'm not proud of.  I live in a pretty cloistered environment most of the time here. I mean, I work in a Christian environment. I don't go out in the evenings or the weekends to any type of events except for church. Any other place I go to, Walmart or the grocery store or the coffee shop, I don't really talk or interact with people much. And even if I did, this is the "Bible belt." People around here are pretty well-behaved. Not all, but the majority, probably.  Lately, I've started reading some of the forums at Keenspot. My goodness! If you're ever looking for a secular culture, you'll find it there. Some spots are pretty tame and others are really crude. I was sitting there reading earlier on my lunch break, just amazed at the things that come off of these people's fingers! But I don't want to go off on that. I just keep thinking about how I do and don't fit into the secular world. I'm borrowing a Rich Mullins CD from Debi and listening to him makes me think about how he finished what he was asked by God to do and God took him home. How wonderful would it be to go home?! But I have yet to do the things that God has asked me to do and I'm sure that it has a lot to do with the secular world by which I am surrounded. And one of the many questions I keep asking myself is how will I communicate with that culture?
