Hi! I'm here in school just searching the web and I went to this one site that is pretty cool. Click  urlLink here  to see it. It's just a phobia list but its pretty cool. LOL, I love it... Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words. That is just cruel to people that actually suffer from Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia because they could never pronounce what they have. LMAO, I cant even pronounce what they have =/. It's all right though. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with this post =/, I didn't mean to! I just think that its a little funny on how that phobia name worked out.
