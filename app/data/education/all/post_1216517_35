I went to the  urlLink Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve  the other day.  It was really cool.  i think I'd like to do a bit more hiking.  There are a few cool places aroud the AV.   urlLink Saddleback Butte ,  urlLink Vazquez Rocks ,  urlLink Devil's Punchbowl .   I'm gonna check them out in the near future.
