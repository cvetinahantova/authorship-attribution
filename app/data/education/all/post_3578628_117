I understand what you're saying about differences.  It makes sense until a bunch piles on and before you know it, you have your friend worrying about you.  So do me something if possible...the first post I made were arguments for you.  It's what I thought your problems with me were.  Could you tell me if I am off or on and add any I missed?  I got your emails.  I will continue in the direction I was going soon.
