Well today was just the same old same old. My father called this morning wanting his mail.  I really wish he wouldn't do that.  He never calls to see how I'm doing, just to get stuff or to yell and scream about crap my brothers did 20 years ago. Like I don't have enough stress in my life.I think I'm gonna have all his mail forwarded to my stepsister in Vegas.  My stepmonster worships the ground she and her illigitimate mullato daughter walk on.  I love how any guy I bring home isn't good enough, but they LOVE my stepsister's black ex-con on-again off-again shack up.  It doesn't bother me that he's black, it bothers me that he's been in prison, and more than once for that matter. Other than that I spent the day shopping for bunny supplies, getting ready for my little one!! I am SO EXCITED!!!! He's not comming home for a couple of weeks yet, but I got him a nice roomy cage (they were on sale!) and some toys and a harness and leash! I'm gonna try to train it to take walks, like a farret!  I know it's possible!  Bunnies are smart! Not to mention CUTE!!! OH he is so adorable.  I think I'll go by and visit him tomorrow when I get out of class. Speaking of which...YEAH!! I am going back to school!!! NO MORE BOREDOM!!!! My friend Rob wants to come over and play Magic on Wed, and I might, pending on when I get out of class.  He's going through withdral not playing with us on Friday, he was in Vegas for his Bachelor Party.  (I went a few weeks ago with his fiancee).  Well I am still working away, I need to send drafts of lesson plans to my master teacher three days ago.  I have ideas, several of them in fact and I've gotten some good stuff off the net, but it's all a matter of putting it out on paper and changing things around.  I'm nervous!!
