Three expressions that may or may not be Scottish  Depending on who you ask. I'm sure many Scots would assert that none of the following are Scottish at all, merely the product of my addled mind.   Just now  Are you serving food just now? When did it happen? Just now!  This means 'right now' or 'this instant!' It looks kind of stupid written down, I guess I should try to phase it out. Or  phrase  it out. Ha! Oh dear.   Will we ..?  Will we go for coffee? Will we go to the pub just now and get food later?  I only found out that this was unusual last week ... It isn't a request for precognitive ability; rather an uncouth way of saying 'shall we?' It is tr√®s gauche and I apologise to all in retrospect. Will we move on?   Where do you stay?  Yes, I mean live. Screw you sideways.  Well that's everything I can think of at the moment. For the record, Scottish viewers, I was just considering expressions that I use every day, hence the exclusion of 'aye' and 'dinnae' and 'shitebag'.   That is a good one, though.
