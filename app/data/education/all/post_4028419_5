3-2-1, 1-2-3 what the HECK is bothering me?!!  Whew! had to get that outta my system.  I am just frustrated with my life and most of the people in it.  I do not understand why people just use their word so loosely-knowing they have no intentions of keeping it.  And what's with these people that ONLY decide you're worth something once you stop giving them the time of day.           *KB is starting to call me and saying how he wants things to be the way they  were....UUUGGHH! I had TOLD him a long time ago, when he first started actin' up, that once a person takes me for granted and keeps letting me down and never making me feel like I have at least SOME importance in his life, then my heart slowly, but SURELY moves away from him.  It's like getting cut too many times in the same place; you start to get used to the pain and therefore your feelings become numb.  And the only reason he's started to try to come around and do right is because he senses that I had pulled away from him.  That's BEEN over! The thing about me, I'll love someone completely, but if he abuses that, doesn't return it, or whatEVER, then I close that door!          Then it seems like the guys who ACT like they're SOOOO interested are so darn caught up in trying to be a player that they neglect the fact that I'm a good person...until I've LOST interest!          Oh, and let's not forget the married ones!  What the heck is wrong with you?  If I'm supposed to be the one you think you would just loooooove to be with, u shoulda took a bit more time BEFORE getting married to think about that possibility--heck, don't  I  deserve someone of my own?!  Maybe I don't...          My GOD! I deserve so much more in my life and I know it.  I know I'm not perfect, but I have so much in me that I know is good and I deserve a good person that WANTS to be in my life....not one who feels OBLIGATED to be or feels THREATENED that I might not be "pining away" for him anymore.  It has me so sad because I feel VERY alone right now.  Even the few friends I do have are ignoring me...okay, I might just be making that up; U know I can make a mountain out of a mole hill--but it FEELS that way!!!          I just feel so sad right now; very let-down at every, and I mean EVERY turn.  I think the problem is that I put my trust in Man(not as a substitute for God)...and we know, Man will disappoint you every time.  Knowing this...how do you stop hurting?  Sometimes the pain is unbearable and everyone around me thinks I'm okay 'cause I manage to keep a smile on my face--If they only knew...          I seriously feel like giving up--not on LIFE! (lol)--but on being happy, at least not in the "true love" way.  I just don't think it's in the cards for me.  It seems like I get my hopes up for no reason bc the person only wants "something else".   I guess there are people in this life who are meant to just be used for sex, leaned upon for emotions, and disregarded for everything else...am I one of 'em?          *Disclaimer:  This sounds really depressing, but it's how I feel at the moment!  Don't worry, I'm not about to jump off a cliff!--lol
