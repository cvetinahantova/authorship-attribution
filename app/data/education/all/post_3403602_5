OMG! I had a blast today. When I thought that this Spring Break would be  BORING  it became the best just for one day. Me, Lucy, Lucy's lil bro, and Celi went to the movies. It was soo fun. We just laugh and laugh. We threw spitballs at each other. We went to see "Takeing Lives". We were gonna see the "Alamo" but eh! We didnt want to after all. Oh man my friend Celi, a great grrrl to be friends with and to talk to cuz she is funny, she was soo dum. There was a part when the actress was in some room. The actress was leaning against the wall. And Celi goes "Oh man the would be trippy if the doors open." I go "What?! Doors do open" She goes "Oh shit I mean the walls." Funny ass shit....I kept on buggin her about it. Yeah it was fun. And thanx to Lucy for telling me this. If it wasnt for her I would have hung myself because of this  BORING  Spring Break. Yeah some guy named Louie was supossed to go but he didnt go after all. Soo I wanted to meet him. Oh well...Maybe next time. Ugh...okay that was today sooo Yeah! Bye!!XoxO
