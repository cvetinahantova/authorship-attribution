What matters most Is not when you knew you love with me But how I feel I feel compassion, terderness and careness  What matters most Is not what you said to make me love you But what you do You treat me as I’m your own heart  What matters most Is not all the sweet words in the world you say to me  For, I know You’ll be here  To be my eyes when I’m blind  As my ear when I’m deaf  Being my legs when I’m stumble  That’s….what matters most
