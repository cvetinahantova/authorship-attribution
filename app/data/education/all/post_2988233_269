Yep, I am cool mom again.  I'm babysitting Savannah today, and they are currently painting, finger painting, and brush painting, on my coffee table, without and newspaper laid out, or anything.  I haven't paniced and screamed when they walk in with paint all over their clothes, I didn't lose it when they showed me the pain they spilled on Jamie's blanket.                  I have smiled and gushed over every masterpeice they have brought to me, held behind their back, saying "close your eyes"  and then yelling "priiiiizzzzzzzze" while handing this , dripping wet, used to be paper, to me.    I won't fuss over the fact there is paint all over my wood floors, today, it just isn't worth it.    The looks on their faces is too priceless to crush.
