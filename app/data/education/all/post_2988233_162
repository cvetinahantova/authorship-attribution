Scrufty made it thru the night.  So did the rest of us.    I don't know how many times I woke up to check and see if he was still breathing.  You would have thought I had given him birth or something!  Jamie is doing better now.  He kept asking me all evening, "is Scrufty going to die".  I felt so sorry for him.  He just moped around the house all night.  He wouldn't touch scrufty at all.  Poor kid.  He thought he killed the family pet.  That is enough to send a kid to therapy for years.    But he will be ok once he gets to go outside and play with scrufty.  The boys have sworn off baseball now.  You know, Noah got beaned in the head twice (mild concussion both times) once with the bat, once with a foul ball, and it didn't amke them want to stop playing baseball inthe yard, but they hit the dog, and they quit.  Go figure.
