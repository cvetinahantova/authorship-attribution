Prepare to grillify as I quarter-centurify.  Wednesday night, 7:30, my house (email for the address if you need it).  I'm not sure who is in town and I'm a really lazy inviter, so bring whoever in addition to any meat, beer, processed non-meat, non-processed non-meat, etc, that tickles your fancy.  Needless to say, if you are reading this blog and I don't know you, consider yourself left out.  I don't want any cokehead child molesters showing up unless I know them.
