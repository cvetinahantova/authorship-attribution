leigh and i worked at starbucks awhile today, at the outside patio tables -- such beautiful weather.... tomorrow's high 88!!!  how nuts is that???  i figured out part of an analysis problem that sam's been struggling with, and sam is like analysis genie -- he knows like everything there is to know plus some and is good friends with the prof. who wrote the book (from his undergrad university) -- that was a much needed mathematical confidence booster -- we'll see how long it lasts, but right now i'm still on cloud 9 about that for a bit =)  i got scott to do a seed impression -- he was a flower the other day and it cracked me up... he's refused to repeat that, but him curling up in a ball on the floor and saying "the seed hides under the ground, and then it stretches up, peeks its head up, sees the sun and hides again (acting things out as he says them)... look, see how little i can be?!?!" all in falsetto was hilarious... i was laughing so freakin hard when i left campus earlier  i've made calls and filled in my schedule for next month... i have places to stay may 12-25th... and there's one more person i'd like to talk to and see if their schedule matches up for me to stop by them too for a day, but who knows -- yay for fun upcoming travels!  oh! and on the housing front, colleen, leigh, and i all agreed we liked the townhouse apartment (the one i liked better on friday), rather than house, but that we want to research our chances of getting a townhouse on our own rather than subletting from this other guy before we tell him a definite yes.  we shall see, but at least we're all on the same page =P  dude, it's 9:45pm and i've yet to eat dinner... maybe i should look into that... later dudes! =)
