Today sucked...oh what, doesn't everyday suck? um, yeah they all do. I went to school from 10-5:15. I should have left school at 3:30 when I turned my work in but I had to stay to do this english/grammer program on the computer. I didn't even finish it but I told the teacher that I had to go and she was okay with that. When I got home my mom was cooking bbq chicken, yum! We ate dinner around 7 then I hung out with my brother and kevin( urlLink http://www.xanga.com/theshredder22 ). (yes alyssa, he was at my house today ) Then at about 8.p.m. Kevin got picked up and we were talking with his cousin while we were waiting for his uncle and my mom to stop talking. It's crazy, kevin and his cousin look like they could pass for twins, even though they are 3 months apart. Anyways enough about my brothers friends. Like the new layout? It is something different and guess what?! I made it myself. yay*claps* haha, I just took the picture of my desk and pencil. jeeze i love digital cameras. I'm such a retard. lol This weekend I'm not sure what I'm doing yet but I really want to see samantha because I haven't seen her since last year? I'm such a bad friend...I can never keep in touch with nayone. I'm actually surprised I still keep in touch with the sdcyb girls. maybe it's because i love them so much.. yeah so there is nothing relly interesting in my life to tell about so I'm going to bed now...at the usual time 2 o'clock am zzZZzZZZzz nighty night
