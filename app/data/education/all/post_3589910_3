I was reading " healing with the faeries ". I actually just pick it up and read whatever come. Well, I was reading on manifestation, nothing new to me, only I have hard times teaching mom that. It has worked for me so far. Its all about positive thinking.  Imagine it already happened what you want to happen, imagine it with every detail. And then imagine it every time you can. Dream about it, feel it as if was real, and with perseverance, anything is possible. It's great. We all have that cosmic power within us. We just have to know how to reach it. And the first step is throughout healing, healing of your heart and soul, your whole body and spirit. Not with pills or any like it. But spirituality. Meditation, imagining pure white light entering you and dark one going out and disappearing.   Imagine angels healing you.... Its a great sensation. There are lots of books on it. And also websites with free information. I hope that one day I could teach everything I'm learning. With the help of God. Maybe not in multitudes like many, I don't like multitudes. But with each individual, little by little.
