A couple of new spam filters for personal use:    urlLink  Death2Spam Web Server  : "Death2Spam is a third-generation Internet email filtering service"  --The basic version is free for personal use while a premium version is available for a "minimal annual subscription".  On their website I didn't find how much that is.   urlLink  Spam Shredder  : "Powered by an intelligent learning engine that analyzes users' decisions to keep or delete suspected spam messages, Webroot Spam Shredder learns to more effectively cull spam from desired messages as time goes on."  --This one costs $19.95 right now (usually $29.95).
