Dedicated to: CL, JC, AIAR, AMV, MB, PD, AS, TM, RS, DL and CA   This world is not for me as I am not for it I do not play the conformist games nor do I give a shit. What I am is me a pain for others to see mutilated...desecrated...humiliated, and a pain to be free! But I must go on I cannot die I must show others the way and that they must try. We must be one through individuality so to live this life and be who you have to be.
