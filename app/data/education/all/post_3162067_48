It feels like I have just had the longest sleep in the world (oooh, just noticed a load of new features have been added to my blog, must play with them later!) I woke up finally (after having many dreams that I was heavily pregnant) at 12.30pm: well over a 12 hour sleep and by god I feel refreshed. Very frustrated that I can't find 'Crank it up' as a ringtone download. Grrrrr. Yesterday was the most wonderful of lazy days where me and Si did absolutely nothing. Today will be pretty much the same except that I will reply to some emails and tidy the flat, which has gone back to its bombsite look again. Friday was my last proper day teaching (although this week I still have to go to work to do activities week). I received lots of wonderful pressies from my tutor group and a few other students and it feels like I have spent the entire day crying. They made me feel so special, bless them. I'll miss my tutor group so much.
