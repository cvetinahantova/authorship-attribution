urlLink The Streets - A grand don't come for free .  An amazingly ambitious and inventive record that tells a number of different stories.  Mike Skinner records the experiences of Suburban youth in way that brings laughs and tears.   urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  - I love  urlLink Charlie Kaufman  movies and this was his best.  Where  urlLink Spike Jonze  took him off into wiered wacky and warped territory very well  urlLink  Michel Gondry  uses Kaufman's quirkiness to tell a beautiful love story.   urlLink Mystic River  - Not sure enjoy is the best world.  I watched this with Helen yesterday and became immersed in it.  An epic of friendship, betrayal and tragedy that completely draws you in with its twists and turns.  It felt a lot like an old western which isn't surprising given its director.   urlLink Chatiryworld  - A very well designed blog by Helen's cousin Katherine.  I really like the way her blog reads, I guess that means she has a good writing style.  And she makes me laugh and think.   urlLink Four Tet - As serious as you like  (video) - Makes the link between electronica and  urlLink Morris Dancing !
