Nothing is going on.  I have no important news to report, other than the glaring fact that I have not yet seen Spider-Man 2 yet, because my best friend wants me to wait two more weeks until his birthday.  WHY CAN'T WE JUST GO SEE ANCHORMAN INSTEAD SO I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT!?!?!?!  I have a huge interview coming up next Wednesday for a third grade position at a school that I really want to work in.  It's a two hour interview, which means that I will have 120 minutes worth of opportunities to ruin my job prospects there.  I know that I put up this mantra about not having expectations because they ruin the present moment, but if I could do really well at this interview and have the job offered to me, I'd be very happy.    Summer Camp has officially started this past Tuesday, and it was a blast.  I am in a new group this summer and I'm literally in heaven.  I used to work with an inclusion camp (kids with special needs), and while that was a lot of fun (including the fact that I was working with my fiance), I felt it was time to move on to something with less stress (you wouldn't believe how much worrying I used to do while on the job).  Now, I'm working at a 6th-8th grade Fun Camp, which only goes on field trips.  The staff is excellent this summer, and the kids are all very good.  I think that's everything that's been going on for the last couple of weeks.  Oh, and my Xbox and I are the best of friends right now.
