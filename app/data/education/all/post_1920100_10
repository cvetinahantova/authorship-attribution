[ Wed Jan 07, 11:11:57 AM | Wendy Larios | edit ] Well for the hundred time....I was not able to the last blog...this really irritates me. I guess it was good afterall because it was a lot of venting. I guess I just needed to get it out and no one had to read it. But I don't know whenever this happens I always get discouraged to write.  Wow I haven't wrote in a long time...like since November of last year....ha ha...seems like a long time but it's only been two months. This last year has been amazing and I thank God for that. I have been very blessed and had many opportunities to learn. I pray that this year I can grow closer to God and that I can be used as a tool in whichever way for His glory. Although I still believe that there is nothing we can do that will get us to heaven the only way is through Jesus Christ...we just hope we can live in the light and that we become better servants.
