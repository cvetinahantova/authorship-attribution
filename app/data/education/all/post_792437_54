Lunch today..    Â  I had the honor of being invited to a lunch today with a speaker at my university that the college of science and engineering had sponsored. AT the lunch, there was another grad student, and an undergraduate who had been chosen to eat with him. Also there was the chair of the bio dept, the Dean of the college of science and engineering, and a few other professors. It was weird to be asked to go to this lunch, knowing that I was told someone had recommended me to go to it...I wonder who? A professor for sure...but wonder which one...  The lunch was okay. They served nasty ugly looking bloody steak. I looked at it, and lost my apetite, and never touched it! I just ate the blob of mashed potatoes by it, while listening to the speaker talk while he eats. Then I left early as I had a class...but later I found out they served cheese cake and I missed out!!! :( Greeeeaaaat!!!!!   Mmmm...I am studying for a test on friday; another biochemistry test. I have a firm grade in the class to not have to take the test, since our lowest test score is dropped. i could have this one dropped, but I'm studying anyways, just to see what i'd get...weird I figure, but heck it'll make my studying for the final a whole lot easier! Okay back to work...
