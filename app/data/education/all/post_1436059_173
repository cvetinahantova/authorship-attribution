This post is probably said out of immediate irrationality, so please do not take it seriously if it offends you terribly.  So, they killed that dude...Paul Johnson (sp?)...  It makes me sad, it really does, I mean, anyone who isn't sad about someone dying is weird...but...  How is his killing any different than all the people Americans are killing in the Middle East? Sure, we're over there to kill terrorists, but how many innocent Iraqis have been killed? THat's a tally number I haven't heard in a while. What other difference is there besides the fact that we just aren't killing terrorists one by one and putting their killings on the internet? Besides that, how are our killings any different than theirs?   I watched Joan of Arc today. After the battle for Orleans, she asks her captain (well, God), "Are those that died for England any less noble than those that fought for France?" Now, are those innocent (not necessarily terrorists) Iraqis dying any less human (not noble, per ce) than Americans dying? It is a war. Earlier in the scene between Joan and her captain the captain said that, "Even a holy war is still a war."   In a post I made today I said that after 9/11 I had begun thinking that maybe, just maybe, the world really  is  going down the toilet.  Well, kids...  The toilet has  flushed  and been  drained , taking your favorite  goldfish  George  along for the ride , getting  stuck  and  flooding the bathroom .   "Of all the things I've believed in, I just wanna get it over with. Tears form behind my eyes, But I do not cry. Counting the days that pass me by. And I've been searching deep down in my soul, Words that I'm hearing are starting to get old. Feels like I'm starting all over again, The last three years were just pretend."   Now I'm just plain tired.
