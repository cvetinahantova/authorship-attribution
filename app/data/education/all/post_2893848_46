Has anyone else seen  urlLink this contest  advertised in Vanity Fair?  I saw it in the issue that has David Beckham on the cover and a mustachioed Tom DeLay in its inner pages.  For those too lazy to link through, it's for $15,000 and a trip to an Italian writers' colony (not to be confused with an Italian-writers' colony), the deadline is July 31, and you have to explain the character of the American people (such as it is) to the rest of the world in 1,500 words.  Submissions are via email.    Montblanc is sponsoring it, perhaps as some sort of feint at improving Franco-American relations in the wake of the Freedom-Fries spasm.  Judging, alas, is blind, so the staffers at Vanity Fair can't be impressed by our Workshop credentials, only by the meaning, sense, and clarity of our sentences (and perhaps not even then).
