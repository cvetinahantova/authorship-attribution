Sparky is no longer with us.    That sounded so gloomy didn't it.  We set him free.  Back into the wild where he belongs.    Tommy came home from work and saw how small he was and told the boys he probably needed his mom, to put him back where they found him.  So, we don't have a turtle anymore.    Jamie cried.  He wanted a pet.     Have you ever seen Rugrats, the cartoon?  Well, Jamie is my Chuckie.  He is afraid of anyting and everything.  Literally.  You can tell him something, jokingly, and he goes all to peices.  He is very fragile about most things.  For him, a turtle was the perfect pet.  No fast movements, no loud noises, and it was more scared than he was!    Now the quest continues for Jamie a pet.  Tommy won't have hamsters or gerbils or any other rodent related animal, so that rules a lot of small pets out.  I'm thinking fish.  If we can keep the cat away from the tank.  Hmmmm, something to think about.
