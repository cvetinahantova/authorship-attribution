Postcards because I'm on a Mac by scott  For some reason, and the computer dude here verifies, i cannot post links due to the fact that i'm on a Mac. So all of my posts these next two weeks, in pete's stead, will be without links. Unless the "Blogger Help" really comes through. If some site grabs me and i feel it's worth the Impeccable reader's time, i will paste the link at the bottom of the post.   That said, now i want to point out that the man every writer loves to hate, dave eggers, will be appearing in chicago next weekend for the annual printer's row book fair. my own problem with eggers is that everything is a joke to him, often a joke he could expand into a clever literary device, but you might have another gripe with him. Anyone who can inspire as much enmity as eggers does is worth the price of admission. It's the same reason why i went and paid good money for "Soul Plane" (it was horrible beyond belief). I'm finding there's intrinsic value in our culture for something, some "art," that's quite bad. Its badness transcends.   An example: just last week i was at a hipster party, and these hipsters were talking about eggers and mcsweeneys. Their wrath was extensive, and some even pointed out their gripes with acumen (my fav was this hipster pointed out that he didn't like eggers or mcswys because they have brought a 'hip' element to literature, one with their marketing and graphic design skills, and hipness apparently had no place for this hipster in his canon), however these impasses did not prevent the hipsters from handing their money over for mcsweeneys subscriptions. The mag has value, and its value is in its badness. I'm saying "badness" because of its subjective touch, know that i'm really clueless to how people ascribe value to anything anymore.   link:  http://www.chicagotribune.com/extras/printersrow/program.htm
