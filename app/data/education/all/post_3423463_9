journeys consume our flesh rapidly we sit on the table drinking the wine of oblivion and creatures rip our eyes and flesh of our buttocks  with red eyes and green teeth they come in hordes and jump on our faces  we don't notice their screaming as we sip the wastes without recycling anything of our souls mouldering corrupting dying in the sand  we lie there now watching the waves wash the shore and transmit their strength to the sand  missing the power of the water we yearn for the homely starts and wish we could return to that place we left behind in the previous  maybe if we weren't oblivious maybe if we saw what we do and thought about the creatures jumping around stormily and wreaking havoc with mind and body always craving more and more of our lives and antiquities  hailing from nowhere we came and now inhabit the waste and the lush of the earth which supports us and gives us a place to stand while we wade through the drama of our lives  demons destroying us come from deep within or maybe not so deep perhaps they come from somewhere more topical perhaps the addition of body  and yet it seems that these demons spring not from flesh but from somewhere further somewhere more fundamental than dust more basic than element  and yet where is that and why and did i make my own so long ago and why did i shortsightedly allow room for so many demons did i not recognize them as such or did i welcome them subversively and in rebellion trying to sabotage myself  but sabotage is a demon where did he come from where did i make choices before i knew right from wrong  and why why oh why did i ever choose not right?
