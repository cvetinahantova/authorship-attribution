Thought I would feel more excited about finally reaching this week's deadlines. Hm.  The lecture this afternoon was tortuously slow and badly managed. I sat at the back with the usual suspects eating sugar-free Polos and drawing stick animals. Sally waxed lyrical about Andy's virility and Rob had a guffawing fit somewhere in the middle. I learned absolutely nothing about Career Entry and Development. I don't even feel bad.  Had a few jars in a pub somewhere in Kent for reasons that I still don't fully understand. Also wrote an introduction and essay plan for Jon while feeling slightly spinny; is terrible but I suspect he will use it anyway.  Feel pretty rotten now. Not at my most fabulous or verbose. Despite earlier protestations, I have no intention of going to college tomorrow. I need to go into town and buy some printing ink in exciting 'my turn Miss!' colours. Kids are so easily amused  -  a tube of pearlescent acrylic reduced my Year 7 group to blithering fools a couple of months ago.*  Barbara came up to me yesterday and whispered 'only four weeks to go, Jenny.' We are buying Barbara organic gin.  I am tired. See you tomorrow you lucky lucky people. x  * Sadly they remained blithering fools for the duration of the term. They should put that on the label really.
