Well, I wanted to take the CPA Exam, as well as the Real Estate Agent Exam; but I don't meet the requirements right now. In Illinois, you have to have at least 150 credits to take the Exam, and an accounting concentration or equivalent. However, I went to an impractical institution, which I regret nor in the least bit; but would have handier if it hadn't been.

Anyway, I am applying for a M.S. in Accounting. It's been five, six years since I last had to fill out application forms, and look for FinAid. And this year, I get to do it twice! That's ridiculous.

On the other hand, I am feeling a lot better now that I have something to focus on, and look forward to. The QLC just got a bit better. However, as I remember my student loans, rent and bills, it all becomes a bit grim again. 

When will it end... .
