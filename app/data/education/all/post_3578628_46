Alright, so it didn't work out, but that doesn't mean you can't get me into a position where I have to wait and postpone it.  That's right.  I have every intention of seeing Dodgeball friday when I get back from camp.  I also am thinking I will see two movies too.  So, think about it and then I'll talk to you about it when I get back.
