School ended June 4, quite a while ago.  Now I'm a freshman, woo!  I'm going to miss my favorite teachers though...there are five of them.  : Mr. Joe Southerton : Mrs. Lynch : Mr. James Southerton : Mr. Fee : Mr. Sanders :  I could have alphabetized them...but anyway...  I ran two miles today...in the rain.  But yesterday at Brooke's, Katie, Beth, Josh, Adam, Brooke, and I played volleyball in the rain...we were all soaked...and then we went to Brooke's gram's to swim in her pool...in the rain.  It was pretty fun...even in the rain.  But it was kinda cold for me...76F.  I like 84F...you can tell I prefer Florida and the Bahamas to Pennsylvania!  The National American Miss Pageant is steadily approacthing...July 25-26!  I'll be competing in two optional contests, actress and spokesmodel.  And, I have to introduce myself on stage...I don't know what to say.  I have to say my name, hometown, and ambition.  "Good morning!  I'm Elizabeth Gordon, I'm from Mifflinburg, and my ambition is to become a successful doctor and make a difference in the lives of the people around me." Like I'll remember all of that when I'm on stage *rolls eyes*.  I still have yet to buy my formal gown and business suit.  I'd better hurry!  Good luck to all contestants!  Maybe I'll cook dinner tonight...I mean my younger sister Sarah and I cleaned the house today.  And the fish tank.  Well, I cleaned it.  It was fun.  We have the two side-by-side sinks in our kitchen.  I cleaned the tank in one, and filled the other with water and put in the fish.  Then, Sarah and I put the fish in our bathtub...it was really fun.  Except Sally tried to get at it.  And Sally hates baths, but loves to swim.  Weird dog.  Anyway, I could always make fetticinne al fredo...I can't even spell it.
