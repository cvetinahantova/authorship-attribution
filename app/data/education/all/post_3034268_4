If being educated is necessary to be an effective citizen, and therefore necessary for a democracy to be legitimate and effective, then should all voters be required to have a four year degree with a liberal education?  If that is the case, the government should pay for a higher education for all US Citizens, completely.  If this didn't happen, then the poor would lose their vote, which is clearly unacceptable.  If it is necessary for the security of the state and the liberty of its people to be educated, then the state, and taxpayers, have a duty to implement and pay for a system where everybody gets a higher education.  Furthermore, people must become aware of the  need  for a higher education.  If an individual does not desire or feel like they need to know something, they won't learn it.  A sense of urgency is required.  How can this be created?  Propaganda?  Where is the moral line there?
