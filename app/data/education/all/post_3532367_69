Gutted, betrayed, violated, raped, unclean. A mixture of emotions, expected when people find out the truth.     I actually feel as though I have cheated on Angela, not Sandra! I am devastated at the thought that I might lose her. The mixture of emotion is strange, new and scary. How can these feelings be so strong for someone? If only we knew.     One thing is for sure, I've let her and myself down and Angela is going to be the one left to pick up the pieces.     I hope we are strong enough to get through this.
