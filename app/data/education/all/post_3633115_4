I am actually finding random things that I would like to comment on, but when I go to blog, I forget what I wanted to write.  Then I feel as though I end up blogging some kind of junk that even I wouldn't really want to read.    I think I'm going to start writing down my thoughts or at least a brief idea of what I want to say.  That way, when I go to write something, I will have a list of things to choose from.  I have a pda, I might as well use it, right?  Whatever Gretchen, sure.  Just smile at the innocence, nod, and walk away.
