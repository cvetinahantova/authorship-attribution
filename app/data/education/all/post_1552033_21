I spent all day Saturday in Gamer's Heaven.  Well, all right, it was really only the 2003 Tokyo Game Show, but it felt like heaven to me!  The good news is gaming is alive and well and, judging from the huge crowds bubbling with enthusiasm, will be for a long time to come.  I saw previews and sampled demo programs for dozens of RPG style games, some 2D and some 3D, some humorous, some serious, some heavenly, some quaint, and all more highly addictive than designer drugs!  Who needs acid dreams when  urlLink Neverwinter Nights  is a mere mouse click away?  Why descend into alcoholism when  urlLink Lineage II  beta testing starts in a few weeks?  Why grab a shotgun and shoot up the local post office when  urlLink Ragnarok  is filled with monsters just waiting for you to take out your aggressions on them?  And, if you're short on cash, or just plain unwilling to pay for your fun,  urlLink Runescape  is free!  So what are you waiting for?   "Would you like to play a  urlLink game ?"
