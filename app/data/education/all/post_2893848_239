You have a habit of mischaracterizing points of view you don't agree with, Scott, and while it's mildly entertaining, so is it frustrating.  My point was not about "not being the Cubs" but about being a legitimage underdog.  In some regards, the Red Sox are to the Yankees as the White Sox are to the Cubs  (not all regards, not even many, but some).  The Cubs are quick to claim underdog status, but who is keeping them down, exactly?  It's a usurpation of sympathy and it isn't attractive.  Perhaps this is "well-tread ground" for a reason, "Scott."  But, of course, I'm not going to root for the Sox just to piss you off, however tempting it may be.  You're right: let's go to a game at each park this summer, take notes, and see what happens.
