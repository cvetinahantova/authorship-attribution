I really wish the media would stop refering to the Men's Olympic Basketball team as "The Dream Team."  They aren't.  Don't get me wrong, I fully support the team, but they aren't a Dream.  The only Olympic Basketball team that was a "Dream Team" was the first one, Magic, Michael, Larry et al.  That was a Dream team and could never be duplicated, no matter how hard USA Basketball tries.  Of course, they weren't the original Dream Team.  That was the 1980 US Hockey Team.  The way they won, and in the time it was, that was a grand Dream.  Watch the movie "Miracle"  I cry at the end every time!!!  If any team in this Olympiad is a "Dream Team" it's the US Softball Team.  They are now 7-0 and the top seed going into the Medal Round.  In four of the games, the mercy rule was invoked.  Oh, and by the way, the US team is yet to give up a run after facing the other seven teams in the competition.  Let me repeat that, NO ONE HAS SCORED AGAINST THE US TEAM!!!  So, in my opinion, they are the Dream Team, unless you have to face them, in which case they are the Nightmare Team.
