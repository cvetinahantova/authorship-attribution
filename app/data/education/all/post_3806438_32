In this week's  urlLink New York Magazine , Norman Mailer talks about George Bush and good strategies to get him out of office. One of his comments on Dubya summarizes exactly how I feel about Bush in better words than I've ever expressed it.   It could be that the most incisive personal crime committed by George Bush is that he probably never said to himself, “I don’t deserve to be president.” You just can’t trust a man who’s never been embarrassed by himself. The vanity of George W. stands out with every smirk. He literally cannot control that vanity. It seeps out of every movement of his lips, it squeezes through every tight-lipped grimace. Every grin is a study in smugsmanship.  Truer words have never been spoken.
