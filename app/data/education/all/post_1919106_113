urlLink Somebody shoot me    I spent all afternoon working on this cursed assignment. What I had to do was take the concrete architecture of Gnumeric, which we had constructed before based on our conceptual architecture. Now this isn't exactly difficult. But it's horribly tedious. One needs to go through nearly every file, weigh all the backwards dependencies, and choose which module they belong in. We had already done a rough job there, but the structure is rather horrible, and there are rogue dependencies to the left and the right. Not to mention that in case of most orphans (files that don't belong into the module they are in) don't show clear signs of where they should go. So one has to sift through the functions they contain, and then go through all the other files that use it, and find some indication as to where they belong.  Well, I had done a pretty good job fixing the top-level architecture, and was about to send it off to my lab partner. So I close the architecture viewer and copy the file up one directory to archive it and e-mail it off... And that's where I made the first mistake. Which turned out to be the last one too. Because the directory where I had run the viewer from was not the directory where the changelog was. No, it was the  backup  directory, and what I copied was the original file... Over the changelog. Hours,  hours  of work ruined in a second.
