I was being tortured by the  urlLink Wiggles  songs that were repeating in my head all morning. I mean, I made it through the morning routine without Alyssa actually asking to watch "Dorothy" but I still can't get the songs out of my head? It must have been from the DVD playing last night. Imagine a grown man sitting at his desk singing about cold spaghetti and boot-scooting. It's a scary thing. So I mentioned it to  urlLink Phil  and he reminded me about iTunes.  iTunes - God's gift to music-loving geeks . Needless to say, I cranked it up.     I'm feeling so much better now.
