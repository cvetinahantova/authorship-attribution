While playing xbox, Tiger Woods Golf 2003 last night, I was having a hard time putting.  I had made my shots at the stupid little hole at least 6 times, missing each time.     Will, my middle son, says "mom why don't you just constipate the hole"     He meant to say "mom, why don't you concede the hole."         Noah, the baby, talks with a worse southern slang than his momma, poor kid.  When his oldest brother called him a "redneck"  He replied with "I ain't not a redneck"   Casey, next to oldest son, trying to tell me about a conversation he heard on Jay Leno, tells me that the guy liked MILK. " Moms I Like to #*&%"    I think He meant to say MILF.   Same son's first word?  "Duh"   Seriously, I have it on video.     Noah asked me last night if babies really eat "mom juice", and where do they sell it.  When I told him, EEEEEWWWWWWWWWW. was his reply.   Jamie, walking in on mom and dad snuggled up in bed, trying to go to sleep, in our own bed, "why don't you two get a room"  our reply "we did."   TJ, after hearing a friend of mine belch out loud, in public, taco bell I think.  "that's just not right, she's not a girl.  Girls can't do that.  "  Friend's reply????? She belched again.  Only louder.      Children, they keep you young.
