jaelyn has strep throat --  i went to bed at 7 pm with some kind of monster headache --  lynn got very little sleep b/c i didn't / couldn't wake up with the kids --   i dreamed that four people called wanting to see our house.   in a separate and unrelated dream, I dreamed that i was *taking* a class with an odd conglomeration of faculty peers, high school friends, and church friends, and the teacher invited us to stand, turn in our hymnals and sing "victory in jesus" only when we stood up, everyone snickered and turned and looked at me.  There was an abominable smell, and everyone assumed that I had passed gas.  But I knew I hadn't so I didn't laugh.    And just then the room started getting woozy.  i started to lose conciousness (which is kind of wierd given that dream conciousness is a little different than waking conciousness -- isn't it?  maybe not inside the experience.).  So I ran / stumbled to the door for fresh air.    All around me, people were crashing to the ground, we were being poisoned.  I knew I should stop and help people, but I knew if I did, I wouldn't make it.  I could see the doors, but felt the pull of sleep heavily.  I made it only by throwing myself against the doors. Once they were opened the fresh air filled my lungs, I was immediately fine.   The dream continued, but I'll not.  I need to make some coffee.  Peace~
