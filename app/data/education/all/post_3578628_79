OK...when you're 16 years old and dealing with problems of your own, is it reasonable to be asked to be a parent for a year?  How about 6?  Maybe 12?  I don't know if any of you have had this problem, but I have my share of it and am quite sick of it.  Parenting is a thing for "Parents", wow, what a concept, not for their 16 year old son.  Life is tough, we all know it, our parents should know it too.  They have had plenty of experiences with life and how cruel and hard it can be, sooooooo, shouldn't they know how to deal with it a little bit better than say, our age of people?  Sure, watching your siblings for a few hours is fine, correcting them during that time is fine, but when your parents are there and PERFECTLY capable of doing all of that for themselves while you could be off doing something like...WORK (wait, maybe that's just me)...then why should they be able to complain about life and leave your siblings to you, especially when you have a younger sibling who is old enough to start taking over some responsibilities that you have had since, maybe,  5 !  I don't know if any of you are going to agree with me because none of you have probably had to deal with this, but I believe that there comes a time in a teenagers life when a parent should not be able to hold their son back from going and having a good time just because they can't deal with their 2 youngest children!!!!!!  As usual, I would always appreciate your comments on this matter.  Maybe I'm just being a baby, but frankly....I think they've just gone a bit too far!
