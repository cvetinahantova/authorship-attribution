urlLink Recent Reading Initiatives: Examples of National, State, and Professional Organizations' Efforts. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Shawna Brynildssen.  It takes a look at the various reading initiatives currently being tried around the USA.  From the ERIC Digest:  Statistics on the literacy skills of America's children reveal a disturbing situation. Approximately 40 percent of students across the nation cannot read at a basic level. And for low-income students, the figure is much worse (No Child Left Behind, 2002). In response to this situation, a number of efforts are underway-spearheaded by federal and state policymakers and a number of independent organizations-to remedy the situation. This Digest looks at some of the most recent of those initiatives.
