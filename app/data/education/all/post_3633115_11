Lately I have been hitting the gym with more regularity than most normal people ever do.  I'm actually pretty proud of myself for it.  Though the reasons for my doing it are probably not the best, but they seem to work for me.   1. I never lost all the weight after Shorty was born.  I am still 10 puonds over where I feel I should be.  I'll be happy with losing 5 and happier with 7, but 10 would be best.   2. S and I would like to have another baby soon, and I don't want to be "overweight" before I start gaining weight.   3. My mom has ballooned in recent years taking on the shape that my grandmother took in the last years of her life also.  Considering that my mom and I used to closet shop each others clothing, I realize that significant weight gain is likely a part of genetics.  I don't want to return to closet shopping with my mom, unless she comes back down to my size.  So I have begun exercising with vigor and even go alone, which is difficult when the gym on a college campus is filled with a bunch of 18 year olds wearing spandex that are looking for members of the opposite sex.  The best part, sad as it is to say, I got to show up some freshmen who thought they were too good to try certain styles of exercising.  Challenging a guy nearly 10 years my junior to try something and then watching him fail empowers me for some sad reason.    *maniacal grin*
