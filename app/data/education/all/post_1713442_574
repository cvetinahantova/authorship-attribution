urlLink Selecting and Retaining Teacher Mentors. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Bonnie B. Mullinix.  It views methods for finding and keeping good teacher mentors.  From the ERIC Digest:  The last decade has produced a great deal of literature and research documenting the importance of teacher mentors in teacher training and retention programs. This digest offers some collected wisdom regarding considerations and strategies for selecting and retaining teacher mentors. Related sub-issues of recruitment and compensation are also addressed. While presented in a sequential pattern, selection and retention of mentors are, in reality, integrated features of an on-going and spiraling process. Mentors continually cycle into and out of teacher education, induction and retention programs. The degree to which these critical participants are meaningfully engaged in the mentoring process may have a significant impact on a program's success.
