The radio anounces that hillary rodham is about to speak.  I've bowed before the blue glow god most of the afternoon.  with the rest of the day i've filled myself with corporate liquid sweetness (i.e. starbucks venti mocha frappachino).  What am I done with? art.  most all of it.  unless it... A) entertains me and/or provokes tangible reflection or mental stimulation or B) is a commercial/financial success  in: billboards, magazine ads, blimps, coke, mcdonalds, budweizer, thomas kinkade out:  jackson pollock, 'art' that isn't nice normal and clear like a photograph.  I am also done with wine. It is all wine to me.  don't talk about blah blah 1995, merlot, blah, blah, rich, dry, blah, blah it's wine, you can describe it, say whatever you want to, but all i hear is, "wine?  wine wine wine wine.  wine wine wine." And wine is red.  If you pour me something that isn't red that you call wine, I'll pour it either on the ground or your face and call you a fool.  also, what hasn't coke bought the moon and made a huge billboard out of it?  i would.  a huge "coke" light in the sky.  that's money baby.  throw down a cool bill and make a spaceship and make the moon say "coke'  it's that simple.  matt miller wants me to go to estonia and russia with him, billy and dan want me to go to mexico and cuba with them.  trevor wants me to go to vietnam and thailand with him.  I think I'll do it all and just be poor.
