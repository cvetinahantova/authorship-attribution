Minor tragedy struck tonight when a CD got stuck in my fancy CD Recorder machine - the one attached to my stereo system (vs. computer).  This beloved machine has made a million CD mixes over the past 5 years or so.  I may be able to salvage it if I can open it up, but I don't have my toolbox right now. Regardless, I may have caused Shaken CDR Syndrome by shaking it and tipping it upside down, etc.  The cruel joke is that it happened while I was taking a song or two off a disc I wanted to sell - a hideous BRANDY CD! I know, I know...  Anyway, pray my box that makes music.
