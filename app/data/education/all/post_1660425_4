As I read through the article, I thought about my own school.  How difficult would it be to re-create such a website for Russellville High School?  Do we have the technology and the expertise?  I don't see why not.  With the help of EAST Lab, I am sure that our school could develop a user-friendly, community based website for students, teachers, and community members to access and make the school a real part of the community.  I browsed through some of the Beacon school website and was impressed by the professional quality and ease of access.  Many clubs and sports were linked as well as individuals "homepages".  I thought about what a wonderful resource this would be for the community.  For example, let's say a family is about to move to Russellville.  They could access the school's page and explore the school system they are about to enter.  I current district and school webpages are underdeveloped, hard to "explore", and do not make the community feel a part of the school.  We have simply not stuck to a vision of a plan.  We have grasped at the air to try and integrate the Internet into the school community.  I think with a clear vision and a dedication to make it a reality, a project similar to this would be possible for Russellville High School.  BC
