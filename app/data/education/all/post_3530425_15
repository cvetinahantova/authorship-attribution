If you were going to write a book (and I think you want to), what kind of book would it be?  What would it be about?  Me, I'd either publish a book of wittily insightful philosophy gleaned from my years of experience on this planet.  Or, I'd write a romance novel.  In truth, I'm not qualified to write either one, if experience counts.                      **********  Well folks, I'm a smoker.  To make myself feel better about it, I'll smoke Winstons (no additives).  I didn't mean to become a smoker--it just happened.  I especially like to smoke on the steps outside my back porch.  When the cicadas have gone to bed, it's really nice back there.    If I had $1000 to spend, I'd hire someone to clear out the honeysuckle back there, and make room for the native species--the dogwood and the redbuds.  Now, the f-ing honeysuckle crowds them out.  Damn.                      **********  Wow!  Blogging may just become my new substitute for schoolwork!
