Well, I wish. I have been continuing my run over at  urlLink Pokerroom.com . I started out with $1,000 in play money and now I am up at $115,000. It is unbelievable. I am the luckiest person alive. There is no way to explain it.   In fact, I am feeling so damned lucky, that I am going to predict the Powerball numbers. So what the hell, here is my prediction for the upcoming Powerball numbers.       4   15   21   22   47    18       There they are with the first five being the white and last one being the powerball. If someone wins with this combination, please tell everyone at the press conference about this blog.  Thank you and goodnight.
