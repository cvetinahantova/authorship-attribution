Hello,  Almost didn't write anything, but between switching channels between Iron Chef and Road Rules, I thought I needed to do something positive.  Went grocery shopping today.  Bought things for cooking on the grill tomorrow.  I marinated some steaks, and ribs.  I bout some marinade that is really spicy.  I didn't realize that untl I tasted it.  LOL.    Caught up with a good friennd via phone.  We joked for a while, then went on our seperate ways.     Song of the Day:   Where My Girls At? by 702.  Why?  I just saw the vidoe, and I wanted to hear something that wasn't sad sounding.  LOL
