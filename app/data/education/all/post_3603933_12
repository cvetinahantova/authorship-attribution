Spent the day driving up North to Kaleva with Kara, then back to Lansing.   We went to pick up Kara's three dogs - Roo, Dark Star, and Kya (sp?).  Kara and Jay are moving back to the Lansing area (which I am VERY happy about!) and she has been driving back and forth like crazy to take care of the dogs for a couple of days and then come back here to work on the house her and Jay are fixing up.  Today we were going to bring all three dogs back with us as they have the kennel ready at their new house.  Didn't exactly work out how we had expected.  We got to the house after a three hour drive.  Dark Star and Roo got in a massive dog fight.  It was crazy and very scary.  It was crazy because these dogs have been together the last four years.  They are very cool dogs - one is a beautiful Husky and the other a Lab/Shepard mix.  Then there is Kya, a big version of Bali, and super sweet.  They all love each other.  But today Roo was having dominance issues or something.  Kara put down some food for the dogs and Dark Star and Roo started fighting over it.  And I mean really fighting, locked onto each other.  Kara was screaming at the dogs and trying to separate them, I was screaming at Kara to not get right in the middle because I was scared to death she would get hurt - that they would bite her trying to get to one another.  We tried everything to get them apart and finally Kara got ahold of Roo and threw him in the other room and we slammed the door to separate the two.  Kara had blood all over her khakis, her floors - Dark Star's beautiful face is really cut up.    Needless to say, we couldn't bring them all back in the same car.  We brought Roo back and left the other two up north- Kara and Jay are going back Friday to get them.  She is afraid that she can't ever put the two dogs together again.  So I'm interested to hear how they do on Friday.    Definitely a day I will remember.  It was very nice spending so much time with Kara too.
