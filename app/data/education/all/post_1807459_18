Well here I am in the PC room again.  I think this is the PC that one of my student's mother hosts.  But I don't think that the lady here right now is her.  I find myself here b/c Scott asked me to write an article for the LIKE faces catalog or whatever you'd call it.  I'm sure you guys will have chance to tear it apart and make fun of it in the not too distant future.  Today was a good day though.  I had some really awesome classes.  It is always great when you have a class with some decent meaningful conversation.  Today we had a lesson dealing with presidents.  One of the questions in the text was "if you were president what would you do?"  There were some really good answers such as, one student said she'd reduce the school week to five days.  Another said she'd make prayer mandatory in school.  I was impressed.  On a really funny note I had to work with Dedra.  I can't believe that Michelle not only worked with her but lived with her for almost an entire year.  That is amazing.  I think one day of work was enough for me.  That is all I'll say about that.  Getting back on a more positive note the students at my school are so well behaved that it is scary.  These kids are just great.  I would say I had some good classes before but nothing like this.  I'm not sure why this is the case but I'll take it.
