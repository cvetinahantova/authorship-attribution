okay, so some of you know that i used to work in a grocery store in the past. i was a cashier and that meant that i almost always had to bag the groceries for the customers (possibly the worst part of the job). everyone and their mother would complain. too many things in a bag, not enough, not separated properly (my personal pet peeve would be the people who stand and watch me bag everything myself and then when i'm finished, go ahead and change whatever items should be changed, i almost killed a few of those people). but i'm off topic. what i'm trying to say is, i have some sort of training and understanding of how the average grocery bag should be packed, and of course it's pretty obvious. heavy things on the bottom, light on the top, frozen separate, and pretty much put similar things in with each other. korea, in my opinion, has yet to master this basic understanding.  i seriously don't know what it is, but it is presumed that the less bags the better, and i don't mean three bags instead of four or five. i mean one bag instead of four or five (and you do pay for the bags, just in case you were thinking they are only trying to save money). in fact, i know people who have went to the store to buy multiple things, they have asked for more bags and the cashier has said no. i've had bags rip on the way home. i've had the handles cutting of circulation to my fingers while i carry them. this really has to stop. i mean, two or three bags is okay people.  care and i have a system down now. i carry the bag and she carries a couple of the heavier items (such as juices and the like) in her arms. it's not perfect, but at least i can make it home safely. come on, i'm paying for the bag. i'll even pay double. it's only five cents. just let me have another one.
