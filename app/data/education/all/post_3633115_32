The FM radio in my car is now working! Hooray for Pioneer to make the RCA and internal Amp run on different circuits (or whatever the actual way to phrase that is).  S might have killed the radio, but it turned out he only killed the internal amp.  So all we had to do was go buy an amp hook it up and now I have radio  and a CD player too!  It's also XM capable, so we will eventually be hooking that up as well.  Happy! Happy! Joy! Joy!   The car only had AM radio until S bought and hooked up the new radio.  The funny part.....the AM doesn't work on the new radio! I just think that is hilarious.
