I'm so busy with projects.  Finals are stressful.  I did want to write something though.  I like writing.  it releaves my stress some.    Tried the iced tea from Starbucks.  It tastes  NASTY!!!!   LOL.  Thank God I bought the tall, instead of the grande.  This thing is awful.  I've tasted bad tea before.  I don't like this one.  I know it's only my opinion, but it is what it is.    Didn't want to do anything but rest today, but I had to press on.  I have things to do.  Got myself though my image project.  I have a big test on Thursday, and after than I still have two fianals to finish.  I'd love to add better links to this page, seeing as how I have started editing the code.  It's a pity, cause I end up being pulled in so many directions.  I don't want "Comfort Zone" to be a casualty.    Oh, I promised myself that after I finish my classes for the semester, I'm make a better homepage.  LOL  I want it to look good.
