I'm back.  I think the best way to describe my feelings towards being back on the mainland is by using everyone's favorite internet emotional gesture :(.  I enjoy the folks in these here parts, but Hawaii is Hawaii.  In almost cool news, as many of you know, I missed eating next to Sir Willie Nelson in the little Mauian town of Paia by twenty frigging minutes.  My mom blessed her self with the condensation left by his water glass.  Oye vey.  I'm about to make my July music mix.  I'll post a setlist when I'm finished.  Jesse
