Neil and Tim's  urlLink album cover .  Tim is looking old, but Neil always manages to look the same!  I purchased their new EP from iTunes and I am relieved to say the songs are good.  All 3 are strong in melody and lyric - and none have the airy Maori sound of Neil's solo work over the last few years.
