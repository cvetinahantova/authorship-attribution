Unfortunately due to taking on this new job, i'll have to cancel a plannde trip to the states. Oh well. No huge loss i guess. I'm goignt to accept that this was part of God's plan for me, so i'll have to accept it. Also means i'm gonna have to alter the date of the ski trip. DAMN! I hate skiing during school holidays, the queues are horrendus! Such is life.  Just visited the shipoffools forums. Man there are some bizarre critters out there. Or maybe they're all normal and i'm the one who's crazy. Actually that is quite a likely scenario.  Ellie has been set as my JT's coleader for beach mission this year. Woohoo! First time in four years that there has been a female section leader for JT's, as well as the fact that she is WAY more organised than i am, so the running may be some what less last minute. Admittedly last year there were some extenuating circumstances, but still, i should have done better than that.  Currently sitting at Matchrix and i'm NOT playing games. Seem to have sort of lost the passion for them at the moment. Also Bizarre. I'm sure the urge will come back.  Playing guitar tonight on Worship. Glenns leading so i finally get to plug in my acoustic and give the pickup a good run. Also got Korey tonight which is good. I'm due for an early one after the last couple.
