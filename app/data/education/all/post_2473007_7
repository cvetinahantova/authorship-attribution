The sun peered through the crytal sky Shafting down upon a world. Filled with towering beasts and untold wonders And skies with clouds unfurled.   Across the vast expanse of white and hard Plains gashed with mysterious monuments- Deep circles of black often raging with unseen heat- Came wanderers from below.   They marched across the desert, scorched by the heat Of the unknown as they pressed on Toward the looming corpse, The newly found victuals.   Out of the shadows, without warning, moved the giant. The looming beast hurled a giant foot And the party disbanded as soldiers were flung and crushed At the unknown whim of receding Colossus.
