Yay today is National Day! Happy Birthdae Singapore!! Another boring boring day for me, spent the day eating, slping and doin work... not much of a lifestyle yah... watched NDP on TV and Singapore idol... woot it rawks as a comedy show haha... simply hilarious.... some s'poreans can b so thicked skinned tsk tsk.... haha but it makes good primetime viewership anyway hah Tmr goin for Class 1704's first successful class outing yeah! but sadly I got to miss half of a soccer session wif da soccer peeps... actually... I would rather stay at lam soon the entire day with dem but since I already told the class I was goin, I can't pang seh them... I would feel terrible and guilty... hai... too bad I gave them confirmation too early if not I can tell them i can't make it... no doubt I would have alot more fun with my soccer khakis I think they are the most fun people to be with in the entire world haha... keep up the Wu Zhong spirit guys!! yeAh!! Hope I have fun tmr...
