though this night may seem to be the end of me and the bruises i carry brings me to the floor again i will survive you as i have before and know this new look fucker for i have finally crossed that line  i am not a weak woman though sometimes you made me feel it but the raw pain has broken through my fear of you like an animal caged the master shall know the true meaning of rage as i scope for weaponry  there is a resolve born  of my relation to countless women through the ages that found themselves liberated in the dawn from a long line of worthless men   Â©2002 DC Vision
