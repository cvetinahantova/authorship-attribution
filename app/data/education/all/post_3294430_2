i'm down with flu today. actually it started on monday. the pain was like being on a rack. i took some aspirin and the pain subsided for a day. today the pain is back. i'm still going to training because there'll be a briefing on our duties for the competition on sunday but i still intend to train tonight. am i trying for sepupuku? will just have to see later how much my mental toughness can push my physical self.
