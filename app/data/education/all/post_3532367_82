Having slept quite well, it was up early for work. I got an odd comment from Sandra about being late back, but with the people I was supposed to be with, it was covered well. I am hoping to be able to make Thursdays a regular event, with cover from me going out with friends.  Â   I had time off this afternoon to enable me to go to the counsellor appointment. Got there, having had to book 2 hours off work, only to be told she had gone off sick. I am still really pissed off about it.   Apparently they treid to get hold of me, but I have to ring back on Monday to re-schedule.
