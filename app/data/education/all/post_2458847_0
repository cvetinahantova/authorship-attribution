I like the snow. This blizzard is kind of a blessing for me. Walking in, and marveling at the snow this evening, my mind, probably staying with the theme "good things", started to move to St. Petersburg, Russia where this summer I had the experience of venerating the relics of  urlLink St. Xenia of Petersburg ...the fool for Christ.    urlLink This isn't my picture , in fact...it's much better than the one I took there. I began by walking through an almost empty graveyard, with just a few old women praying by the grave sides of departed husbands, mothers and fathers. After a short walk I came upon  the chapel that houses St. Xenia's coffin and holy relics. This Friday morning there were a couple of women outside of the chapel lighting candles and praying to St. Xenia. I walked around the side of the tiny chapel to find the door... upon walking in I was surprised to find the place packed with people. As I walked in and got on line to venerate the relics, a priest and what appeared to be part of the choir from his parish came into the chapel.  Almost immediately the choir went to a little "choir loft" and the priest began a panakhida . Suddenly the chapel was filled with prayers for the reposed and the choir beautifully and loudly chanting "Gospodi Pomilui!"(Lord, have mercy!) Really a tremendous experience...to witness all of this devotion. After finally leaving the chapel I made my way out of the cemetery, this time going a different route. At the cemetery's exit I came to a couple of old women begging for some money. After giving them a few rubles they gratefully crossed themselves and prayed for me... I couldn't help but think of St. Xenia's days spent wandering and praying around that very spot.
