My philosophy behind this is... Each time I want to do something, I am going to ask a different person when they are going to be free.  That way nobody is always left out.  I post the plan about three or four days ahead of time.  I did with Anchorman, Spider Man 2, and I posted a week in advance the date for Dodgeball.  Then as we close in, I IM people to let them know that it's still happening.  I then begin to call people on the phone.  It's very complicated and I can't help but be happy when things work out.  Like Anchorman, the 4th time planned and it was awesome.  I was so happy to be there.  Now I don't think it's fair for people to blow up at me when they can't go.  I would like to ask you to not get angry with me because right now I don't have the power to be able to just know when you are free.  I don't have anyone's calendar so I don't know where you will be this week or the next.  I do my best.  On the issue of inviting people and surprising you, I don't think it matters.  I showed up with Demi.  You didn't know.  Well, here's an added perk.  You get to see an old friend.  (One that I enjoy talking with any chance I get.)  I showed up with Rachael.  Okay, Josh R...I can understand how that might peeve you but I'm really good friends with her now.  And she's a part of my life now and with Demi, here's a surprise perk.  Meet Rachael...you've seen her in German and she really likes hanging with people like us.  I love planning things and getting people together.  I don't work a job.  I don't usually have very busy days.  That's why I come up with all these things to do and then try to plan them.  If you can't do them, just say no.  You aren't out of the group if you miss something.  Well that's what I think.  You don't need my permission to comment.
