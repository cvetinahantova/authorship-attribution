urlLink    This just happened to be one of those lucky moments where you're walking along and you spy a great shot. So I grabbed the digital and snapped this one.  What caught my eye was the shiny wallpaper. It creates a cross-like effect with the light and the rich red floor really seems to compliment the orange wallpaper in the top left hand side. I ran it through a slight lomo effect, but most of the dark edges/light center in this photo are natural.Â  urlLink
