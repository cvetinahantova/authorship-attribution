One of the minor items in the news over the past couple of days is that the government is supposed to be about to  urlLink set a date for the turn-off of analogue radio .  It is bound to be at least fifteen years away, or at least I would hope so, but there are various estimates that around 100 million analogue receivers are in use in the UK.  I use four or five on a regular basis myself (one on my MP3 player, another very small pocket one, a clock-radio in the bedroom, and one each in the living room and bathroom).  I guess it is time to buy another gadget.  At least  urlLink Xfm  is available on digital radio in my area, I'd be much more upset if it wasn't.  Nevertheless, surely this is a monumental landmark in broadcasting?  More so, I'd say, than the switching off of analogue television.  Or perhaps I am just a sad geek and it is of no import whatsoever.  In tech news, both  urlLink The Register  and  urlLink News.Com  report that Cisco is buying an offshoot of Imperial College (where I studied for three years then worked in the computer centre for seven years).  As an aside, why does Amazon estimate that a delivery dispatched today by first class post will not arrive until the 12th?  Are they just being realistic about the state of the post office at the moment?
