urlLink    This is a doll I made for Jonathan during his Samuri obsession (which I think is a current thing).  He went to see The Last Samuri and wouldn't stop talking about it, hence the Samuri.  She has dark hair and green eyes per his request (though if it had been up to me she'd have had brown eyes).  Posted by  urlLink Hello
