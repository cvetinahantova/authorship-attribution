urlLink Scientists say eating far less food will extend your lifespan . They even go as far to say,   "In the fractious field of aging research, the benefit of reducing calories is one of the few areas of agreement. This means much more than just skipping dessert. It's taking relatively severe steps, such as slashing calories by as much as two-thirds or eating only every other day, which increases life span, studies suggest."   As a person that once only ate one meal per day with no snacking at all, I find it would be very difficult to not succumb to eating at least one thing per day. Of course, that is not to say that I do not believe it will work. So as I sit here doing nothing productive, I feel I might as well try out the extreme experiment. So from this point on I will not eat anything else the entire day and continue that every other day.  Another related note is that there is  urlLink another study suggests many cosmetic items actually might cause cancer . (Sorry, for the registration thing. Just use ihateregistration@dumpit.com as e-mail and thissucks as password)  Unlike the first story, I don't believe that these items are the cause of cancer. It is more of the person using them than the products themselves. In my personal belief, the people using these are very stressed about their love lives and thus resort to using cosmetics to attract that story book lover. When they cannot find this person, they result to becoming increasingly more stressed about their lives. With more and more stress, the body develops some agents that fight and fight against itself which results in cancer. Of course I am no doctor nor am I even intelligent, so what do I know?
