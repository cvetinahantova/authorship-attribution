Work:  Well lately I have been extemely busy trying to finish off the school year. I am happy to say that today was my last day. Thank God. Actually, the day felt weird not having kids around. All teachers went to school today and cleaned out the classrooms and checked out with the principal. I learned a lot through my long term assignments and everyone at the school was really helpful and nice. I hope I can get hired soon! I won't be subbing until september when school is back in session, although I will be working at an art camp for 5 weeks in the summer. I am really looking foward to this! My friend told me that it is a lot of fun.  Prayer Request:  I pray that God give me strength to deal with my issues. Many of you already know what I am talking about. Thank you. I pray that God give me provision and wisdom to be able to discern and make better decisions. The waiting game is hard and I am trying to trust in God alone.   Books that I am reading:   The Bible            by  God Idols of the Heart  Learning to Long for God Alone  by Elyse Fitzpatrick How Can I change? Victory in the Struggle Against Sin  by C.J. Mahaney The Remarkable Women of the Bible and Their Message For Young Life Today by Elizabeth George  Scripture to meditate on:  According to Psalm 18:30, the Word of God is flawless . This means that whatever God says is perfect. No one will ever be able to refute His promises.   "True, the grass withers and the wildflowers fade, but our God's Word stands firm and forever ." (Isaiah 40:8/Message Bible) What God said when He created the heavens and the earth applied yesterday, pertains to today and will be relevant tomorrow.   If you hear God's Word and believe it, you are blessed because  it is at work inside of you!  Prayer: Lord Jesus, before I start this day, I put on Your Armor. As I buckled the belt of truth around my waist, I ask You to reveal Your truth throughout the day when the line of fact and fiction becomes blurred. As I put on the breastplate of righteousness, I ask that You guard my heart with the integrity that only comes from You. As I place my feet in the shoes of Your Good News, help me to walk in a peace that passes all understanding. And when the enemy tries to negotiate with me, help me to foil his wheeling and dealing by keeping the shield of faith firmly in place. Because I realize that one blow to my confidence can prove fatal, I accept the gift of Your salvation and put it on like a helmet. And finally, I pick up the sword of the Spirit. I ask that You bring Your Word to remembrance so that I can skillfully and accurately pierce holes in the enemy's intimidations. Amen!
