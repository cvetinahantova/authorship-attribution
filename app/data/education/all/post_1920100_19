Good Morning!  Well I just got done reading my devotional for the day. It talked about the habit of keeping a clear conscience. "...strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men" (Acts 24:16). It explained that when we have God's truth in our minds and relevant we will be able to make the right choices and hear God. I was thinking of times when I did things not knowing why but just felt moved by the Spirit to act a certain way. Everytime I chose to listen to the spirit blessings were being poured out. But, on the flip side there are those times that our flesh is stronger than brick and we fail to listen to God and sometimes choose not to. I am just grateful and amazed by God's undying Love for me and for his mercy and grace in my life.  Today  I am meeting with the pastor from church. I am going to start being counseled by some women from church. Pray that it goes well. I am nervous about the whole thing. Shannon some girl from church is going to be there.  This weekend  is going to be interesting for me. My brother asked me to help him babysit his triplets with him because his wife is leaving to Chicago for the weekend to attend her brother's wedding. I know the time is going to be blessed. I will be at my brother's house Friday and Saturday.  " I am a child of God "(Romans 8:16) Wow I can't even grasped that!
