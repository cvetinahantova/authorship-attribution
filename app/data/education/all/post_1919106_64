Up up down down left right left right   I've been feeling a bit down lately. I guess it's just now that I've begun to realize how little time I got left here with my friends, and how fast that time is running away. In a way I wish I could be like  Death  in Terry Pratchett's novel, "Reaper Man": In that story Death is about to be retired by the Auditors, which are entities that despise individuality... The basic rundown is that at one point Death finds the hourglass with his own name, and when asked what he was going to do with it, Death responded "I'M GOING TO SPEND IT." I wish that I could do the same, being able to spend time without having to worry about the consequences... But I'm stuck being myself, always worrying about consequences, always wondering if I could have done things differently... And then there are those happy times like last week when I forget about everything that's wrong and just wish that time would just stop on that one happy moment. And I've had a great deal of happy moments since I got back from Canada... Probably more than I've ever had before. *sigh* I'm going to miss this place.
