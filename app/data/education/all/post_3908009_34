ok yea the title has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with this blog. lol. it just seemed funny.  i'm trying to stay funny to stay sane. i might blow up soon. theres too much shit going on. i know i can help all of it and just stop everything and fix it. but i cant bring myself to do any of that. i think i have to throw up. i honestly feel sick to my stomach. my brains going to just pop. i'm not going to do anything extreme like kill myself beucase thats stupid. plus suicide is a sin. i cant afford to screw up the good deeds i've been doing for the past little while. [good deeds? yea right!]  so anyways, on a lighter note, the BBQ went great! fireworks were amazing. i still cant believe sweden won though. i was rootin for spain, but oh well, next year i guess. i was lying bout 2 feet away from the water and i was watching fireworks in the sky. it was amazing! cept for the fact that i kept thinking bout how much fun wednesday was. when i wasnt lying on my cousin but on my mooshie. THAT was good(Y)  thas it for now  i feel like shit
