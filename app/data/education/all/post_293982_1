unfortunately i realized im now too awake to go back to bed, but not awake enough to go to work.  so im warming yesterday's coffee and settling down to post.    urlLink      Blog Roundup   I updated my links on the side of the page, and decided to use my  urlLink LJ  to put stuff i dont want to put on here. LJ will also do password protected stuff, and as an additional feature, I love the  urlLink "friends"  page.  Every LJ I read regularly, I'll friend, and then be able to look at on one page.  Granted, I'm still not good at keeping up with anyone's.       urlLink amy 's site hasn't changed much - except i feel that i disagree with her more. i guess that can all come crashing down when i write my book - why i'm not a libertarian.  I do have to give libertarian's credit - aside from having great internship programs, many of them also actually think about their views and can explain, defend, and discuss them.  So they deserve much respect.   urlLink Julian  in that same vein, also keeps up both his own personal notes, but also Reason's  urlLink Hit and Run .   Now, on to those of my friends wandering around the world... urlLink Aaron ,  urlLink Carissa , and  urlLink Erin  are all in Hong Kong/Thailand, via Japan, Japan, and Holland respectively.  Aaron will be back in about 2 weeks, and his boxes will arrive at my work in a few months :).  I'm, by the way, ecstatic about aaron being back.   urlLink Jenny  returns from her  urlLink polish scam  in a few days, only to run off to  urlLink yet another avoidance of real life  in a few weeks.    A newish friend,  urlLink Gwen , is wandering around hollywood, looking for a cure for entropy and poor reality TV, and  urlLink Stina  is enjoying her 77 day weekend, this time in Maine, fresh off her visit to my house.   urlLink Storey  is still being cryptic out on the left coast, and is currently on phone strike from me.  Wanna know what that means?  Return messages, and you will :).    urlLink James  Layman is on my list of friends because he's moving closer, and i want to entertain him while he's wasting away at GULC.  GLUG even.  And i can do dances for both him and for brenda, who's in the night program.    Finally, Andrea isn't updating for the summer, and Neil seems to have hit a snag in his job-hunting, and so is now law-student hunting.    Those are the blogs I try to read regularly.  I occasionally read Dave Barry's blog (but im reading it during the convention because of his fight with the Post) and other such staples.  Perhaps as I up my time at my desk, I'll find some more.    Seven minute break   I'm not talking about this here, but I'm moderating.  Keeping count even, to adjust my habits.  Its working, and it will work to eliminate, someday.     Work Roundup  The big boss, in my boss' weekly "call" said "Kate seems to be much happier in her new job.  She even seems to fit in well, even though she's not black."  I thought this was hysterical, especially since the other members of my office and I share many racial views, and other political views.  Even though I mockingly "mess up the color scheme of the office" I do fit in well.  ( urlLink Menckles  could probably relate, if she knew i had a website)  Keith also commented that as soon as I moved jobs, I seemed to get an attitude that matched my other office mates - I remarked it was always there, but the attitude was unable to be expressed in my other position.  All in all, I'm having a good time, but BTS is about to start.  8/4 - shit hits the fan :).  I also had such a great customer service call last night - I could even answer her questions about where to find the Virginia Standards of Learning for Physics.  Finally, Nina sends me this  urlLink gem  - poor woman got a disciplinary hearing, but if we all read her book, we'd all see that she was right :).  Alright, no more stalling - time to shower, go to the sev for more coffee, and then the train to DC.
