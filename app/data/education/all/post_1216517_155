Man, I saw a great rock and roll show last night.  Richard Swift, man.  http://www.richardswift.us  He's a musican.  Mind blowing instumentalization and harmony.  Really hypnotizing, ya know.  There are certain albums that put me in a trance-like state: Sea Change, Rush of Blood, Amnesiac, Kid A, Play, 18.  I don't listen to 'trance' music and don't have a desire to but I love to zone out to albums.  I always put on music when I go to bed.  I think I listened to Getz/Gilberto every night for like a year straight.  That was what kicked it off.  I started listening to it in Ukraine of all places.  Those hypnotic albums are the bee's knees for me come bed time.  If anybody can recommend any other bitchin' zone-out albums let me know.  Pet Sounds, Dark Side are good too.
