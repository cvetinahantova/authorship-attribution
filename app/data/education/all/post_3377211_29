urlLink    Best movie of the Summer?  Yup.  Am I seeing it again tomorrow?  You betcha.  Without a doubt, the biggest reason why Spiderman does so well is the storytelling that occurs in the film.  Here you have a hero whom is struggling with his two identities and how Peter Parker just wishes that he could STOP being Spiderman.  There are a lot of themes presented here than many other kinds of movies which ultimately resonate with viewers.  It's easy to see the conflicts between characters and even conflicts within themselves as being more entertaining than the action.  If people wanted straight-up action with their superheroes, look no further than Van Helsing.  If you want a good story, then this is your movie.  It's interesting how both movies deal with heroes and villains, yet both are presented in completely different ways.  Just my two cents.  Oh, and the reasoning behind the title?  Doc Ock was played brialliantly by Alfred Molina.  This is Michael Clarke-Duncan as Kingpin good, or Ian McKellan as Magneto good.  Not Jack Nicholson as the Joker good.  But infinitely better than Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze.  And the reason why I have testicles?  Because apparently I'm on my best friend's "poop" list because I saw this without him.  Hey fool, thanks for going to see Napoleon Dynamite without me.Â  urlLink
