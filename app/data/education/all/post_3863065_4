what if I were just to pack up and go? I mean, just leave Japan and not look back...well I know for one, I would probably need 4 suitcases and possibly a 5th.  I would have one full pay check and just under a half of another.  so needless to say, just enough to get me home but not enough to get me anywhere else.  I would actually have to get a real job and go back to the real world...almost scary!!  But tempting enough to do it.  You know, I could leave, just take everything I could carry and stay home when I go, but that would be mean and then I really wouldn't have any money...I mean, sure I will get a full paycheck just before I go, but that isn't who I am!! I can't just up and leave the job!  Today was hot again...I don't think the country never cools down...at least not in the summer.  It was still +30C at 7:00pm this evening and it's driving me crazy!!  Did get my airconditioner into my apt, but do not have anything to block the wide opening where the door doesn't close, so I will go at least one more night without the stupid thing..sigh!  Somedays I wish I was back in my old apt and old job with my friends.  At my one class, in a private home, the mom gave me a huge tea cake, with raisins on it and two 1 litre bottles of coffee..neither of which I like, I mean the cake too, so I shared it at my office.  The coffee drinks stayed there for our next staff meeting.  I think the secretary might be angry with me because I was a little short with her on the phone yesterday.  For the past month we have been talking about what days our holidays are on, so I made plans for those days.  And yesterday I found out that NO, I am not off on that day because since I am the new teacher I have to work extra, so now my plans are cut short and I actually have to leave my friends place earlier then expected...sigh, not fun!
