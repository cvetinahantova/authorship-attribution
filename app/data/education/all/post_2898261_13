Based on another dream   Realigning my thoughts again Demons tangoing in my mind Angels screaming in my mind Thoughts jumbled, leaving me behind Heart falls to the floor Still beating as it descends Broken and battered I am Here in my shadows it begins Shards of broken glass Flowing through my veins Crystallizing it Then inhale the pain Monsters in my closet  Creatures under the bed Snow white is dissected The seven dwarves are dead No fairy tale happy ending Blood sprayed across the wall In non-geometric designs From a tripping mad mans mind Ligaments crash with sinew Muscles fall from bones Tongue swollen inside Despite the devils I’m alone Copper taste feels my mouth Smell of burnt hair in the air Screams building in my throat What the hell is going on here Let me go now to oblivion  Let me embrace the end It’s quieter and safer there I can’t do this again… again
