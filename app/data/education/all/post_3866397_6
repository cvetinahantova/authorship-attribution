Ah, nothing like the madness of a Monday work day to jerk you out of the serene weekend mood.  I finally broke down and had one of those cold Starbucks espresso drinks, and I'm hoping that it will either energize or kill me.  I'm not sure which I'd prefer at this point.  I decided that Monday will be my movie review day.  Being a Netflix user, weekends are great opportunities to catch up on my viewing list.  Here are the movies I saw this weekend.  Not all are new movies, so bear with me.  Ratings are out of five possible stars.  My Big Fat Greek Wedding:  I was entertained.  It was funny enough to keep me interested, and the romance wasn't too formulaic and in-your-face.  The whole crazy family concept went over well enough to make the movie interesting.  Plus it was short.  With everybody deciding in recent years that it's not a movie if it's not over two hours, it's nice to see a short, simple movie.  Three and half stars.  The General's Daughter:  I've decided that John Travolta should only play military characters from now on.  Look at the evidence folks- Broken Arrow (not his best, but good), Basic (one of my favorite movies), and The General's Daughter.  This was an excellent movie.  Somewhat twisted, but excellent overall.  Travolta is just way too convincing in these types of roles, and his quirkiness keeps it from getting stale.  It helps that he's a pretty convincing tough guy as well.  If only Battlefield: Earth had been about the military.  Nah, it still would have been horrible.  Four stars.  That was it for this weekend.  Tomorrow's post will be my political/economic post for the week.
