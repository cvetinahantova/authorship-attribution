Breaking one's foot sucks, to put it mildly.  Friday's surgery was to repair the tendon (that was what I heard break), and to attempt to fix the bone.  Apparently, the bone was shattered to such an extent that it wouldn't hold a screw, therefore, my foot is full of some kind of wire mesh designed to hold the bone in place.    I had my first shower since Thursday today,  boy did it feel good, but I am stuck in bed with my foot propped up.  Hubby and boy child are being terrific about it, and they are really helping me out.   I will, unfortunately, miss Monday's  interviews for a new principal.  And that pisses me off to no end.  I don't dare try to go, though.    sigh   hard to get comfortable at the computer, hard to get comfortable in bed, hard to get comfortable period.   Oh well, life goes on...
