An estimated  urlLink 82,000 people , including many from mainland China, gathered in Hong Kong to remember the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing 15 years ago.  Small groups of two or three were arrested in the Tiananmen throughout the day.  Let us never forget the horrific crushing of a nonviolent pro democracy movement in Beijing on June 4, 1989, and hope that the people of China will very soon have the democracy that those students died for.
