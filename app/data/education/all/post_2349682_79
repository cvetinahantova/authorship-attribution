I hate it when you get up super early and can't get back to bed, it happened to me this morning. I didn't go to bed till 1 and I got up at 6! ARGH! No fair! I went to see what's going on with my registration today for school, my counselor yelled at me because she thought that I had only taken one science and she had told me a couple of times that I needed to get two sciences done before third semester, because I failed sciences my freshman year. It was just a really bad year, I still have to pay for it weird how that works. I was confused because I knew I took them. Luckily after I called her on it I was right, I just don't like getting yelled at. Daddy took me to lunch today, I look forward to Dad times during the week because we can talk about everything. I think it is so important if you are a parent to spend time with your kids individually, my dad does a good job at this. I got to eat Mexican food which I had been craving for a couple of weeks in Ireland. In youth group tonight I was given the opportunity to pray with a girl who was having some problems, I thought it was the greatest thing that she was comfortable enough with me to share her struggles, God is so cool in how he asks us to do his work. Like I loved being in a different country but God is using us in our own country as well! That's so cool! Right on! I was also blessed by some of the youth coming up to me and telling me that they missed seeing me around. How awesome is that?! Oh the cutest thing in the world was when I saw my brother Gabe when I got home from Ireland and he told me that he had learned a new song on the piano. It was one of my favorites and he learned it!! It was Only Hope from A Walk to Remember. So cute my brothers are. I really did miss them a lot. Lord, thank you for a fantastic day. Thank you for kisses from the king, the little blessings you give to us each and every day. Thank you for family, friends, and most importantly your love. I love you so much!!!
