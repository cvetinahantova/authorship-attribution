I'm generally not very aware of the environment when walking to school, but even someone as distracted as me gets to see quite a lot of the local wildlife. There's the  urlLink American Crow, American Goldfinch, and American Robin  - all of them pretty common sights on my ways. The Canadian Goose of course is a regular. Many more are just out there on plain sight. The only problem is that they tend to not be still, and by the time I dig out my camera and wait until it powers up they're usually gone. Even when I get enough time to take a picture it ends out being quite crappy, since the camera doesn't have optical zoom.
