What is it about warm weather that turns hetero men into brain damaged "an anvil just fell on me" victims? Very weird. It doesn't even matter if the women are amply clothed, in layers..if the sun is shining and it's May or later there are women all over the city fighting men off with sticks.  Interestingly enough,  urlLink Slash 's Identical Twin asked me out on the subway today. He was hairy, tattooed, not wearing a shirt underneath his leather vest, very afroed, wearing a weird hat and ripped jeans with magic marker drawings all over them, holding a cigarette, and had black teeth. His approach was to get up and stare at my face, then ask me what I was doing for the day. It was hard not to laugh. Ordinarily I'd feel a twinge of guilt about that, but he was awfully persistent..must've asked me five times if I wanted to go out and have a drink with him.     I should've asked what kinda goofballs he was hepped up on. As he was trying to step off the train he crashed into the doors before they opened.
