For being a large, multibillion-dollar network, CBS seems to have made quite a few mistakes lately.   Number Ones ,  urlLink a prime-time collection of Michael Jackson's , was scheduled to run in November, but got rescheduled after his child molestation case broke.   Oops .  Then CBS executives gave the greenlight to a Ronald Reagan bio piece (that it now calls "fictitious") until enough people shouted for its removal and  urlLink CBS backstepped .   Oops .  And who could forget the  urlLink costume malfunction of all costume malfunctions  during the Superbowl Halftime show.    Major oops  .  If a man has an affair with his wife, he can say that he is sorry; but trust is lost.  If it happens again, more trust is lost and the apology seems less genuine.  Three times?  Any ladies sticking around for strike four?    Sorry CBS - I think its over between you and me.
