if i ever happen to tell you this exists, and you read this, please know that i am really sorry about this whole physical aspect of our friendship getting out of control.  but, i also hope that you realize it’s not all my fault.  you were the initiator most of the time…not to mention that you were the one that kept insisting that there was nothing wrong with what we were doing.  so i don’t know why you’re taking it out on me, but regardless, i'm sorry.  moving on for good now, i slept so well last night.  i woke up with this incredible sense of peace.  i could definitely get into feeling this more often.  i'm really glad i got out of the house last night.  thanks matt!  we should definitely get together more often.
