John and I had a wonderful time in North Dakota.  It was great to get to know his parents better.  They are really neat people.  One of the highlights of the trip for me was going to North Dakota's famous musical in Medora.  Medora is this cute little town, close to the ND and Montana border.  The musical is so professional.  We also had the Pitch Frok Fondue BBQ (steak depfried on a pitch fork - actually pretty good).  We di other site seeing, like the Kernal Custered's house, Mandan Indian tribe replica, Lewis and Clark Fort Mandan, Peace Garden (on the ND/Canadian border).  The drive to and from ND was long and boring at times, although there was some amaxing scenory.  I think we plan to fly next time!  John's back down in Eugene for work.  I was around him constantly for two weeks, so its a little weired to have him gone for two days.  I think I'll go for a walk and get my allergy shots today.  J
