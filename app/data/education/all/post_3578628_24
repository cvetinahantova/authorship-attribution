Paige...I got online last night and actually did some research for "WAYS TO GET RID OF A STALKER."  Here's what I found:  1.) Kill him 2.) Move 3.) Tell him your dad's got a shotgun 4.) Try going out with him...they usually will panic and     leave you alone 5.) Start stalking him 6.) Make him come over and do housework 7.) Torch his house 8.) Send him flowers from some other girl you don't like 9.) Call the police 10.) Refer to #1  Hope that helped...good luck!
