Random thoughts of the day  why does your hair do so much better when it hasn't been washed?  How do you wake up so totally, completely mad at the world?  Maybe I should ask my son, since he does it so often.  Acne does not stop when  you are an adult.  I actually like Blues Clues.  I can't stand Barney.  Listening to my Mellow mix, daniel Beddingfield's "if you're not the one" is playing right now.  The Eagles are THE best group/band EVER.  Matthew McConaughey kills me with that slow Texas drawl.  shivers, tons of shivers.  Selma Hayek does the same thing for dear sweet hubby.  Any woman over the age of 16 does so for my oldest son.    glad the other boys don't react like that, yet.  my bedroom looks so empty without the matress in it.  Makes cleaning it so much easier.  I'm rambling now.
