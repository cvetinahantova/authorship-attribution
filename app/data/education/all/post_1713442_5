I found a great site that would give newbies an opportunity to edit at a volunteer web directory.  It is  urlLink Joeant .  It is fairly easy to use and the community is friendly.  I believe that learning about "how" the Web works is good for college students so I will be incorporating info about volunteer directories in my freshmen library skills course this fall.  I will be assigning a Joeant assignment.  As Zeal and the ODP are a little too much for novices, I think Joeant will work fine.
