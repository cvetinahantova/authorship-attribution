As each chapter closes they say another one opens.  Well let's hope so,  because today it is my final youth group at church before I leave.  It is rather a sad time, not just because I will miss all the young  people (although now I will see them all at school) but because it has  been amazing to be part of the adventure of starting a new youth work  in a church that was on the brink of death.  Also as I leave, as yet there is no one to pass the baton on to,  something I am praying continually for.  I am scared about what will happen, but knowing that God has this in  his plan for me gives me comfort.  This does not stop me worrying about  this and that, no, it just gives me the peace that some how he will  provide.  I guess my prayer for church is that as the chapter that I was part of  closes, the chapter with the next person opens and starts in a massive  blaze of glory.  Let's pray so!
