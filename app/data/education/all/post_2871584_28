Well, after an eventful week that included packing, a hospital trip, more packing, a final Chorale rehearsal, sad goodbyes, and some new hellos, I am officially back in Utica.  This afternoon, Katie, Tim, and I unpacked the U-Haul amidst spitting snow.  Now it's actually sticking, and we're supposed to have four to five inches by morning.  Ahh...it's good to be home.  lol  Currently, I've made travel paths through the piles of boxes.  I can get to anywhere that I need to, and I just found my sheets, so the next task is to make my bed and fall into it.  Tomorrow is my first day of work at Pratt, so I have to get up and find the shoes I want to wear bright and early.  (Thankfully, I've already come across an outfit that will work.)  My goal is to have my entire apartment settled by next Saturday.  Considering I'm only going to be working part time, it seems like a completely attainable goal.  In the meantime, I wouldn't be surprised if I had dreams of boxes attacking me in the middle of the night.    The apartment is very different.  Size wise, it's probably about the same as what I had in Lakewood.  However, it is laid out *so* differently.  I don't have to go into a hallway to go from room to room AND I have a kitchen!  Oh, the things that excite me.  When we first started moving stuff in today, I could not figure out how I was going to get things to work out, as far as furniture arrangement went.  However, as the day has progressed, things are falling into place.  I can actually picture in my mind now how I think things will end up looking when I'm finished.  If that's how they actually turn out, it should be really nice.    That's enough babbling for now.  It's time to go clear off my bed and turn in for the night.  I'll let you know how the first day goes tomorrow!  :-)
