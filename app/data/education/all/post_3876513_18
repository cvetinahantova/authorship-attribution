"Teach me, Lord Jesus, to live simply and love purely, like a child, and to know that you are unchanged in Your attitudes and actions toward me. Give me not to hungering for the 'strange, rare, and peculiar' when the common, ordinary, and regular--rightly taken--will suffice to feed and satisfy the soul. Bring struggle when I need it; take away ease at your pleasure. "
