Living in a bustling city,we have alternative but to face stress. It might originate from a large amount of work,low self-esteem,or even busy traffic. Since avoiding a problem will not resolve it,trying to figure out some ways to defeat it would be he better choice. When you're frustrated with your work,take a break and do something to cheer yourself up. You might sing a lovely song,have a cup of coffee or write down an account of what is bothering you. When you have no confidence,forget about it and think about what you can do. Try accentuating the positive. When you're whining about cars whistling by and traffic jams,stop,and whish the drivers a safe journey. In the long run,try to lead a relaxing life and ignore what is irritating you.
