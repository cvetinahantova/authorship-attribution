especially me.  I went to buy groceries tonight, cheerful before I left.  Came home, empty handed and depressed.  What happened, long long long story.  I dont' care to repeat it.  NOW, I am still down.  I cna't seem to get over it.    Tomorrow is Noah's birthday.  He will be 6.  My baby, my youngest, will be 6.    Six is a big age.  They are no longer toddlers, preschoolers, kindergarteners, they are offically big boys.  I don't like it.  Not one bit.    My baby will be 6 when he wakes up tomorrow.  Something is very wrong with this picture.   I am never supposed to have a baby who is no longer a baby.  I had to shop in the younger boys deptartment for him today.  He is small for his age and can just now fit into a 4 regular instead of a 4T.    Too much is changing way too fast.  I know I have had 6 years to adjust to him being my last (actually 4 but who is counting.) But it still just doesn't feel right.
