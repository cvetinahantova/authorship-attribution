I know I exist. I'm not sure what else does but I chose to believe that there is 'not me' that exists separately from me. I know that the physical me is controlled by the non physical me. I know that without eternal existence, there is ultimately no point to anything I do (I'm not quite sure about this though), Although I find this hard to explain. Now I need to know what is valuable or important, so I can focus my efforts on that. I think the answer is my well being. That is what I want. That is the most important thing. As explained above, I have nothing else to go on really. So what is in my best interests? Well I want to be happy, I don't know why, or if I can even ask such a fundamental question logically, but I know I have desires and I want them met. That's the end of that.
