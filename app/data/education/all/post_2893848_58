The Cedar Rapids Kernels play at home this Sunday, July 4, at 5 pm. The big Moock and I will be there, in the lawn seating area, eating brats and drinking beer. (It's a small area -- you'll find us.) Tickets for the lawn are only $5 and can be purchased at the door. (We went last year on the 4th, and it wasn't close to being sold out.)   After the game there are fireworks, but there's some serious lag time between when the game ends and the 'works begin, unfortunately. So, bring a book, your knitting, your conversational prowess, etc.  If you haven't been to a Kernels game yet during your Iowa sojourn, this is something you absolutely must do!! The mascot is a big gray (?) kernal of corn. And if that ain't enough to get you there, what is?  Hope to see you there. We can give 2 people a ride, if there are any takers. If you need directions or info, see the  urlLink Kernels' Website .
