I just got a gmail  urlLink account !  And guess what: other members of this blog maybe eligible too... provided they are cool enough.    Just go to  urlLink www.blogger.com , sign into BAF and if you are eligible, the offer will appear on the right column.  Try it out and let me know.  I have no idea if the offer is to all bloggers, or if there is some requirement beyond basic membership (length of membership, number of posts, etc.)  Who knows.  These things are quite valuable, going for up to $60 on ebay, and  urlLink some people will do almost anything to get one .  For me, the prestige alone is worth keeping.  I so rarely get to be on the cutting edge.  If anyone would like to gmail me, email me at my old address and I'll give you the new one.  Sorry for the paranoia, but who knows where the spammers troll and I have a virgin account to watch over.
