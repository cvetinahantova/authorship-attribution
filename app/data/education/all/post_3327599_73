OMG!! it has been soo hard not to talk about Amy's party but now i can! I'm sooo glad it came together as awesomely as we had hoped! She was totally suprised and Amy it is soo awesome to see you enjoyed yourself! except the whole Jimmy Scott incident.. but like i said that's not even a Jenks number! 733-XXXX is like Okmulgee-Morris-ish. AND i looked it up and couldn't find it so either he made it up or it's unlisted! haha. i love the internet. ANYWAY i hope you like the shirts. I was trying to be creative.. You probably wont ever wear them lol but that's cool! just know that we love you and we don't want you to leave. and you better come see us! I think our senior trip will involve the 7 of us driving to Louisiana and staying at Amy's! (jk i know it's Alabama..) Make that 8.. we'll kidnap Andy and bring him too hehe! OH CRAP i forgot about that quarter.. i'll go do that as soon as i post this.. I'm a whole 25 cents richer and i'll put that towards a new paint job! because SOMEBODY i wont name names TERI AND AMY threw coins at my hood...  So last night wasn't enough for me i guess with the dude on 71st trying to kill me i had to do it again tonight.. This time it wasn't my fault! 2 ppl were chasing each other and i got in the middle of it YAY ME. I never was accused of being the bright one in the group! So anyway.. i almost rear ended him because he went from 60-0 in like 2 secs and i wasn't paying attention..
