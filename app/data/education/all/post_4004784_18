cait - that is scary news! but probably the best thing to do! i wish i could quit and go to school full time!!!! (but at this point i think its too late for me!) but congrats on havign the guts to do it!!!! how many classes will you take now?   as for those stories posted on the internet - philly already has the costume to be the jester!!!!! annnnnnd, i think they should make a no toe licking law. as u all know i am very anti feet and no toe licking is indeed the first step to a better world! in news of my own, this week is my last at camp - camps quickly ending and im happy about it even though i LOVE having my own classroom i LOVE the thought of three weeks of vacation better!  work starts again on september 8th - although i will have to start my classes again sept. 1...... ahhh well.  in other news i came home and stepped in dog shit today - not so exciting news but gross so i wanted to share. damn dogs. ok time for a nap before the girls drag me out to the bars.....feels like senior year.... love to you all!
