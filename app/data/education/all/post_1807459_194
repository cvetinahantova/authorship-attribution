So today I took a trip to the ancient city of Authaya (sp?). It's about an hour north of Bangkok and made for a very nice day trip. We look around and saw several very impressive temples. I think I'll do something similar tomorrow but this time I'll go to the Bridge on the River Kwai. I figure this is worth seeing while I'm here. I'm really tired. I think I'll get some food after this relax at a cafe have a beer and then write some postcards. I'm reading the Firm now and it's great some how I managed to leave it on the minivan. What happened is that I feel asleep and the book slid off without me noticing. Anyway I should be able to get it back tomorrow. My boss is taking forever to get back to me as usual. Ugh I wonder what would happen if LIKE was actually organized and efficiant. I'm going to make my flight plans for Saturday and hopefully that'll work out. I really love 7 eleven. They have coke slushies and hotdogs. That's just a little bit of heaven on Earth. Since I'll be here tomorrow night I might head out and hit the club. We'll see how I feel when I get back. But there seems to be a difficulty timing everything. Since my flight leaves at 7 in the morning I need to be at the airport around 5. So then if I go to the club should I even bother to get a room or should I stay out all night? The clubs close at 2 which leaves me with 2 awkward hours. Who knows. I might just hang around Khao San then. Ok I'm hungry. See you guys.
