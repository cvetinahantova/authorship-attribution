Hi all, sorry for not posting in awhile. Here is a quick update on what I've been up to:  My first week of training I ran every day. I couldn't keep this up because my shins and knees were bothering me. I took a couple days off, made sure to get good shoes, got some equipment, and now I'm back to running. I'd like to run everyday but my strict guideline is going to be not less than every other day, except if I'm injured.  I am going to be posting statistics for each of my runs on this site. I can do this because I got this great gadget that I highly recommend to anyone who plans to do a lot of running:  urlLink The Forerunner 201 . It allows me to track how far I've run, how fast I'm going, my average pace, number of calories burned, and a host of other statistics. After my run, I upload my previous run statistics to my computer, make a copy of the screen stats, and send it to the blog. Pretty simple. See below for some recent running stats. A quick note about them: They are not always accurate. The one downside of my Forerunner 201 is that it sometimes loses its GPS signal, and this can screw up the stats. For the most part they are correct, and they give me a good general picture of my progress, but there are anomolies.
