This morning I was thinking about how weird it is to come back home after being away so long.  We have been back a little more than two years and still it's surreal at times.  A friend of mine from school runs the daycare where I take my son.  An old neighbor and pal of mine is doing subcontracting work for me and is going to start working in our office as an agent.  A friend/mentor of mine picked up our friendship where it left off more than 15 years ago as if time hadn't passed at all.  It's strange, but nice.  Surreal, yet comforting.  Coming home is good.  I fretted about the fork in the road and who knows how it would have turned out had I gone the other way, but once we made the decision, the other road ceased to matter.  The possibilities seemed trite and meaningless.  (Or the shorter version of that is "who cares, anyway.")  It's so good to love where you are.
