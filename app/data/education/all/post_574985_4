New research from  urlLink The Barna Group  "examines how far adults are willing to inject the Christian faith into the nationâ€™s culture." The survey asked for opinions about six possible changes in U.S. public policy -- from removing "in God we trust" from coinage to teaching creationism in public schools -- and found that "tens of millions of Americans ... would go as far as supporting a constitutional amendment to declare Christianity the official faith of the United States."  I'm not sure what to make of that. The idea of decreeing an official faith in such a pluralistic culture bothers me, to say the least. But once again, Barna has uncovered some interesting angles about how we Americans practice and think -- or don't think -- about our faith.  Link via  urlLink YouthSpecialties .
