The 9/11 commission is like a publicized show of how bad we as Americans are at picking up on the easiest of things.  If only we had a team day in day out that was being paid to go through documents and make phone calls and hold personal interviews, then we'd be able to know ahead of time if disasters could happen.  Wait...we have  two  teams...the FBI and the CIA.  But they weren't working and so now we have the Commission.  Bush just gave out 15 million so we could all as Americans, piss our pants at night as we find out things that we thought were true were in fact wrong.  The attacks...   Umm they weren't connected to Iraq. Umm terrorists got money from U.S. Umm air traffic defense not safe.  Umm our intelligence gathering sucks.  Umm our president is incompetant and must have Cheney with him to answer questions on attacks.    It's probably a good thing an election is coming up. I will follow up with a solution.
