Always being one on the forefront of technology (evidence: home PC is a blisteringly fast Pentium 233MHz  with MMX technology , and PDA is a PalmPilot from when they were made by USRobotics), I've started this little blog.  Why, I don't know.  Maybe I am yet another sad, lonely geek desperately in need of attention.  Maybe I think this is a way to find geek-chicks.  Maybe I just can't be bothered to go to the vending machine for an awful cup of coffee and this is the latter-day alternative to a conversation around the water cooler.  Whatever.  Let's see what happens.  My money is that this will be the only post I ever do and in a month I'll just delete the thing and free up some otherwise valuable electrons.
