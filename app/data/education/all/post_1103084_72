1. did you read yesterday's blog?  read it before proceeding.  2. water is by far my favorite element.  i'm sure David will make fun of me for saying so...but I *am* a pisces & those underwater scenes in _Rushmore_, _The Graduate_ & _BottleRocket (& on...) move me.  I *get* it.  I do feel ancient longings for Atlantis....  3. This morning.  After I got out of the shower (5 a.m.) -- I hear someone splashing around in a tub downstairs.  Only there is no tub downstairs.    Water is pouring through the ceiling.  Through every light fixture (and there are a bunch of them).  I fill two buckets by wringing towels into the buckets.  The water touching my skin keeps me from feeling distressed or stressed.  I'm grateful that Lynn is sleeping still, as a Capricorn water has NO ability to calm her.    4. As I made coffee this morning at the office (something I do every morning), water splashed everywhere.  The counter, the burner, the sink even the carpet.   Water is pouring out of my life.  CLEARLY a portent of something to come?  Any predictors?  soothsayers among you?
