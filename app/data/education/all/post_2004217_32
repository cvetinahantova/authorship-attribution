*sigh*  That feeling has returned. That "Oh-shit-it's-Christmas-again-and-I-just-can't-be-arsed" feeling. The Christmas music, the "Perfect gift for Christmas" adverts, the generally shitty Christmas weather. Work didn't make matters much better either; after smashing a Â£4.99 bottle of red wine over the shop floor by nerves went to jelly and I spent the rest of the night dropping boxes of everything from biscuits to Christmas bloody puddings. And who buys Christmas puddings in the middle of November anyway?? Honestly.  In addition to my Christmas anti-spirit, the general dark cloud that seems to be hanging over school and my love life have made today one big grey blot on my self-centred teenage horizon.   In true geekish fashion, the highlight of my day was my English lesson; although I seem to be the only person EVER to be interested in creoles/code switching/accent and dialect. Oh well. It means I can answer all the questions and look even more enthusiastic than I already am, hee hee...  Ceff x   Gotta have faith...
