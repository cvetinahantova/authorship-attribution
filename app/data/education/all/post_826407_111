I think I've been enjoying traffic jams a bit too much recently, I like to sit in them and watch the people in the car behind me through the mirror.  They're always doing such cool, normal, human things, like singing to an unkown song, or laughing at a joke or lighting a cigarette.  Fascinating.  It occured to me on the way home that this might be an odd thing to enjoy, like I'm spying into lots of private worlds, I hope not.  I hope everyone does it.  Am I a scary freak or is it ok?  Please let me know.
