This has been a busy period of time for everyone.  I mean besides the daily work load, there is a move involved from the current living place to a new one, thankfully only a few blocks down the road.  Basically, the out-going place is a mess right now and here are some quick images I took this morning.  I expect things to get even worse in a few days time.  Image of the  urlLink empty bookshelves in my office , and two images from a packed with boxes living/dining room  urlLink (1)  and  urlLink (2) .  For those interested, all pictures were taken with an S55 Siemens mob phone and the attached camera at 640x480.  No further processing was involved.  More pictures later on.  Ioannis, 20040728174500
