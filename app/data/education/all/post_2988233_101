one note about the Apprentice.  I loved it!!!!! I am so glad that BIll and Quami are going at it for the apprenticeship.  I really wanted Troy to win, but I am sooooo glad that NIck and Amy are out of it.  But I have to say that tonight, Omarosa really proved what a snake she is.  If quami loooses, it will be her fault for lying to him about the phone call.
