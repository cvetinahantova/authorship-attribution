You'd never know Phoneix is French and I suspect they don't care! I first got interested in them with  urlLink "Too Young"  an 80's sounding pop song used briefly in "Lost In Translation." Now they have a new CD called   urlLink Alphabetical    (out here on 7/27)which I do not yet own. Take a look at the Roman Coppola-directed video for their new song  urlLink "Everything Is Everything"  - the band is more clever aurally than visually, that is for sure. I'll review the CD when I get it, really I will.
