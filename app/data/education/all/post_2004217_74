Today was a good day. Besides the fact that German orals are approaching at a speed faster than the time it took Elena to go from the English room to Claire Masters and bitch about me, I've had a quite smiley day. I spent the lunchtime with Helen because the gang (sans Scooby, unfortunately) went for pizza, one of those things I can no longer enjoy doing. It made a really nice change; I don't get to talk to Helen all that often and we had a laugh and listened to *K*. I've discovered its beauty (again). Mmmm.  I've made a decision!  It is not important for me to take a date to the leavers ball.  It is not necessary for me to go looking for someone to take with me just so that I won't look like a loner. The leavers' ball is exactly what it says on the tin: a ball for the school leavers. Not a ball for school leavers and their boyfriends, not a ball for school leavers and who they managed to drag with them in case they looked like they couldn't get themselves a man. So if I get a date, I do, and if I don't, then... I'm with Becky!  There are two people on the car park wearing shell suits. Intriguing.  Word of the week:  Whoopah!  Don't ask me why, but I just keep saying it.   DAY COUNT  Results Day: 9 JYF: 10 Hundred Reasons: 13 Maroon 5: 14  Ceff x   Are you safe to leave behind every anchor in your mind?
