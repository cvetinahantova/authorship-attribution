Words cannot describe the extreame hatred I have for my grandmother some times.  Tonight she comes in and insists on making fun of me, calling me stupid because I cannot understand people on the television.  I have a hearing problem.  I have always had a hearing problem (ever since my brothers had great fun shooting cap guns in my ears as a child.)  Yet that somehow makes me stupid, despite my education. She's got this insane idea that I am going to chuck all the work I've put into my credential and my masters so I can fullfill HER dream going to law school!  Nevermind the fact that I hate lawyers (of any kind) and everything they stand for. I have never gotten so angry that I threw things, or wanted to break something.  Yet tonight I swear I could've killed her.
