gosh, everything is happening so fast i can't figure out what i should be feeling. maybe, everything is at its right pace but i'm way too overwhelmed that my mind has reached point of constant lapses. or maybe...i'm just so in love....i think...  i can't believe what jammi and i have been talking about. i have never been so tensed and relaxed at the same time when talking about the stuff we talk about. but sometimes, i winder if he's just tricking me. maybe he was just nice at first so gullible me would trust him and we could talk about those stuff. but sometimes i'm so sure that maybe he's really serious or he's approaching this really cautiously.   i'm having fun in this "relationship". i get the respect i need and i think i am making him happy somehow. we're taking things nice and slow, which is a good thing for since it was so fast with JP that i never experienced those long thrilling periods others go through. i feel so regretful of JP. if i didn't get involved with him then Jammi could've been my first guy friend, first love....first kiss...first boyfriend....  yesterday was a day of shocking revelations. i found out a lot about him. some were disappointing, some were funny. all the same, he was understanding of my revelations. i confessed to him about JP and he took it well just as well as i took his confession. i told him about my situation. i had no complete freedom. we even got to the point of talking about "what if" my parents need to meet his, or my folks may get the impression he's courting me. gosh, i was so giddy.......  his dream was the coolest part..................hehehe...giddy again......
