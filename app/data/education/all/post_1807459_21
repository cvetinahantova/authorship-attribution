Well it is almost time for me to ship off.  It will take me about 24 hours to actually get to Deagu which is a pretty scary thought.  I have acquired most the items I've been asked ot bring back.  In my possession now are a bag of peanut butter M&M's, a bottle of Jager, a universal remote control that should work with most Toshiba models made after 1990 and a few gifts for some students.  Sorry Caleb no dark cherry jello around here for some reason or other.  What sucks is that I have to leave here around 5 in the morning.  I need to get something to help me sleep on the plane.  For some reason sleeping on planes is just not my strong point.  But on the other hand I'll be so messed up when I get to Korea it should be not problem fitting right in with the time change.
