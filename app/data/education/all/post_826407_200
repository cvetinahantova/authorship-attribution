School is so nearly out - No more teaching this year.  I've just got 2 more days of packing up and moving boxes etc. as the school gets ready to move into our shiny new premises.  I'm going to be going part time at school next year so that I can huddle lead in  urlLink Form  - well exciting!  We did it when it was Tribal Training a few couple of years back and H has been Huddle leading this year.  I reckon it is one of the best forums for working out what it means to be called to mission in the emerging church.  As an added bonus, my school have been amazingly accommodating about it and have given me a lot of grace.     One of the things this will mean is that H and I are going to stop looking to buy a house for now.  We could have barely afforded to buy this year so going part time means its really out of the question.  We both got kinda mixed feelings about this but think that what we're doing is the right thing.
