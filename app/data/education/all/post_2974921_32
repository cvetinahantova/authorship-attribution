how come poeple never question what is common? in a deeper sense that is. like life, why don't people question that? maybe it's because we've given up on trying to unlock its mysteries that we just decided to engage ourselves in trying to figure out stuff that could be calculated. let's face it, it's in our nature to stick to what's convenient instead of trying to think about deep and, as we assume, useless things. but if we never question life then obviously we don't know an answer to it, like what's its definition. that's kinda like knowing nothing about our own existance. isn't it a waste of time when we spend our lifetime serving the purpose we think is obligated to us. what if that purpose isn't reall our purpose? i mean, how would we know if we don't even know our reason of existance and life in the first place? how did we come to understand everything else when we find something so basic and common as life so hard to explain?
