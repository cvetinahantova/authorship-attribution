When I was growing up one thing I truely loved was the time between 3 and 5 pm.  That was when me and my Mom would talk about life.  Much of who I am now can probably be traced back to those afternoon talks.  The last couple of days I have been having similar chats with a few of my coworkers. We do not talk about the job but more about personal purpose in life and the ongoing development that happens from ages 30-40. Do you have people you can talk to like this?  If you don't try and find some, ask people questions about what they think and listen to what they say, as opposed to being focused on what you are going to say.  I know there is no humor here today and that is not because I don't feel funny, it is only because that is what is on my mind today.  How well do you know the people you know, how often do you talk about things that require deep thinking? In no way am I saying that you should be this way all the time, I am just saying that sometimes I fella has got to do some thinking and talking.
