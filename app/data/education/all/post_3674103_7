a couple weeks ago, as i was trying to publish a post, i went to view my blog, and it wouldn't load. i tried to view my sister's blog and her's wouldn't load either. i figured that there must be something wrong with blogger and that's why the pages weren't loading. i also figured that there wasn't anything i could do, so i just waited.  today, i happen to find out some interesting news. it has recently come to my attention that the south korean government has blocked access to a few certain blog sites (this one included of course). their reason: some people had posted videos of the south korean that was beheaded in iraq. therefore, the entire blog site must be censored. for how long? i have no idea.  i haven't been posting that much since i was under the impression that no one could read my posts anyway. however, now that i know the truth, i'll continue to post even though i can't view them. i might as well try and fight the fascist regime from within.
