I am back from my vacation in Clearwater. I had a great time! I was able to spend a lot of time with my family and see friends that I had not seen in a long time. I tired to upload some pictures on my weblog but the quality looked really bad. I have never had a problem adding pictures with the Hello software but for some reason it was not uploading the pictures correctly. So you can click   urlLink  here    to see some of the pictures from Clearwater. I still have to develop pictures from the underwater camera...those should be really cute. I have also added a few more pictures from my beach trip with Nikki. Click   urlLink  here    to view those pictures.   Now it's back to grad school work. I have only 22 days left of summer vacation - ahhh! I plan to have  most  of my portfolio completed so I don't have to work on it at the beginning of the new school year. I will be finished with grad school on August 31st! I should have approval on my portfolio by the middle of September. Then it will be official - no more grad school!!!
