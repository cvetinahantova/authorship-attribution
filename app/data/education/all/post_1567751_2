No one can compare to Your love Patient and kind forever Dwelling in You brings endless mirth No other love do I desire  I do not boast in my achievements How can I be proud   When You are the one carrying me Through times of famine and drought  You rebuke me gently Never keeping record of my wrongs Your anger lasts only momentarily Your favour will be my eternal song  How can I go on delighting in evil When I know You have died for me  I will rejoice with the truth For Your truth has set me free  Seeking to protect me You made the ultimate sacrifice Bearing my sins upon the tree This selfless act Iâ€™ll always prize  My trust is in You  My hope rests in You  Your love never wavers Your love perseveres forever
