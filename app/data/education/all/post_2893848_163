poems poems by scott  let me tell you something about poems. poems came from the trojan war. men killing and burning and raping each other while coyotes spit out the dust from what was left over. constantly the smell of shit. big wooden wheels rolling through shrubs. bruises and leaking arrowhead gashes.  so imagine my surprise when i saw an ad for the new brad pitt vehicle, Troy, with pitt as mr. greece, achilles, in what i predict to be a very trojan summer. depp last summer led a pirate craze, we want to be pirates, they shouted, and although i can't understand why, i know it can happen again. troy holds that same interior appeal. pirates are assholes, i'm hoping that greeks & trojans can become the new pirates. poets can be the new pirates.   i mentioned this to the hostess at a diner i often go to on my lunch break. do you think greeks & trojans can become the new pirates?, i asked, looking at her big hoop pirate earrings. she thought that pirates are pirates, no matter if they're new ones. the hostess has unsightly huge boobs and moves her stout body like a caterpillar across the graves of oh so many poets.
