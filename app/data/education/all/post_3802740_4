This weekend was absolutely wonderful.  Although the time really passed quickly, I feel that we got a lot accomplished, including the rest and relaxation that inherently comes with the territory.  Lora and I worked on the kitchen, finishing up the joint compounding of the damaged wallboard and actually got a little bit of paint on the wall.  The problem with joint compound is that it takes 24 hours to dry so it’s almost a wait and see process.  I believe all that is left is a little bit of sanding then the painting process can continue.     I really look forward to seeing the completed project.  To be quite honest, I didn’t want to take on the task, just out of sheer laziness, but my wife has really made me excited about the end product.  Other than that, my dad and I did some work out in the yard.  I think he must have been really bored, as he volunteered to help out in the yard while we were working in the kitchen.
