GRESHAM, Ore. (AP) - An Oregon City doctor will spend two months in jail after he advised a patient that having sex with him would help her pelvic pain, then billed the Oregon Health Plan for his time during their sessions.   Dr. Randall J. Smith, 50, must also perform 200 hours of community service and pay $1,105 in fines as part of a plea agreement, Rodney Hopkinson, a senior assistant attorney general for the Oregon Department of Justice, told The Oregonian newspaper.   Hopkinson said Randall, who worked as an osteopath at the Adventist Health Clinic-Rockwood in Gresham, also was sentenced to 18 months probation by Multnomah County Circuit Judge Julie Frantz on Monday.   Randall voluntarily surrendered his medical license to the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners on March 4, officials said.    Hopkinson said the woman told officials that Smith told her massaging her ``trigger points'' would alleviate her pain. Eventually, he said, the therapy involved sexual intercourse.    Smith told prosecutors that the sex was consensual, Hopkinson said.    Adventist Health fired Smith and reimbursed the Oregon Health Plan about $5,000 to cover the cost of the claims, according to spokesman Monty Knittel.
