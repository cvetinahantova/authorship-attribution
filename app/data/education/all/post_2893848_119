Rogues, Rebels, Rubber Stamps   WBEZ's Eight Forty Eight provides the " urlLink essential book list for anyone who wants to understand Chicago ," (Via  urlLink Bookslut ).  I've only read a few of these, but I know a lot of my readers live in Chicago and assumed it would be of interest to them.  It makes me wonder: what does "place" mean, anyway?  How is it that we are we able to agree that Chicago is culturally peculiar and distinct from other cities of comparable size?  It seems that, despite the identifiable "feel" of any city, the similiarities between cities would outnumber the differences. (Meaning that Chicago is more like New York than it is like Libertyville or Kankakee). And what about the implications of "place" for fiction writing?  How does a writer successfully characterize a place without reducing it to cliches and overstated exoticisms?  Without making a caricature of it?
