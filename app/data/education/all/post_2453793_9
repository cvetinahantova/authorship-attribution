ah, break is finally here.  i'm ecstatic.  i think i'm heading home tomorrow...or sunday.  i haven't decided for sure yet.  part of me really wants to leave tomorrow because 1) i'll be getting away from here sooner, 2) i'll get to see my family and puppies sooner, and 3) i won't have to drive far on sunday because i'll already be home.  however, part of me just wants to stick around here a little bit longer so i can 1) clean my room, 2) play jak & daxter, 3) try to make amends with the boys, 4) not have to drive a long way tomorrow and 5) put off going home and being put to work on cleaning the house.   ugh...i have so much to do.  i desperately need to start doing my christmas cards.  i should bring some of my games home so i can play with my sisters.  i really feel like playing dominos or monopoly right now.  oh, i went to see return of the king tonight.  it was great.  of course there were quite a few cutouts from the book...and a good portion of the movie was from the two towers book.  but nonetheless, it will be a classic.  i'm excited to act out parts of the fellowship & the two towers with my sisters when i go home.  i really miss having them around...i'm certainly not as happy without them here.  krista is hilarious and kelly is just weird.  i actually sort of feel like myself around them.   oh, it will be good to see them.  it will also be fun to housesit/petsit for a few days.  remind me i have to buy ski pants and a pair of mittens wouldn't hurt either.
