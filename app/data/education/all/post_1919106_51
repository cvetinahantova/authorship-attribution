Slow days, good movies   I got up late in the morning, and found out that I had a terribly sore throat. Apparently the cold had been productive that night. I decided to destroy it's work with a nice hot cup of milk with honey... That last chug of liquid honey really put the energy back into me, and my throat has felt smooth like silk since then.  Just like Saturday, I spent all morning chatting online with friends (yes, Amber was among them too.) There was a link to this one site on Ars Technica about this group that put 11-13 year olds to play Atari games (such as Tetris and Pong) and the comments they made made me feel really old. I had a meeting with the project group for English Literature at 2, so I headed over to the library. We (they) decided to work on Mary Wollstonecraft for the project. I don't really care, as long as I get that done. On the way back I stopped at Amber and Carol's place to get some company, because I didn't feel like sitting alone at home. Chesney was there too, and they were watching  Spinal Tap , but decided to watch something else as I got there. We first watched  High Spirits , which was fun and reminded me of this other movie, whatchamacallit...  Haunted Honeymoon ? Anyway, after that one Chesney left and we watched  Boondock Saints , which absolutely rocked. I loved the cat splat scene, it was fucking hilarious. By the time we finished that one it was almost 7 pm, and Carol hadn't arrived yet, so we started getting a wee bit worried. She arrived 1/2 hour later (we were watching  Brotherhood of the Wolf  by then) and it turns out that she had just left home late. Well, that was one less thing to worry about. Anyway, Amber and Carol went over to Rebecca's to practice, and I went home and made myself some good soup to knock out the cold. You know it's good soup when your sinuses dissolve like butter in a hot pan while eating that soup.
