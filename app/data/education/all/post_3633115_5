Except there is no old man snoring here.  There's too damned much water.  He can't sleep for fear of drowning.  I know that this part of Texas hasn't seen this much rain during this season in a long freaking time.  The weird thing is, I love the weather. I'm pretty sure that I am getting into the wrong business.  I should reconsider my major and go into meteorology or the like.  I could sit and watch clouds all day.  I thoroughly enjoy watching lightning.  I totally dig being in an airplane when it rains  urlLink (there's something on the wing!) .  I could never see myself chasing a tornado, but I know that the possiblity of being able to do so would be cool.  I stopped counting the time between thunder and lightning when I saw  urlLink Poltergeist   so many years ago. Hey, you never know.  I have no idea where I was going with this.....
