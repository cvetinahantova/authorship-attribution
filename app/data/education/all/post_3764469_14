Remember the time when we (at one time or the other), as students, used to call our teachers and profs weird names and imitate their funniest/most nauseating gestures and accents... well (see the title)...       It has finally come to bite me. Goodness.       Imagine seeing one of your students imitating your (admittedly) weird mannerism.        I thought I've actually prepared myself for this. I thought I was prepared for the fact that one of my students, will, sooner or later, imitate me the way I imitated my funniest/weirdest professor/teacher. Now, I believe being prepared is one thing, seeing it happen infront of you is another.         Is life truly a cycle you can't break?
