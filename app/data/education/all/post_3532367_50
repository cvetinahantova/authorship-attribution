So much for getting sleep last night. The dog woke me at 01:00 scratching around and howling, while Sandra accidentally woke me at 05:00 when she moved sharply in her sleep. I am the person who can sleep anywhere at anytime - even standing up! It's 08:45, I've been in work for 45 minutes and I am yawning already (and I feel hungry, as the rest of the team eat saussage and egg McMuffin's).
