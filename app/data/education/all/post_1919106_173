I'm not dead   Nope, not at all. I was just very busy these past few weeks, what with the semester finishing and the graduate research symposium coming up. Well, I'm glad to announce that pretty much most of it is over. The symposium definitively, and the classes almost.  Most of it is boring, so I'll spare everyone the task of having to read it. But I  will  give you some bullet-list updates:  * There was this one guy at the Q&A during my presentation that completely dissed my results and went on with some highly questionable ramblings, and ran (literally) out of the room once he was finished. The judges still liked my presentation despite of that, so that's ok.   * I am giving my old computer to my stepsister for her kids to play with. It barely survived the shipping anyway, so I figured that if her kid's computer is going to get messed up anyway, it better be one that has already survived all types of ordeals. I'll miss having a decent graphics card (the laptop I'm currently using has a crappy Intel one), but once I rake up enough money for my own laptop I'm getting something decent.   *Raspberry sherbet! Good stuff.   * iPod -I finally got to the point where I filled it up. I'll probably go back and re-encode my CD's to a lower bitrate (960192 vbr is quite large).   * Camera -I finally borrowed a decent digital one, so I'll be taking pictures here and there in the next few days and will maybe post them here.
