With Sandra being at work and having no kids because they stopped at their Nan's last night (because we went out) I had an afternoon to myself. Following on from the cleaning, washing-up, polishing and a spot of gardening, I decided to give Angela a ring.     Her kids were back home after their holiday, but she didn't mind, although I would have to bring my steps over to help chop down the hedge. Well this bloody hedge comprised of at least 16, 20 ft high conifers. And my steps were 6 ft. So that settled it, the new hedge was going to be 10 ft by the time I finished. Nearly 3 hours later, I was only half way though. As the electric trimmer was only capable of shaping the edges, I had to manually saw through the rest.     It still needs finishing off, but Angela decided I needed to be finished off before I left too, so she dragged me upstairs and locked me in the bedroom  - thank God for Stuart Little - LOL
