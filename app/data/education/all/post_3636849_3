A trend exists in our society; people identifying happiness through others.  I've watched couples exchange vows within the absence of love.  Some are so desperate to not be alone, they would marry a mule deer with one antler.  I question the health of doing so.  Why should you enter a relationship with someone because they are acceptable?  Shouldn't you hold out for someone who jars the senses, or someone who makes your mouth go dry the minute they enter your space?  I've heard scores of stories about sordid affairs and one-night stands (which seems to be a norm in college life), but I fail to recognize one truly happy individual with such tales.  I don't mean to dismiss the trial-like nature of being single at this stage of life; i haven't been in a serious relationship since my freshman year, and at times I probably would've succumbed to a one-off tryst had the opportunity been given.    We have so little time, so why waste it on something that won't accrue value?    Until I find what I'm looking for, I'll be happy making pickles and watching "The West Wing".
