If you see me walking down the street Staring at the sky And dragging my two feet You just pass me by It still makes me cry But you can make me whole again  And If you see me with another man I'm Laughin and I'm jokin' Tryin to get by I Won't put you down Cuz i want you around You can make me whole again  Looking back on when we first met I can not escape and i can not forget Baby you're the one you can do no wrong You can make me whole again  Time is layin' heavy on my heart Seems I've got too much of it Since we've been apart My friends make me smile If only for while You can make me whole again  Lookin' back on when we first met I can not escape and I can not forget Baby you're the one you can do no wrong You can make me whole again  For now I'll have to wait But baby if you change your mind Don't be too late Cause I just can't go on It's already been too long But you could make me whole again  Lookin' back on when we first met I can not escape and I can not forget Baby you're the one You can do no wrong You can make me whole again  this is for my coco schmoogers! u sing harmony man!  went swimming, saw gloria [HI GLORIA!] couldnt really swim cuase of all the little kiddies, super hot lifeguard...but thas a different story.....a little bit of hot tubbin, and we were outta there!  thats my day  thanks for tuning on  TASH IN later much  CHEERS(B)   MOFO: PICK ME UP IN URE TRUCK AND WE'LL HAVE A HONKIN' GOOD TIME BABY!!!
