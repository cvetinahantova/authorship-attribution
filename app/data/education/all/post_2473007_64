A new leaf or an old leaf, they are all leaves; and as leaves in their due time they will curl at the edges and fall into great piles that will in turn give themselves over to the dust and the only memory of their existence will be the dark earthy scent that lingers on their autumn air.  But oh the thrill of their blossom, the shade of their fullness and the sad beauty of their passing!
