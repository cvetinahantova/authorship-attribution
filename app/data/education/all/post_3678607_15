It has been a few weeks since I have written in this thing, I have been, once again, prompted by my own conscience to write.  My favorite writer for the  Bakersfield Californian   has a blog on this website  urlLink www.daniellebelton.blogspot.com . I love her. I really do. She's a great writer with an apparent love of Prince. She is a very interesting writer. She has this column called WOTS ( W ord  O n  T he  S treet) and doesn't have her name on it as to leave the impression that it is anonymous. It's not, anyone who reads the  Eye Street  (the Californians entertainment section) will know it is her. Oy. I used to be an aspirering journalist. My dreams were dashed when, after one year of journalism my Sophomore year of HS,  I chose Wind Ensemble over it. I was pretty good at it too. I was going to apply for an internship at the Californian but didn't. Anyway...   I have a new favorite place.  Jamba Juice.  Pretty much the best smoothies short of my own.  I have been drinking them a lot lately. I think that the best flavor is  "Strawberry Tsunami". Yummy! I think everyone should experience Jamba Juice. There has never been a better way to consume calories.
