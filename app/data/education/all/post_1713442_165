urlLink Learning About Books & Libraries   This is a good book for teaching elementary aged students information literacy skills.  I had a look at it and liked it a lot.    Review of book from  School Library Journal :  "This practical resource for media specialists, classroom teachers, and homeschoolers assists in introducing students to the worlds of children's literature and research. The text is divided into three main categories of games. Those related to fiction include guessing and creating book clues, title charades, and a book-character scramble that is similar to Scrabble. The second category of nonfiction activities introduces subjects such as the Dewey System, bibliographies, keyboard skills, and genres. Lastly, games related to specific stories, such as "Three Billy Goats Gruff" and Helen Lester's Hooway for Wodney Wat, are offered. Each idea is accompanied by a suggested range of grade levels from kindergarten through sixth grade. A useful index/grid reiterates this information along with the skill taught for each game. An excellent, well-planned, and thorough book."  Review by Joyce Rice, Limestone Creek Elementary School, Jupiter, FL
