(above = guster lyrics)... actually, i shoulda said that yesterday.... yesterday was good... today, not bad, but whatever... had class, had lunch, worked on homework and made progress but didn't completely solve anything with sarah, leigh, and colleen, and now i'm home  partway through working, we noticed 2 hornets in the room, and called eric and had him dispose of them (not kill -- just politely throw them out the window), for which he laughed at us, but did anyhow.  otherwise, work, work, work... it would be nice if i could solve at least something!  oh, and i heard "gettin jiggy with it" (will smith) on the radio on the way home for the first time in ages... is it sad that i know most all the words?  why does my brain hook onto words to dumb songs, but not onto worthwhile math equations?  dude...  friends and apprentice tonight -- 2 of my holy trio of can't miss tv shows... party indeed.  later dudes.
