As I go on writing my position paper, I find out that there are many quotations to deal with...I think it is tempting to insert many long quotations in my paper and use my own words only for connecting passages.I do this because I feel the author of my sources are better writers than I am.But, I do not quote excessively... long series of quotation gives the impression that I cannot think for myself.I use direct quotations only when the sources is particularly clear or expressive.One thing for sure... most all of the time I used my own words to summarize and paraphrase my sources and to explain my ideas....Actually I  am still not satisfied with my position paper...
