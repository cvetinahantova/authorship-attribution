Savannah is doing much much better, she will be home sometime today.  Her ammonia level was down to 59 I think Renee said, I am awful at remembering numbers.    Eric, the boys with the surveyors stake in his eye, is doing good.  He should have his second surgery in two weeks.    I am having a good morning.  Kind of.  I was going to go shower, but havne't any clean clothes to put on, so I am having to wait on laundry.   Our washer quit a couple of months ago, so we have to go to my parents house to wash clothes.  Which is fine, they live aobut 250 feet away.  So it isn't hard.  Just the fact that I forgot to do MY laundry this week.  Sheesh.
