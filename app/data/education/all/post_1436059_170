Gahhh...  The carpeters are ripping up our old carpet, and they think they spakeled Charlotte into the air pipes...Shelby says we may never see the little kitty again...*sobs*  Tomorrow I'm staying after all afternoon since the meet doesn't start till 6 and I don't have to be there till 5 and my parents can't give me a ride there after school. So after Bio I'm leaving and walking down Patriot Lane to go to McDonalds or 711 to hang out w/ jenn and whoever else wants to go.  Talent show auditions are on Friday. 3:40. Ehhh no big. Amanda's nervous about it though, I think, and Caitlyn hasn't even finished her dance yet.
