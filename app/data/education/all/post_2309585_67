A GAME-BOY:  You're like a tomboy without the love of sports. Reality sucks, but as long as you have your electronics you feel you can cope. Time goes unnoticed when you're locked in your room hooked up to your Nintendo, rocking to your favourite collection of guitar-driven albums.  Your virtues:  Intelligence, sense-of-humour, individuality.  Your flaws:  Inability to cope with real life, action-freak spirit, reclusive nature.   urlLink   What kind of girl are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Had my first day of Child and Adolescent Devlopment today. So far, not too bad, and the teacher seems to like me (mainly because of my willingness to discuss the material).  Found out through the updated catalog today that I may have to take a TON of other classes in order to certify. This may take longer than I thought. Not good. I can't afford it.
