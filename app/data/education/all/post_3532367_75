Thank you God for Mia, she is going through shit and is still there for me. We have been chatting on MSN all day, with friendly chat, flirtation, vulgarity, blantant sexual comments and care. I have a thumping head (half from all the typing and half from the annoying call with the counsellor), yet still she is there, offering advice and suggestions.
