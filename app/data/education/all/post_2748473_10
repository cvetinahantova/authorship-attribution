it takes more time than i've ever had drains the life from me makes me want to forget as young as i was, i felt older back then more disciplined, stronger and certain but i was scared to death of eternity i was saved by grace but destroyed by naivety and i lied to myself and said it was for the best so now faith is replaced with a logic so cold i've disregarded what i was now that i'm older and i know much more than i did back then but the more i learn the more i can't understand and i've become content with this life that i lead where i drink to much and don't believe in much of anything and i lie to myself and say "it's for the best." we're moving forward, but holding ourselves back and we're waiting on something that will never come
