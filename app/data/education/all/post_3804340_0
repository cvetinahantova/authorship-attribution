My friend and I watched a Korean movie  urlLink 'Tae Guk Gi'  yesterday. The story was so so. It's so impressive to me when I think again what is war. If war is a mean towards a goal. I am sure the goal mustn't be something good. What kind of goal is it to make people die for it??? I am not talking about one or two people, I am talking about one or two or even more millions of people. War or the same race is pathetic. We speak the same language and we are of the same race. Kinship? Brotherhood? Family? I don't know which word is appropriate to describe the linkage. No matter what, we share something. Is it necessary for the laymen to die for certain believes?        I sincerely do hope China and Taiwan will never have to declare war.
