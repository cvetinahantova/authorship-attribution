Just read an email from Angela. She wrote it last night, but it is very painful to read. She still wants us to be just friends, but nothing more. I suppose it's down to all the baggage I have. To be honest who can really blame her? - a single free happy life with the only problems being your own or taking on me.... and a "married at the moment" me as well.  As if I haven't lumbered her with enough, without her being dragged through someone elses divorce too.  I can't blame her, I don't blame her and if I am truthful I can't expect her to be there "on my terms" - how fair is that in a relationship?
