Well, today was track and fun day at school.  It was supposed to be yesterday, but we were supposed to get rain, so it was supposedly cancelled until today.  Supposedly.  Anyway, I hung out with Katie and Josh, Bethany, Brooke, Chelsea and Phil, and then me and Timmy.  The people connected with "and" are going out.  It was fun.  I became tired of writing my name and the same "have a great summer!  This year was really fun!  I can't wait to see you next year at the high school!" and then a tiny note about something that person and I did during the year.  Chels kept yelling at me to hold Timmy's hand or something...she thought he was being prude.  Half of my friends do, I think.  But hey I had fun. I ran two miles today just for the fun of it.  Okay, so I ran more like one and a quarter before I stopped to walk.  Well, I think it was more than that.  I don't know. Tommorow is the last day of school!  You know what really bugs me though?  I have an 83% in algebra...I need an 84% to be on the honor roll!  That will be the first "C" I've ever had on my report card!  Ever!  In my life!  I'm not going to tell my parents...I want to survive until tomorrow.  I'm never taking another cruise again!  Ms. Shade said we'd be reviewing...ya right!  We did like, three sections while I was gone!  Thanks a lot.
