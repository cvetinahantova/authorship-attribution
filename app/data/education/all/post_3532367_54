Another 04:00 wake up call. I just couldn't get to sleep again for over an hour, yet when the alarm when off at 06:30 I couldn't get up! Sandra says if I pester her for sex again at 4 in the morning, she will kill me. Typing this I can't say I blame her, but at the time I just can't think like that....why?  Back to work today too - should be fun!
