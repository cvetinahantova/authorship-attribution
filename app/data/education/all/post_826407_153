took some of my y10s to Manchester yesterday.  The day was a lot of fun, except for the bit where some of our girls seemed intent on picking a fight with some exchange students from France.    We went to Old Trafford first and then on to the  urlLink Imperial War Museum North .  I'm not really a sport follower (too tall and clumsy at School to ever be good enough at it to enjoy watching it), but I think going to the  urlLink Man U  ground helped me finally understand the sport/religion connection. Old Trafford is for sure a place of worship.  Thousands of seats all focused on the "hallowed turf" and Icons of Man U, players and sponsors everywhere.  I found the whole set up both awe inspiring and challenging.    The Imperial War Museum was excellent.  It seemed to me to be part museum and part memorial.  I enjoyed the building design a lot.  Where the other IW museums tend to glorify war a little this place did not.  But was intent on focusing on how it affects our individual stories.  There was an amazing presentation at the beginning of the affect of war on Children.  In an older museum this would be on a big screen at the front.  But here it was split up on a load of screens with different images and testimonies.  The presentation was projected across the whole museum so you got it going across tanks and harrier jump jets as well as bare walls.  Very moving.  The whole museum felt very -ahem- postmodern and seemed to be grappling with some of the same issues of presentation and contextualisation as the alt/emerging church.  Manchester also has  urlLink URBIS , which is another attempt to rethink museums a bit.    Who says London has all the fun?
