ONE..........MORE...........DAY!  I can hardly believe it!  I went to workout tonight and-- pathetically (sp?)-- it hurts to sit here and type.  lol.  I guess that means it was a   good   workout.  Tonight it rained so much!  Or as Stephen says, "it was a gully washer."  hehehe.  What a fun day!  The kids even scrubbed their own desks!  Less scrubbing for me to do this summer :)  Gotta get to bed.  I have a feeling morning will come early tomorrow....
