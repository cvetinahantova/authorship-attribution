Lonliness is a bitch.  Ain't she?  What is it about her?  How does she sneak up on you like a shadow?  She's a darkness that overtakes you before you even know you've blinked.  The thing I hate about lonliness is you can be completely surrounded by those who love you and still feel her presence.    I am loved.  I don't have many friends, but I am loved.  My husband absolutely adores me.  He treats me wonderfully and romances me nonstop.  I have a great friend named Vanessa.  She knows me inside and out, yet we've only known each other a year.  I get to see her every work day, which is amazing.  Not many people get to see their friends five days out of the week.  Yet today, lonliness found me.  What's worse is she wouldn't leave.  I yelled.  I screamed.  I pushed.  But she just wouldn't leave.  Why does she have to be such a bitch?
