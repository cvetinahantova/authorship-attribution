urlLink The New York Times > National > Survey Finds U.S. Agencies Engaged in 'Data Mining'  Another chapter in the national debate opens: security vs. civil liberty.  Problem is, the old laws governing privacy don't tell us that much.  Based on the principle that a man's house is his castle, common law learned to stop the government at the threshold.  But there was an epistemological concept already available: for square walls told the law exactly where to stop.  Where exactly do we stop with data mining?  a few possibilities:   1) data mining creates a fundamentally new fact out of information merely lying about.  The new information needs to be moderated.  the government keeping data is ok, the government applying search programs is not.  - argument: If I visited your orchard, stole apples, and made applesauce, the applesauce isn't mine just because i applied my labor to it.   - but: intellectual labor is different; seeing houses in the city, I am free to argue whatever I please about the nature of city life.  intellectual material is fundamentally public and can't be owned in the same way, can it?  ah, if only we had good reasons for believing in intellectual property.  but what a world of problems it would confuse to people making judgments about others based on gossip, sight, or reading too much.    2) data mining is inevitable, but what government can do with its results should be limited.    - problem: how do you limit seemingly certain knowledge?  aren't we headed for Minority Report?  aren't there fatal errors in any model? - devil's advocate: is the correct leftist response to encourage data-miners to use -better- and -richer- data, so as to designate free-speech activists apart from terrorists, and leave Nader's campaign manager alone?    philosophers, help!  What Would Locke Do?  stay tuned for the Minow report, due today...
