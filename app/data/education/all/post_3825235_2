Heh, I just realized that I never said how Friday's excursion went.  Well, we met at McD's so the kiddos could eat lunch and play together for a while, and then drove to the zoo.  Unfortunately, by the time we got there, it would only be about an hour before the zoo would close, so, after much deliberation, we decided to go to Putt-Putt instead.   It was so fun!  We did the arcade game thing, bumper boat thing and the racecar thing, and believe me, with 4 kids and 2 adults, it got  kinda  crazy.  We were getting pretty creative in trying to coordinate things.  But, I'm pretty sure everyone had a fun time.  After that, it was off to CiCi's to feed the young'uns.  (Us, too, but that's a given!)  The kiddos had fun speding their quarters and tokens both places, even though they were pretty heart-broken about not being able to go to the zoo.  We'll go again, sometime.  You'll see.
