A very sad thing happened this week, Kitty Brynn's cat died. I feel awful because just previously I was saying how annoying she was. But ever since they moved into their new house Kitty has been really good, and I have enjoyed having her around, we even had her model for us so we could draw her. I wish I could take back what I said about her but I can't, she's gone. I really did like her, I did. Just makes me think about life, like if there is anyone that I have thought bad things about or has bad things thought about me, and if that isn't resolved how awful that feels.  Brynn's grandparent's were here for a couple of weeks, it was fun. I came over but all I had to do was play with Brynn. No problem! It's cool because I really like talking to her grandma, she makes me feel like one of the family, I should say they all do, it's like having a family of my own outside of home, and it feels great to know that you are wanted and belong there.Throughout the weeks I have been able to get to know Grandma and also help Shara with some stuff that she is going through as well. It's weird how stuff that she is going through right now is stuff that I have been through already, the weird thing is that we both know that we were placed in each others lives for a reason. This was a God thing totally. I am so excited to see what's happening in that house. I have been realizing more and more lately that I really need to take time to get myself fed, I do a lot for others but really haven't taken me time. I know that I need to but between Brynn and the different stuff going on I just haven't been able to find a bible study that works. They don't have bible studies that start at 7:30ish, it's too late. I am still praying though, I might start looking into different churches bible groups. I just pray that I can find one.
