urlLink  Bush�s Radical Fiscal Immorality       You can ask Americans to spend $166 billion to get the job done in Iraq and in Afghanistan (that�s $79 billion so far, plus the president�s new request for $87 billion).   You can ask us to tolerate modest budget deficits while spending what�s needed to meet a major national challenge.   But President Bush can�t ask us for $166 billion for Iraq while he runs record $500 billion budget deficits and doubles the national debt -- all in order to give $300 billion a year in tax cuts over the next decade mostly to the best-off people in America.   And Bush certainly can�t do this when he�s also saying there�s no money for huge unmet domestic needs in health care, education and more.   No, this is the moment when President Bush�s radical fiscal irresponsibility has veered into radical fiscal immorality.
