I stood atop the roof of my school building today, the building in which I teach freedom and love, and I watched as the horizon was smudged with the thick, black smoke of terror and hatred.  The hallways echoed with tragedy and children looked out the window at nothing, perhaps visualizing a scenario, almost unthinkable to the innocent, in which the innocent die.  And while they imagined hell, it was swallowing up Manhatten not thirty miles away.   I never dreamed there would come a day when I would have to comfort a child facing the harrowing thought that mom may not be coming home.  Everyone expects the teacher to have things under control; everyone knows the teacher has all the answers.  No one ever suspects that tears are hiding just behind the corners of my eyes.   When the first plane crashed, I was shocked.  When the second plane crashed, I stood in disbelief.  After recieving word that the Pentagon had been hit, I began to be afraid.  But as I watched each tower fall in flaming ruin, my heart fell with almost as much devestation.  What shook me was the loss of stability.  The building was damaged, and what a grievous thought; but when the mighty had fallen, when the Twin Towers had disappeared forever, all sense of security and safety was stolen from me.  I became vulnerable.   Vulnerability can mean one of two things.  I can stand alone, open to attack and almost certain destruction; or I can look for an embrace in the Arms of One who can protect me.  I am afraid, and I don't want to be in the valley of the shadow of death alone.   Father, protect me.  Protect us as a nation.
