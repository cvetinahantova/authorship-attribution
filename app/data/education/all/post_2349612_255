(1) woke up before noon (2) went to church and actually had 3 other math grad students come with me! (paul, sujith, and colleen) (3) grocery shopping (this is majorly exciting because i have a weird paranoia about going to the grocery store by myself, or once there about dealing with shopping carts -- a liter of egg drop soup for $1.50 makes me happy though :-) ) (4) finished reading  the millenium problems  (as if you can't tell by the previous entry (5) talked on the phone with heather miller for an hour (6) talked on the phone with eric for an hour (7) talked on the phone with roommate for half an hour (8) talked on the phone with jenny lemahieu for half an hour (first i'd talked to her since her heart surgery 4 weeks ago) (9) had my room shown off to prospective new tenant... dude... (10) talked on the phone with tammy for an hour  [by this point, my ear hurt from being attached to the cell for 4 hours straight more or less, but they were quite the quality chats :)]  tammy quote: "i don't know what to do around girly girls because really, i'm not one, and i completely don't understand... what's up with them?"  (11) dinner: egg drop soup, some sushi, and some raw mushrooms -- doesn't that sound great? (12) finished reading "the spy issue" of mental floss (back issue from mid-2002)  what's next on the list?  more fun reading of course!  astronomy magazine, this week's issue of time, other astronomy magazine, or  the science of God ... your guess is as good as mine =P  later dudes.
