Holy Moo!!! Schools gonna start tomorrow.It should be a new term but for me it's the same old thing.I'm just so irritated that i've got to take bus 133 then 851,852 or 13 to Yio Chu Kang Secondary School.Enter through the back gate,go and assemble,look at my friends with a irritated look,sing the national anthem,listen to the announcements teachers have for the whole school,go back to class and hell begins....The only thing on my mind is "WILL ANY F***ING TERRORIST PLANT A BOMB IN MY SCH?"[impossible]..k i betta go and iron my freaking uniform or i'll have to suffer early in the morning ironing it. So good night everyone.
