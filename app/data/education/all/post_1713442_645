urlLink Youth Courts in Law-Related Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Paula A. Nessel.   From the ERIC Digest:   Youth courts, which comprise teen courts, peer juries, peer courts, student courts, and other courts wherein juveniles sentence juvenile respondents, have rapidly gained popularity. In 1991 there were over 50 youth courts in 14 states; by 2002, the number of youth courts grew to more than 850 in 46 states and the District of Columbia. This Digest discusses (1) types and functions of youth courts, (2) the relationship of youth courts to law-related education, (3) student courts in schools, (4) educational effects of youth courts, and (5) the National Youth Court Center.    TYPES AND FUNCTIONS OF YOUTH COURTS.    Youth courts involve juveniles in the sentencing of other juveniles, in either a school or a community setting. Young people usually serve as jurors and may also fill the roles of prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, judge, bailiff, or other officers of the court. Respondents usually are referred to a youth court for sentencing, not for a judgment of guilt or innocence. Many youth courts accept only first-time respondents who have committed relatively minor offenses such as theft, alcohol/drug offenses, vandalism, and disorderly conduct (Godwin 1998).   Respondents voluntarily choose youth court, with parental approval, as an alternative to an existent sentencing agency or disciplinary office. Respondents who prefer legal representation or the regular court (or disciplinary system) can decline referral to youth courts.
