I am completely regretting not going to the stupid Mid-Winter dance. Okay, so I really should shut up about this, but HE WAS LOOKING FOR ME.  THAT'S IT. He has to go to prom with me next year. And um, Homecoming, and Winter Formal/or whatever they'll call it next year. *cough* Friday, we were talking about Mid-Winter, and junk, and everyone was being all pissah, because they didn't have dates, and stuff. Right, so they were complaining about probably not having dates for prom, and I felt gulity. Meh.   Anyways, I swear, I will stop thinking/whining/writing about this. Well, hopefully. Haha. HE WAS LOOKING FOR ME. Okay, stop me from calling one of my friends, and start whining like crazy. =|!
