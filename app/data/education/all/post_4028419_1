Sometimes I felt like I was just going through the motions to keep myself afloat. I couldn't have love at the time, so I closed my eyes and pretended the one I was with was loving me--ME, not just "that part" of me. I guess it works for the 15 minutes. But after that is done, I want to feel more. I want to be ABLE to feel more. I DESERVE to feel more. But I smile and pretend that it's enough when I know that it's not. I just make it enough. But I feel so empty.  So, I called H and told him that I didn't like the way he kinda hung up on me when he found out that I wasn't coming to see him. He told me he was sorry that he made me feel bad, but that I had gotten his hopes up and he had really wanted to see me. I told him I thought it was about sex but he said it was emotional for him. That he wanted to really see me, just hang out with me-be with me. I wish I could believe him. I need to believe him. If it's true, then I will feel really good. But who knows with him. I think the thing with H is that I am too aware of his ability to play games so I want to try to peep the game before I let him play it--he could very well be sincere, but time will reveal that-as it does everything.  When I love me. When I SEE me. When I NEED me. Then, and only then, will I  truly  BE. Easier for me to say it though...
