According to the NYT, in the new Afghan constitution, "women were given recognition as equal citizens, and 25 percent of the seats of the lower house of Parliament were set aside for them."  Given that there still is no Equal Rights Amendment to the US Constitution and that women only make up about 14 percent of the UA Senate and the House of Representatives, perhaps our own loya jirga is in order, no?
