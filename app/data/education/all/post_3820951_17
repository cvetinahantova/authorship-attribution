speaking of lost friendships, this song indicates pretty much how all of us feels when we lose a best girl or guy friend...even though it's a break-up song, the thought's the same, you miss the kind of person that you were when you were still best friends...  the man i was with you - jimmy bondoc  listen just hear me out  yes i know we agreed  when we break up we'd never give in to this need  to admit to each other  i miss you   listen just hear my cry  no i won't break my word  if i do say i miss you it would never be heard  let my heart whisper  all that it needs to   *how could you make me take a start?  then just leave me here hanging  can't even say how i'm feeling  how could you make then break my heart?  if i can't say that i miss you  let me say one last thing   #i miss him  and all the things he could do  yes/oh, i miss him  just as much as i miss you  oh, i miss him  i know you're wondering who  yes, i miss him  i miss the man i was with you oh i would never be the same   listen just hear my voice  can you hear all the tears?  that i'm planning to hide  for the next thousand years  just as long as you know that  i love you   repeat *,#  except last line  how can i blind then find the light?  how can i find the kind of right?  how could you take away my sight?  how could you lose me in the night?  then you took away the heart in me  now i'm losing this fight  no i would never ever be the same   ooh.. ohh   oh, i miss him  and all the things he could do  yes, i miss him  just as much as i miss you  oh i miss him  i know by now you know who yes, i miss him  i know by now you know who  i miss him  i miss the man i was with you   oh, i would never be the same
