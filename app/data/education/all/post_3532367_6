I've made a conscious decision to avoid Sharon. I've put her number on ignore and her messenger and email on block. I've got nothing against her on a personal level, I just need to avoid creating further damage to myself and my family.  I don't really know what is worse - having sex with someone else behind Sandra's back, just for the sake of "needing" a sexual high or continuing in the same manner as we are with each other. I've chosen at the moment to remove the third party. Let's see if I can stick to it.
