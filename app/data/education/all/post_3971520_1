So, just in case you didn't already know, I am so sore!!!!! I am hurting so bad and I think I hurt myself worse today. WE learned barrell rolls today ans just let me tell ya', they are not for older gals such as myself. I was so eager to get out there and demonstrate them and didn't realize that all of the other coaches just stood back and watched. Stupid me.   I did learn some new things today. I learned how to 'get krunk' by learning the chicken head dance. Maybe some of you already know this, but I didn't. I think it is a culture thing and there is a reason that white people don't know this dance. It is because we have no rhythm and just cannot do it without looking stupid. Yes, I got laughed at today...a lot. That's ok. I can handle it. At least they know that I am eager to learn new things.   I just got home from taking the written portion of my CDL bus driver's license. There are five sections and I failed ALL of them!!!!! What is up with that? Maybe I should study before I go back to take it tomorrow. I am feeling pretty down about not being 'krunk' and not passing my test. Any loving words to make me feel better? How about a story of feeling stupid today?
