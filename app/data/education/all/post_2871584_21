Sometimes I have to wonder if going to work is relaxing, compared to some of my days off.  For example, I just finished making a list of things that I am doing tomorrow.  It is longer than any list I have on a work day!  Oh well.  At least it's stuff that I "want" to do... right?  Anyway...  This weekend, I'm heading down to NJ.  It's going to be an interesting trip.  I'm not looking forward to being in NJ at all.  However, I am looking forward to seeing some people again, and I'm looking forward to singing.  God, I miss singing.  I want to do it again so badly.  I need to find a group to join up here.  In other news... yeah.  That's about it.  Life has been frighteningly normal of late.  Nothing terribly exciting.  ::knocks on wood::  I'm sure that I'll have more to report later in the week.  Stay tuned.
