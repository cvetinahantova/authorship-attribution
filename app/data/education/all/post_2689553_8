Im sitting here, in the band room, listening to the jazz band perform.  The wind ensemble and the percussion ensmeble have already done their thing.  Unbeknownest to me, however, until tonight, were 2 solos by Goss, our perc director, and Steph Miller, a fellow student of mine.  Although, technically it was a duet for steph, cuz Mrs. Klinger was playing as well.  Personally, I didn't like Goss's piece...it was too...random? yeah, thats the word.  It was "out there", so to speak.  One thing I really dislike about percussion ensemble, and the percussion section in band too, is that only 2 or 3 percussionists get the good parts.  Okay, well, they're all done now, so I'm outta here.
