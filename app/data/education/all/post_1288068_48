Wouldja take a look at the time? This time last week this would've been a perfectly normal time to be eating Crunchy Nut Cornflakes and getting all wet under the crappy shower but today I feel just wretched. The middle of the frigging night!  Anyhow, I am off to take my literacy test. It will be great to have a piece of paper saying I am literate. I'm sure glad all that exam stressing all those years ago wasn't for nothing. I'd hate to think that the TTA itself was implying, by making me take a half hour pop quiz invigilated by a trained chimp, that it held no stock whatsoever in the QCA and the very exams they are training us to prep kids for.   Forgive me; I am sleepy and cranky. xxx
