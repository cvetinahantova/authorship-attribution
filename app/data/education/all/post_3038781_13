Care to hear some good news?    I've been hired as an adjunct professor in the English program at my community college. It makes me a tiny bit nervous that Sen. Jim King, the presumed to be  honorable , but that's somewhat debatable, representative of Florida's citizen's has pushed through a budget cutting 1.1 million from the Volusia County's already underfunded schools on the grounds that it can be done because instructors are already on one of the lowest pay rates in the state of Florida despite the fact that our already diminished budgets have labeled us one of the "loser districts" for the past four years straight.   I wonder if King has considered, during any of his costly and state funded vacations, that the salaries already "kept down by amenities such as sunny beaches, cultural and recreational opportunities, climate, public services, and low taxes" are already so low that many teachers are taking second and third jobs at $6.00 an hour and lower just to make ends meet. During this Christmas season, I took a seasonal sales position at J.C. Penneys to scrape by and ran into 16 other instructors ranging from grade school teachers to community college instructors doing the same... just at that one store.   Also.. there's a big problem with this "amenities" argument: Although Volusia County has some cultural activities, it cannot be compared to the amenities offered at larger cities such as Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami, or Orlando. Additionally, we have no major sports teams, nor a major university like in Tallahassee or Gainesville. Volusia County has no seaport and few large businesses or employers. Looking at the big picture, I can't see why Volusia County children should be further deprived of needed supplies, instructors, and educational opportuntiies simply because we are located by a beach... that most teachers don't have the time to visit between their survival jobs.
