IT's such a shame to waste my short short vacation time before the new schol year starts again by watching The Ashlee Simpson Show..god, what a poser she is.  Everytime they show her recoring tracks, all it is is her fuckin up all the time...hm...maybe she doesnt have the cords her sister was blessed with.  Anyways...  Yesterday was a fun but long day.  Jenny, Sondra and I went to Newport Beach...one of my favoritest places in the world  :)  Its just so relaxing there...too bad it was obnly for a day.  I wish I could have slept there.  Oh well...another time hopefully.    So I don't have much to say.  Today was an okay day.  Sean went home to visit for the weekend.  Miss him.  I broke down and bought a needlepoint that I'm making for my mom.  Its kinda cool.  Its relaxing in a weird way, to just chill in front of the tv and do it.  :::Yawn:::  Whew I'm tired.  Been up since 7:30 am.  I'm thinkin about hittin the sack.  Yeah bed is goooodddd....  good night, NEVERLAND!!!!
