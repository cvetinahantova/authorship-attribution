Well, here I am, at my sister's house. Nothing going on really, hence my appearance on the computer. We went out and ran errands yesterday, and last night I acquired a bag of cd's to go copy onto my computer, but other than that we've just been sitting around the house. I saw this interesting show called 'Faking It' on TLC, where they take some random person (in this case a sheep-sheering kid from Colorado) and give them a couple weeks to learn a different profession (ie Hairstyling), and at the end, stick him in with a couple of seasoned pros to see if a judge can tell the difference. It was actually pretty cool, so I might have to watch that show again some time...  Anyway, I'm off now. I think I'll be home soon.  Current Music: Cranberries - Linger
