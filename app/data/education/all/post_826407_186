Helen, I and the team got back from Rome about 3pm this afternoon.  We have had an amazing time.  God has really shown up in our lives and in the places we went.  Thank you all for your prayers etc.  I will post in more detail some reflections, stories and maybe even pictures once my head has caught up and landed back in England.
