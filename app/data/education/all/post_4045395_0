After an entire day of thought, a simple moment smoking a cigarette revealed a little of what I thought this imperative might mean. While it's a little vague, I think that keeping the gods alive by thinking of them does them honor. One doesn't have to run to the heights and proclaim their existance. Nor, even, tout their meaning and importance to others through testimony of their roles in my life.   However much I might think of the them though, benevolent parents, I still did nothing to participate in the blue moon tonight. Does this make me a bad participant? Again this question of what are trappings of the religion and what is active faith. I spent the day in thought. Is it enough? What is? Should I spend of portion of each day sitting in front of candle meditating? How much time is enough? I know that only I can answer any of these questions based on my needs.  What's missing? Isn't this a question we all come to every now and then?  Today was the first day in a long time that I have felt overwhelmed by life's responsibilities. Many things to do for many people. Everyone of them pulling me their direction with claims of the importance of their need. That's just complaining. Never enough time. I am so tired.  I will set aside a day or two more for this first statement. The others that follow seem given to obviousness.
