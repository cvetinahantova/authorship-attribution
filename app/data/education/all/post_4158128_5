The only worthwhile thing I picked up in a week of college business management conferences is that you can create a blog for free. So, I thought maybe I should get into the action and create one. Not that my life is so terribly exciting that the world needs to hear it but since writing is an interest of mine I decided to put some words out there for everyone to check out.  My goal is to post several times a week-maybe more, maybe less.  Upcoming event: The Brickyard 400 is this weekend. This is the most overrated race of the season. A lot of hype for a race that's generally a total snoozer. I haven't been to Indy myself but those I know who do attend tell me it's not much more exciting live and in person. Will this be  Tony 's year to win? I hope so. Nothing would make me happier than to see Tony, Zippy and the rest of the team kiss the bricks. Good luck in quals tomorrow, Smoke!
