I have written 3 posts so far today.  Deleted all of them.  I'm not sure why my mind is so cluttered today.  I have so many topics I want to write about.   I will start one, write for a little bit, then get off track.  DELETE.  There it goes.  Then I will start a new topic.  and here we go again, I can't decide where to go with the topic and DELETE.  Away with you!   I've never had this much trouble with posting before.  Normally, I sit down, and jsut start typing.  Not today.  Maybe it is because life is in turmoil right now.  Mayb its because Tommy didn't wake me up this morning, and left without saying goodbye.  Maybe its because the boys have been sick for a week now, and the stress and worry of being mom to sick boys is getting to me.  Maybe the well is dry.  I don't know what it is, but I wish it would leave me alone.
