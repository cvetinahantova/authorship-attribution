Hello Hello. Well nothing has happen for a while soo yeah. I was thinking about my first luv. I feel like shit just thinking about it. I wanted to cry again. No one ever forgets thier first luv. I mean hopefully that person hasnt for got abotu me. Vuz if they did well...Yeah. There are soo many things I wish I could have done. They gave me their address. And I lost it. I feel soo dum for lossing something that could keep me connected to them. There are soo many things I wish I could have done. Im always in my room trying to think of a good song to write about it. But theres never a good song. And sometimes when I try to forget abotu it I end up finding a song about it. Im always wanting to cry about it. Soo now I hope that I can see this person once again. Cuz I think if we were really meant to be we would see each toher once again. I pray that we do. But I need to stop this thinking before I get real into it. Yeah Im done now. Bye!!XoxO
