I experienced hooliganism for the first time lastnight, not a personal disposition but of a second hand nature. Being in one of the many pubs around reading where they show the footy on the big screen (specially ones like lastnights Poms Vs. Frogs match) you should expect to see a nominal amount of high strung emotional tension throughout any particular game that involves the country where you currently reside. For me and the other staff of the Walkabout Inn - last night was no exception.  You could not imagine how charged the atmosphere was - like Jew in the belly of a zeplin trying to decide weather or not to play with the book of matches in his/her pocket.  And when the French won in the final seconds of the game it was like the floodgates of hell were let loose! The Jew struck a match.  I heard rumors about some of the bars around town being totally trashed, ours was okay - as our manager is quite picky about who we let in and who stays outside. There was a small amount of violence directly after the final whistle but the only things broken were a few plastic pint glasses, and about 700 peoples worth of pride. The bar staff were told to stay behind the bar, and behind Big Dave (door security) who's massive bulk covered one of the only entrances to our nice safe cozy bar area.   After the match during the walk home, the trail of devastation was quite evident, cars were kicked punched or generally mangled in many different ways and rubbish bins that are literally cemented in to the ground had been pulled out and tossed around like children toys.   The Mob, when many minds become one and the only thought that can possibly traverse them is one of destruction and chaos.
