She was awarded the Doctor of Educational Administration by Hofstra University.  Her teaching-research agenda includes leadership and team development in education and business settings.  Abstract:  The purpose of this study was to conduct an exploratory action research investigation of team units in an educational leadership course.  The instructor and action researcher presents her qualitative journey with seventeen graduate students who were registered in an educational leadership program.  Students were teachers and aspiring principals.  Results illustrated that students gained self-awareness and learned about the strengths and weaknesses of working in teams.  Team members provided multiple perspectives about their teams, which enabled the instructor to increase her understanding regarding team units.  The instructor was able to redesign her team instructional model or “action plan” concerning utilizing teams in the classroom.
