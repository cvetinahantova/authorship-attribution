My, the week is sure going by quickly!  Sorry it has taken me so long to post this Sunday's run info.  Anyway, here it is:  When:  Sunday, August 15th, 7:15 a.m. (step off at 7:30); walkers can meet earlier (7:00 a.m.) if you want to get started earlier.  What:  8 mile out-and-back course  Where:  Ponto Beach (South Carlsbad Beach)  Clinic:  The nutrition clinic has been cancelled due to a lot of subject overlap with MaryKay's clinic.  Directions:  I-5 Fwy. Exit at La Costa Ave. and head west. Turn right at Coast Hwy 101. Make a U-turn (illegal, so be careful) at the first light (Avenida Encinas) Entrance to the parking lot is on the right before you reach La Costa Ave. The entrance to South Carlsbad Beach (Ponto Beach) is easy to miss, so keep your eyes peeled.  As always, please let your mentor know if you cannot make it!!  Thank you, everyone!  See you on Sunday!  You all rock!!  Wendy
