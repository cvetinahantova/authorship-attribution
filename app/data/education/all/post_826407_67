Went to see Love Actually with Helen on Wednesday.  Yes it seemed to suggest that English people were all rich, hesitant and living in London, yes the start at the airport was manipulative and has been done better before, yes it featured more cameos than a series of Friends.  But none of that stopped me from loving it.  The affect it had on the audience was interesting; everyone came out with silly big grins.
