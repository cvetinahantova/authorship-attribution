Sorry I didn`t do a written post yesterday, but it was hectic enough with trying to get all those pictures from Tokyo up during the Natsu Matsuri.  Yesterday and today was Oshima-mura`s summer festival. The BOE office competed as a team in the tug of war contest. Sadly enough we lost (and with all that girl power too!) But a good time was had by all.  I ate all kinds of good foods and had that cider drink where the marble is in the bottle neck but you can still drink if it doesn`t roll to the opening.  I had chocolate ice cream and bought a fat stuffed elephant (I named him Bernie, he lives on my couch, and has his own pillow.... what, I need company!)  I also got a couple of those cool paper fans called uchiwa.  The day before I went swimming with Ako and Tamura-sensei, who says I can call her by her nickname, Kyo-chan.  Everyone calls me Brooki or Brooki-chan for a nickname.  Just now, my neighbor and the Jr. High gym teacher Yoshida-sensei made us some lunch, some udon noodles.  It was very good. Later he may teach me how to make onigiri , which are rice balls or triangles with a food inside like salmon or plum or whatever you like, then wrapped around with a piece of seaweed called nori.  I`ve always wanted to make those! They feed you really well around here. I think I caught a little cold from all the swimming and exercise and getting so hot though.  It was hard to get up this morning and I missed most of the sports festival.  But I think it is better to rest longer so I don`t get sick.  I have much to do this coming week I think.  I brought grits the other day, and it was interesting to explain. More later. Hosha ne.
