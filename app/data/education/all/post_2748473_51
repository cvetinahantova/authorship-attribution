Okay, lots of stuff going on here. I finally got to see my dearest Katie and Preston on Sunday and school is fixing to be out soon. I also am trying to sort through a lot of things in my head right now. I am sorting through my depression ish as well as trying to figure out who I am and certain relationships that I have with people. It is hard when you love someone but they make choices that you cannot accept.
