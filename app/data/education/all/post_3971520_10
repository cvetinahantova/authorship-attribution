Ok, so yesterday was a hard day for me. I am getting better each minute of the day and hopefully, I will have no trouble sleeping in this big, empty house. Everything takes time and I realize that, but sometimes I have to let the frustration out. You know? You know????? Kellie, what movie is that from? I am glad that today has gone better for me. I did get off to a rocky start today, but that all changed after my mom left. I guess I was just feeling so much pressure from seeing her and knowing that she was leaving. My co-workers are all very supportive and my new buddy Keisha (8th grade coach) has made me her 'white' sister. We are already so close and she and the other coaches make me feel safe and loved. Darla (Coach Bull) and I are going shopping for teacher stuff tomorrow, so that will be fun. She went to Tarleton with Judy Moore. She is a wild one and those are the kind of people that I like to hang out with.  Thanks for all of the encouraging comments yesterday. They were much needed and it is nice to know that you guys are there for me. I love you ALL! Ho, thanks for coming to see me. I needed it more than you know. Until tomorrow...later.
