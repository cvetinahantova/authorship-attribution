I've given up a time or two before, Half drowned by icy turmoil within. Emotions crest and break upon the shore, Drowning reason with their ever-present roar. I fight against the surge, but never win. I've given up a time or two before. A swell against the sand-the waves restore The smooth and untouched beauty once again. Emotions crest and break upon the shore. The icy fingers weave the ocean floor Drowning reason with their ever-present spin. I've given up a time or two before. My will comes broken, bleeding, washed ashore Beneath the rays of moonlight, small and thin. Emotions crest and break upon the shore, And things once right so often I deplore. Why must the mind be swayed by passing sin? I've given up a time or two before- Emotions crest and break upon the shore.
