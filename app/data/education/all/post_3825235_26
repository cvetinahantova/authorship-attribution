can't you hear the scream?Â  urlLink     urlLink     So, there it is, my first picture in the blog!  That day was so fun!  It was so hot that both of us were playing in the sprinkler, and she was having so much fun that I just had to shoot some photos.  Ah, the memories!  That day was the beginning of the end...of our side yard.  That was the day, the men came over and started to obliterate what was left after Mom and Dad added their room.  So much has changed, but I love it!  It looks so different, even to me, and I saw it unfold everyday.  This past weekend for the reunion, some relatives didn't even recognize the house when they came for dinner.  And they had been here only 2 months before!  Good times!
