Well unfortunately the internet has decided to stop working at home and I've had just about as much of daytime T.V as I can possibly bear so I've come down to the library to make the most of their free facilities along with the rest of the unemployed in this town.  The lengths I'll go to so that I can keep my friends in the picture...    I have to say that I'm still feeling pretty glum after the interview.  Coming back here has been a real anti-climax and I spent most of the weekend moping around at home and watching TV, neither of which are going to help me get a job.  I tried to write a covering letter today so that I can send out a batch of C.V's to the old language schools in London but predictably enough I didn't get very far.  I spent an hour writing phrases and then crossing them out before they dared to become fully fledged sentences before deciding to have a break for lunch.  After a quick toasted cheese sandwich I went back to my bedroom to stare at my C.V, stare at the 'covering letter', get in a temper and decide to get out of the house for a bit in the hope that I would find some inspiration.  Jesus, I'm making heavy weather of this and I hate myself for it.  At least I've found out that Yarmouth library has copies of the Yellow Pages for London so I'll have all the appropriate names and addresses once I eventually *have* cobbled some kind of cover letter together.  I only have four minutes and seventeen seconds of free internet access left and there's a queue of kids from Frisby's School of English who are eager to leap into my place as soon as I've finished so I suppose I'd best call it an afternoon here.  I'll try and keep morale up and keep you all posted.
