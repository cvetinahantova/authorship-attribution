I slept for a while... I don't remember if I slept on the couch, or on my floor, or both, but whatever. I just know I got some sleep, and I didn't eat.  I'll be off at Nate's tomorrow, putting down sod in part of their yard. Yeah.  Well, I'm gonna go find out what we had for dinner.  Current Music: The Beatles - The Long and Winding Road
