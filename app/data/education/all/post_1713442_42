urlLink Yahoo! Sports Fantasy Football  Yes, it is time once again for the NFL season to kick off.  That means fantasy football at Yahoo.  As usual, I will run two teams in the free public leagues.  I will keep with my traditional team names of the Dowling Ninjas and Gweeb's Warriors.  I realize I may be one of the few librarians into fantasy football, but I can't help it.  It makes football games so much more interesting when I am rooting for players.  I will watch games with teams I could care less about because I am hoping a running back will score tons of touchdowns and get big yardage.   My LIB 197 class went well yesterday.  I introduced my students to LC call numbes and the online catalog.  Having them work along with me on computers as I lecture really helps for a better and more attentive group of students.
