Alright, if you didn't catch this last night you all should watch it tonight on E! (ch. 50) from 8 to 11.   The Real World, Saved by the Bell,  Baywatch, and Friends are just a few of the shows that started.  Hot stars like Pamela Anderson and George Clooney (ER) showed up on TV.  And the Spice Girls were making music and MC Hammer was dancing in his special funky pants.  Who misses the 90s?  I do.  Watch on E! tonight.
