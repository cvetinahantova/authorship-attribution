Savannah was on her way home, 2 hours away from home, and her ammonia is going up again.    THey are in between hospitals, and nothing they can do.  Theya re pretty much hopeless until they get back to the hospital here.    Hospitals don't normally keep the medications that Savannah needs on hand, so they can't stop at jsut any hospital.  Pray for them.  Please.
