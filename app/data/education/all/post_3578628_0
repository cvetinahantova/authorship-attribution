Hey...just to remind everyone...AGAIN...I'm leaving July 2nd.  Don't ask me to go anywhere...or do anything...or anything like that....I'm needed here.  Have questions...email me and I'll get back to you AFTER vacation.  I'm a bit MAD to say the least right now...but I'm not going to be available so don't try calling or doing anything for right now.  Josh...I'll take care of you before I leave.    For all of you other people...enjoy the month and try not to party too much while enjoying your graciously given freedom....
