You know, I've just discovered something about myself I'm not really proud of. Di ko kayang pumasok sa isang BF-GF relationship.  Ewan ko ba kung ano ang dahilan kung bakit ako ganito.  Am I afraid of what it entails? Am I ashamed to admit to the world that I am in a relationship like that? Am I too perfectionist that I believe that my first will be my last? Or that there is that ONE AND ONLY person that is RIGHT for me? Don't I love the other person enough?  But last night, while I was talking with a close female colleague from GS, I was suddenly faced with the option to take our relationship to the next level.  And being the chicken-hearted asshole that I am, I didn't take it.  I've hurt her in the process.  I've hurt us both in the process.  Last night was a really sad night for me. Until now, di pa rin ako makatawa.  Have I really fallen for this girl? Or am I just falling because she has already fallen? Di rin naman yata tama yun kung ganun.  Is there something there? Or is it merely something physical and coincidental?   tangina talaga...
