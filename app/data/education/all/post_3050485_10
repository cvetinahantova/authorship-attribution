stupid. that is what i call myself at the moment.  i thought that today, monday, the uniform for the day is blue. so it was to my surprise when i arrived in the library that i noticed that most were wearing white. my god, i wore the wrong color for monday. considering that we were told during orientation that there would be 10 point deduction for improper uniform, there was nothing for me to do but to rush back to my room in roxas and quickly changed.  right now, i am back in the library. i guess stupid is what i really i should call myself today. my fingers are crossed that i would have a better luck for my exams later.  ciao
