Hi all--I am also doing my runs here on the east coast in Maine...with Mary Kay's help I have been able to alleviate my shin splint pain from early last week and am continuing to be on track. (pardon the pun!!) While I am ramping up slowly from partial walk/run I plan to run that race in Oct-who's with me??  I am anxious to meet everyone when I return next week...will be at the Aug 8th run for sure. Keep up the good work-Karen Dillen
