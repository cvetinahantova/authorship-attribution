Hi all,  There is another blogging issue that I would like to mention here, just to clarify a point that some people have been confused by.  If you have a blog -  any  blog - that is in any communication whatsoever with the 8S group, it counts as a "school" blog.  Setting up a "school" blog and a "personal" blog will not get you out of following the rules.  You are still accountable for what you write in any blog that is seen by anybody in 8S, or by me. As you know, one of the major points of the blog project is learning your responsibilities as digital citizens, and as such you are responsible for  everything  you post, no matter where it is.  Zoe
