Yesterday went by quickly, I slept a lot.  I guess it was a combo of my CFS, PMS, etc.  Then I had a performance at the American Cancer Society Fundraiser that Kim was in charge of.  In fact, I saw her and her dad on the news last night.  It's pretty cool to see people you know on tv.  I need to get some stuff done around he house today!  John comes home tonight, rather than tommorow night like he usually would on his three day work weekend.  He has tomorrow off becuase it's our first anniversary!  I can't wait to celebrate it.  It's an occasion I've never celebrated before!  I quess the hotel we are going to has a nice early bird special for dinner, its like a 6 course meal or something like that!  I think we will dress up a little (that means getting John out of his jeans =)).  We are also picking up our cake top.  The lady who made our cake, makes a remake of you cake top for you 1st anniversary (so it tastes a lot better than a year old one).  It's $15, and we must save mom and dad a piece.    My car, ahh, my car.  It appears we have almost 1,000 in repairs to do on it.  Well, wonder how Rachel's Saturn is doing, becuase mine just took a sudden dive.  Well, quess this is all for today.  Won't be writing for a few days, casue I'll be off with my love. J
