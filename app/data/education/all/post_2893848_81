I was watching TV tonight and came across "Dick Tracy."  Nevermind for a moment that with its set design this movie gives feature-length product placement to  urlLink the Avery Corporation.   I was much more taken by the resemblence between  urlLink William Forsythe 's  urlLink Flattop  and perhaps history's most obvious OCD crooner,  urlLink Billy Corgan .  I couldn't find a pic of Forsythe as Flattop, but I did find  urlLink this  , which is probably cooler anyway.  You think these two are secretly brothers?  There's no particular reason to think so, but its pretty clear that they would be embarrassed enough by each other to keep the secret.  I've always thought Forsythe was a pretty badass motherfucker, and that makes me think that if these two were brothers, perhaps it was Forsythe's vicious, childhood beatings of Billy that proved inspiration for all those sad sad songs.  But then again, the guy's an actor.  I don't know many actors, but it is hard to imagine any of those drama kids from high school beating up anyone.
