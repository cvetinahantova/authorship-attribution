Here's a glorious photo of the Greek winners of the synchronized diving competition. (I tried to post it directly, but the Hello program that I use for that wasn't cooperating.)   urlLink Yahoo%21 News - Sports Photos - Reuters   I've been watching and enjoing the Olympics enormously, but it is disillusioning how closely related to wealth athletic success is. The countries with large economies field gigantic teams, whereas countries like Congo, with 60 million people, can only send out a couple of athletes. I guess this really became obvious on the South African team, where the majority of the athletes are white although the majority of the citizens of South African are of course black. So the Olympics is one of those supposed meritocracies that really go back to economics. Typical nineteenth-century liberalism. But what can you do?
