Ok, so I was sleeping last night (as usual). And I've had dreams about her numerous times before. But this was different. Very. Different.  But this dream was completely contrary to all the dreams that I've had about Courtney. In the rest of the dreams, she avoided me, she didn't say a word. In this one... she was like... an actual person. I bumped into her in the hall, and I remember thinking, "Aww, God damn it, she's going to be a bitch." But she wasn't. She apologised, talked to me, and said she was sorry about what happened, and that she hadn't meant for that to happen, all of what she said was just to preserve her reputation, etc etc. She also looked... very beautiful. I was like... "WHAT?!", at least in my mind, but had a major conflict of interest. I couldn't decide. In the end, I remember talking to her, and that was that. That was the end. It was weird.  Why did this happen? Are my feelings for her resurfacing after all?
