It really is wonderful to be outside.  I think that something is changing in the hardware of the American making the inside lifestyle the way most people live their lives.  Work, play, and rest all take place in a safe and sterile environment.  This is understandable, this is easier in a culture that demands ease.  But what of the repercussions?  There is little to demonstrate just what effect this will have upon us.  It made me fat and out of shape, a mere shadow of the lean powerhouse I once was.  How many others fall into this trap?  There was a man who was over 1,000 lbs. brought to a Nebraska hospital.  I don't think he was being all that primal.  Were our parents exposed to this type of situation?  I can't tell.  But somewhere, someone is living the caveman life.  I just wish it was me.
