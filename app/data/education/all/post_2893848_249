urlLink These   urlLink girls  claim to be angry; so why don't they sound angry?  I blame Alanis Morrisette.  She made anger therapeutic and acceptable in all the wrong ways.  Somehow, being pissed off got conflated with being empowered, which puts the emotion in a very awkward position.  Go break some shit, will you?
