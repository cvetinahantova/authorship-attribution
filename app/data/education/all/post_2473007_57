After a late start out of Edison, NJ, and a tiring luggage haul through Penn Station, I finally settled in a comfortable car headed north through Poughkeepsie and into Hudson.  We followed the Hudson River the entire trip, with its snake-like windings glistening in the midday sun, and I was surprised at how enchanting its veiled banks are.  My experience with her was limited to glimpses from the highway in Albany and a solitary panorama from the Rip Van Winkle Bridge just outside of Catskill.   Following her up from Manhattan, however, introduced me to the quaint river I had not before known.  We moved quickly from urban to suburban, and then about twenty miles along, great heaping mounds of forested hill sprung up and gave the river a wildness that New York City has stolen from the harbor.   Up toward Rhinecilff the train sped up, but the scenery slowed down.  Two herons gossiping in a swampy sidenote heard the train and showed their great wings.  The rushes and swamp grasses are more populace further north, with the appearance of a few disinterested islands to hide them.  About ten minutes from the Hudson depot, a small cottage, sitting a piece of island almost as small and looking much like an abandon lighthouse, stood guard of the sleeping giants.  These mountains are less juvenile, more Catskill; no abrupt knobs or drops.  They are softer but more potential; less unpredictable and more certain.   Ah - Van Winkle.  The bridge I have only known from above - tall and slender, stately and grand, grasping both shores as if to pull the earth together in some Herculean stunt.  This perspective is much more overwhelming - much like life - greater, different, but ultimately truth.  What is a bridge until you have explored its underbelly?  What is it until you've seen that which keeps it standing?
