Yesterday I got a really awsome deal.  Fred's (which is like a one stop shopping place in the NW) was having an extra 50% of on clearnce items.  They had this really neat dark dark blue ceramic vases with white glaze dripping down.  I got two tall and skinny ones and one short and fat.  They look great on our fire place hearth! I love the olymics, and I am so excited for them to get started.  I love the gymnastics, swimming, and track and feild the best.  I always find myself wanting to be one of those athletes.  I remember when I was little, after seeing ice skating on tv I would slide around on our wood floor hall way, pretending to ice skate.  I think the olympics are extra exciting this year, becuase they are in Greece, the origin of the olymic games!  The opening cermony is tonight!  I'm going out to lunch with mom today.  I got her a few little things on our trip I'll give her then.  It will also be nice to tell her all about our trip.
