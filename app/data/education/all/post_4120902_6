My brother sang Januari last night! Oh my God!! It was wonderful, great, best, excellent and aarghhh... tak tahu nak cakap aper dah!! memang powerful giler.. Now i can say something that i wish i could say it long time ago. When watching Malaysian Idol with my buddies, I can say... " That is my beloved brother". Bro, you are the greatest singer i've ever known... keep on you good work and as usual, my supports are always with you.
