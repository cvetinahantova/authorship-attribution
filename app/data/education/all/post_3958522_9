9:00 AM        I wake up this morning just like any other Sunday morning. I didn’t wake up at a certain time because I don’t have a morning church to go to. Not that they are all bad, I just don’t have it in me to go to a morning service. Well today is one of those days that my creative and energetic God is asking me to do something totally different and outrageous. He asked me to go to church. “Why God?” is my first question, as I entertain thoughts of a big sweaty man shaking my hand at the front door and Saturday Night Live’s Dana Carvey’s character impersonation of church lady who tells everyone that they are in with satan. “Do I have to wear a tie God,” I ask?             So God is asking me to go to St. John’s Episcopal Church this morning. Yes that’s right, Jehovah God in all his infinite post-modern wisdom is asking me, an semi-anti-traditionalist, house church leader, and progressive thinker, to go sit, kneel, and look at man in a strange dress (actually turned out to be a woman) who plasters his hair to his head and raises his right hand a lot to look like the Jesus of Renaissance art. How do I know it’s going to be this way? Well I must tell you that I was Episcopal for the first 7 years of my life until the Baptists showed me the way to true abundant life through their bearded preacher with khakis. Oh yeah, remember that Baptist preacher who had that infamous stain on their shirt from one of his many kids, which turns into an illustration about why we need to be saved?             Now I am wondering what to expect. I have about an hour to talk myself out of going.    If I don’t go, I won’t have to miss my Sunday morning meditation coffee event. St. John’s Episcopal Church here I come with tie, a semi-forced smile, and shiny black shoes. I bet a ton of pretty rich girls are going to be there too.                  9:17 AM        All sarcasm aside, I am expecting to find God in a really cool and new way this morning. If I didn’t, it wouldn’t be worth posting this long story on blogger.              12:26 PM (as told as if it was 10:30 AM)     I arrive first admiring the art work/ stained glass. My senses are mildly focused on the atmosphere and majorly focused on the experiences of those around me. Catholic churches are much more extravagant. For the most part people weren’t happy. “This ain’t no house church,” I keep saying to myself. Surprisingly there are very few girls to look at, and even less single 20 somethings. Perhaps this is telling of the relevance of this church structure to its family and even more telling of my intentions here.              There is meaning in those stain-glass windows as each window had a theme. The themes range from a super-spiritual Jesus with winged lions and cows, angels, and flaming swords in the panes to carpenter Jesus with wheels, steamboats, some funky looking pipe, and an airplane. I am actually really impressed that art was used in a creative way. The church at 2500 Preston has pictures of Brittany and Madonna kissing, a girl drinking Dawn, someone pouring laundry detergent in a gas tank, and a Canadian love song singer giving the thumbs up.               Scripture reading is the really depressing stuff from Ecclesiastes and the whole service is centered on how all riches and high-class comforts are vanity and selfish, although this of course is never directly said. I get very emotional because it is obvious that Jesus is not being admired, adored, and given honest attention that he should get in church.              I take communion. It is wine! The church at 2500 Preston St. should have wine.               At the very beginning of the service I watch a thirty year old mother sit down on the opposite end of the pew I am on. She gives her small son to Dad and kneels to pray before the service. This reminds me of going to Church of the Redeemer Episcopal when I was five, and kneeling beside my moma as she prayed before the service started. Daddy was in church about half of the time, so it was natural for me to be doing exactly what moma was doing. I can remember the passion in my moma’s prayers even then, as I vaguely can see her praying with tears in her eyes. You see my mom found God in those two or three years. Now I am finding God in these years as a result. I don’t give credit to that church or to my Mom’s necessity for God through her degrading marriage, but to a God who works beyond church structure to the heart of His loved children. I believe with all my heart that you can go to St. John’s Episcopal Church, hear the voice of the Lord while you are there, and create community centered on Jesus. I thank the Lord that is bigger than our ideas of church.
