Boys Will Be Boys!     As promised, here is a little insight into life at Shiogama Boys High School.  Well, with April came tons of new first year students, a schedule consisting of 6 classes (only there 2 days a week), and team-teaching with different Japanese teachers of English (JTE`s).      Anyway, the first lesson for each class consisted of my self-introduction.  I had created 40 flash cards, 28 with questions to ask me and 12 cards of questions students had to answer about themselves.  There are 40 students in each class so each student was randomly given 1 card.  The cards were numbered and card by card each student had to stand and ask me a question or offer information about their likes and dislikes while I responded with maps, pictures, etc on the board.  Well, in my second year commercial class, a student stood up and told me that his favorite color is blue.  As I began to repeat his answer so everyone could hear it clearly, he started yelling "wait! wait!" in English.  I had no choice but to wait and he had effectively gained the attention of every student. He then went on to say "And my favorite woman is Lindsey" in perfect English.  I was a little embarrassed to say the least.      As my British friends would say, my boys are quite cheeky.  After the presentation part, the students all had a worksheet to fill out.  The top half about me and the bottom half about them.  When I returned to the staff room I could not have imagined what I was sitting down to read and mark.  Lindsey was some of the boys favorite food, one students favorite sport is masturbation... I of course then went and showed Yuko and a few of the other teachers and we all had a few laughs in the teachers room. I am in for a few interesting months at the boys school!
