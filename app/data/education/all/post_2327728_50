I just got my hair cut, and I think it looks like ass.  But it will grow, I guess.  Still, it makes me want to grow it out again.  I was having a discussion with Mandy, and together, we had an apiphany about Hali.  Haligonians aren't assholes (although I am reluctant to let that one go), they are just improperly socialized.  Halifax is so small, that when a person says "Hey we should get together sometime and chill" they really mean "the next time we run into each other, which will obviously be very soon because halifax is the size of a dime, let's not pretend we don't know each other".  I am used to Edmonton, which is an *actual* city, and if you want to see someone again, you'd better get a number, and you'd better call it.  This is why I have been getting so down - I hand my number out to people all the time (read: girls - cuz guys here are ass), and I expect to hear from them, say, the next time they go out, because that's what people do in Edmonton.  But I don't, and I sit at home, and curse the bitch who said we should chill.  Mandy is the bitch.  Not really, since we are obviously friends, but she say the other point.  There was a girl she met through friends who said "We should chill" and Mandy agreed.  And then she called.  Mandy thought it was weird and awkward, but invited her out with friends for a night out.  She said it was like a date, and didn't really understand what this girl wanted from her, becuase really, they were bound to see each other again.  My point: IF YOU DON'T MEAN SOMETHING, DON'T FUCKING SAY IT!  Sometimes I think I have a touch of Asperger's Syndrome (a mild form of autism) because I can't read between the lines. And I have no time for games or innuendo.  I think it makes me scary sometimes, particularly in halifax.  "Oh my gawd, isn't that the girl who actually says what she means?"
