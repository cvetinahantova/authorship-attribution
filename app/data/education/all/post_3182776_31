Another night of resourcing and job applications comes to an end. Despite Carla’s protests that I’m working too hard, I still haven’t been able to contrive to finish any earlier than half past ten this week. Maybe her day has more hours in it than mine. I suspect she doesn’t sleep.  Today I taught the same lesson to 9GG as I did last week. Back then, if you remember, it was ‘not quite your best lesson, Rob’, or something like that. This week, however, it was ‘seriously good’. NO IT BLOODY WASN’T! IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME! My mentor is a lovely bloke, but I think art teaching is the fastest route to schizophrenia. I know I’m nearly halfway there, and I’ve only just started.   My career seems to be going nowhere fast already though. Where the bollocks are my interviews? My supporting statement wasn’t that bad, surely?  Anna came round tonight for tea and inane chit-chat with me and Nils. We regaled her with nonsense about the internet and How to Become a Dark Lord of the Sith in Twelve Simple Steps, not to mention the knotty problem of whether a drib is bigger than a drab, or not. Sorry Sis.  I’m off to play Gamecube till bedtime. Which isn’t long.   Fucksake.
