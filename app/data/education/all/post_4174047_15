urlLink    This is a dedication to the near glorious run the  urlLink Calgary Flames  made this year in the Stanley Cup Finals. I waited 15 years for this and I was stuck here in Korea, but at least all the games were on AFKN. (the american forces tv station) It is a well known fact to everyone who knows me that I bleed Calgary Flames red. Thanks to my best bro' Dave for sending me the Flames package. In case you don't know that display of trophies is from Mcdonald's, I picked those gems up in Feb. when I visited Calgary for the Super Summit pond hockey tourney. Guns a blazin...Calgary Flames hockey.
