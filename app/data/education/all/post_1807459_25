Wow the unexpected joy of reading people's blogs while they are partying away in Seoul.  I was sure I would have to wait until Monday or Tuesday to read about the crazy Birthday happenings in the capital of Korea.  But as luck my have it my computer savvy friends found the time to write while they are there.  How great is that?  Guess it shows how crazy I'm going being stuck here?  Well I checked the FedEx tracking number Scott gave me and he definitely sent it but looks like it will get here Monday or Tuesday.  Not too shabby.  Poor Braves, lost again.  The Cubs pitching is killing them.  I'm waiting for them to whip out the whoop ass but instead I'm settling for them get beat.  Answer time. 1) $1.19 you figure out the change 2) The noble prize 3) St. Louis 1904 4) 5- St. Louis, Mexico City, L.A., Atlanta and Montreal   Georgia National Fair is in town but I think I'll skip out.  Same old stuff from when I was a kid.  I really don't like any of the rides and I'm of the age I realize I'm not going to win anything even close to the dollar I'd have to pay to try, so I'll just cop out.
