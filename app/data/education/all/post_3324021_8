As we approach the end of the year, it is clear that things are starting to settle down. Classes are finished with their work, next years Student Association will meet in the upcoming weeks. This means one thing ... Less posting. With the exception of Homecoming Preparation, no Student Government events take place in the summer. Thank you for reading this year, and there will be periodic updates over the vacation months.  ~Alex Morgan
