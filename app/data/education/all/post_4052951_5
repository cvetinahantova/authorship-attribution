The following space has been rented out by a yet-unnamed sponsor. At this point, the sponsor demands that I insert a post explaining that he has rented out the space. Therefore, any other sponsors cannot sponsor my blog without first receiving permission from the yet-unnamed sponsor.  Please address any legal concerns to this yet-unnamed sponsor. The sponsor does not have any religious, political, or legal affiliations. Therefore, most concerns will be unrecognized, except in the big scheme of things.  Please understand that this sponsorship is neither permanent nor temporary (or permanent). The sponsorship exists for the purpose of fulfilling all religious, political, or legal affiliations with the sponsor and the blog. Therefore, the blog cannot accept any affiliations unless they are or include some nature of religious, political, and legal affiliations. Any noteworthy mention will be censored or recognized by the process of due process (or another process deemed noteworthy or mentionable at the time the process is due).  To honor the affiliation of the sponsorship (but not the affiliations of the sponsor, because the previously mentioned yet unnamed sponsor has no affiliations), this blog will be accepting new sponsorship.  Please direct all queries to the proper forum unless otherwise noted.
