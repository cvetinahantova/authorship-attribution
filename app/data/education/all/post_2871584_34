Wow!  Well, I signed in twenty minutes ago to post, and discovered that blogger has undergone some pretty major changes.  New options, new designs, and as you can see, new templates.  I'm not sure how much I really like this one, but for now, it's a change.  Tomorrow, when I'm not quite so tired, I'll look around a little more.  Who knows what I'll end up with.  Anyway, you may be wondering why I'm so tired right now.  Well, that's because I was asleep.  I was just asleep.  I was in that "I just hit deep sleep and am out for the night" stage.  Then... yep, you guessed it.  The fire alarm went off.  Now, I have lived here for just over a month now.  That's what... four weeks?  I have, in that four weeks, been here for four fire alarms.  What the hell?!  And I've noticed that they almost always seem to be Tuesday night/Wednesday morning.  I'm sure that has *nothing* to do with the fact that I have Wednesdays off.  Mmhmm.  So this time, thankfully, it wasn't raining/sleeting outside.  It was actually fairly nice.  The game here is, as soon as security arrives, they tell us which apartment set it off, and we spend the rest of the time outside making smartass comments to that person.  So they tell us this time that it was apartment 302.  All right.  But... she wasn't outside with us.  She got smart, and went out the front door, which is for emergency exit only.  It turns out, she was ironing right under the alarm.  Come on already.  I mean, it's really nice to live in a building that has competent smoke alarms, but I've now seen it set off by dust from the vacuum, burned toast, an iron, and one unknown factor, because I was too annoyed to wait and hear what the problem was.  Let's just wait until there's really smoke before it goes off again, ok?  I'm going to try to get back to sleep again.  If I'm up for hours at this point, apartment 302 is going to hear about it.
