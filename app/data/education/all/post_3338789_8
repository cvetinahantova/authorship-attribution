Well, Well, Well.  It's Wednesday. Again.  My family is in town (parents, brother, and his wife) but sort of not. They got here on Sunday and have been in and out the entire time they've been here.  Yesterday they went to Chicago, today to Madison. My parents will come back tonight but bro and sister in law will not be back until tomorrow night.    My brother-in-law's wedding is this Saturday. I'm going to go practice my singing tonight for the last time before the wedding. I certainly hope I don't screw things up!  I'm beginning to wonder if I'm going to be able to make it through the ceremony without my voice cracking or wavering...I certainly hope I can do it.  I need to get the papers put together on something better so they don't go flying while I'm trying to sing. That would be a BAD thing. :)  Still bothered that I'm not considered "wedding party" but there's nothing I can do about it.  We got our new kitchen table last Friday and it looks awesome.  I wonder if I have brain enough figure out how to put a picture up. Hm.  Perhaps look here for a link at the end.  If it asks for a password, it's Gen.  Aside from all that, there's really not a whole lot going on.  Tomorrow and Friday I am having parties for my first grade French students.  We should have a good time-I am introducing them to some French foods and we're going to play games like pin the flag on the eiffel tower and the like. Hooray! :)  Time to go...J's almost home and he'll be hungry...   urlLink My table, half the chairs recovered
