Since I now go into work later than I used to, I have some time in the mornings to write inane things on my blog.  Actually, what I've done for the past few has been play with website related things - trying to actually host this on purplepen, which ive done a good imitation of (until some people picked up comcast as my address....booo...use purple pen!), and play with money-related things.  I am going to be unsuccessful in my attempted acquisition of a car this weekend, and just generally unsuccessful in my quest to be independent.  I'm not sure how people do it - i know people don't make much more than I do, and I'm not sure how they end up paying more and living much better than I do.    Leshon pointed out to me that many of them are living off of credit cards, and stuff like that, and Mark (indirectly) provided an example of people's parents just supporting them - purchasing condos for them, etc.  I don't understand it - I feel like prices are spiraling out of control, but I'm still trying to live independently, pay for my own education (well, through my own loans ;) and manage my own finances, purchase a car (no bank would ever take a chance on me) and live my own life.  I never recieved any financial education from my parents or through school, and within a year of attempting independence i was in serious trouble.  That trouble continued to dog me, and continues to dog me, and i dont know how i got into it, let alone how to get out of it.  Now I'm trying to pull my life back together, financially, educationally, and emotionally, and all i keep asking is "why can't I ever catch a break?" which is ridiculous, because there are lots in worse circumstances.  Actually, I dont want to meet one who is worse than me (because I can't say I know many personally), but I want to meet one who WAS worse than me, and has made herself better.  Oh well.
