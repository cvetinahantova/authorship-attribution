I mentioned i've been thinking about time travel. Well that's because i have. One of the best arguments to ever go nowhere ever. Lots of fun though when there's not much else to talk about.  We always seem to get hooked on the argument that if i go back in time and kill my father before i was born, the i wouldn't have been born to kill my father and therefore time would curl in on itself and the universe would implode/explode/turn into a pink elephant. Been wondering if time could be made three dimensional rather than one. This would allow loops and all sorts of sideways jumps, where you could potentially loop back on yourself and alter your lif without actually destroying a future timeline by erasing it's past. It will have still happened, but looped back on itself in order to redirect. Kinda hard to explain without a diagram.  The reason i was thinking about this (and i doubt i'm the first to think like this, i'll lay claim to a reasonable amount of intellect, but there are others way sharper than me out there) was as i was attempting to reconcile the concepts of predestination vs free will (if you haven't guessed already i'm a christian, and a scientist, and i hate not knowing answers if i think it can be worked out), and also a concept of understanding how the trinity could possibly function, without our minds imlpoding under the onslaught of multiple dimensional beings....Anyway, it all started in some theoretical physics book i was reading and it went from there. One of the most succinct and understandable revelations of the trinity was this guy using the theoretical particle physics of male/female subatomic particles to explain it. Really Awesome.  I'm not going to ramble anymore, but if you want more details of my thoughts i'll do my bset. They're not really that intersting though unless this is your topic area...
