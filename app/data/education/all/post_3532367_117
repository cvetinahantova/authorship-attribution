Tonight was interesting. On my way home I had popped in to assess a network install and do some email faults for a customer. With the money from that and the job on Thursday, I bought a drinks bottle and pump for the bike and a rear "eye level" brake light for the car.  I was in the process of fitting the parts to my bike, when Sandra phoned. Our friend over the way had called her as their daughter had come off her bike - could I go round? Despite being a nurse, Sandra hates first aid, so I obliged and the girl went off for X-Rays to her elbow.  We kept hold of the younger daughter, while the rest of the family went to hospital. By the time they got back, we had next doors lad in with a fractured collarbone. He had done it previously, but wanted his sling re-done. There were kids and parents everywhere.  We ended up having the youngest daughter over on a stop over, when they asked at the most awkward time. We felt as though we were in a position and couldn't say "no"......KIDS!
