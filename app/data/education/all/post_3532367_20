Well first the good news - I can have a drink (upto 2 pints) anything more will react with my medication.  The rest of the appointment was really stressful, I was the last to go in and spent a good 40 minutes with the doctor. I confessed to everything, from the nose bleeds, not sleeping, feeling down and angry, to eating, spending 120 quid when i only went out for 20 quid speakers, having sex with strangers off websites and sexually abusing my wife.  She phoned through a counseling appointment while I was there and told me that I am now identifying things as being wrong, so that is a sign of getting better. I have 2 months supply of tablets and will be on them for "a long time to come" and have to see her again in a month.  Her suggestion to when I am feeling out of sorts (or not able to sleep) is to exercise - run, walk, cycle - anything to increase my endorphines, even if its the middle of the night!!! She said no to sleeping aids at this stage. She also said that this is what I should have done instead of registering for the dating website.   I should also confess to Sandra about the true cost of my spending for speakers in order to humiliate myself and to go out only with cash, not cards.  Her concern with the marriage is Sandra's refusal to see Relate. She said I should try and mention it again and if Sandra was not in agreement then it must be that deep down, she may really want a divorce. In her words "you are trying really hard, your wife needs to put something into it as well", "the lines of communication need to be re-established". She also suggested that Sandra may well know about my sexual activities and has chosen to ignore them for the sake of the kids - something I have not contemplated before. Sandra's last response to me mentioning Relate was "It's you with the problem don't bring me into it again" - basically she is scared of opening out to a stranger about her intimate feelings, and I am scared of asking her again.
