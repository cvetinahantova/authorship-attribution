urlLink I love Ruby    The programming language, not the stripper. I mean, I loved it before - after all, I'm pretty much the one that argues that it should replace Java as the language used to teach OOP - but every time I use it I am amazed at how  good  it is at anticipating what I need to do. It is truly the  urlLink pragmatic programmer's  language.
