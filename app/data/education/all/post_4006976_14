It's been so weird today.  There's so much smoke, you can barely see the sun and everything thing has an eery orange tinge to it.  We couldn't see what the fire was doing all day because of the smoke but apparently it's still burning away from Kelowna.  All day, white ash fell like a light snow flurry.  Ernie's throat has been scratchy and the smoke really bugs him.  For me, it just burns my nose, but I've been thinking about all the people like your kids who have asthma etc.  The air quality is extremely bad right now.
