Maryland - Finding out that my website is not gone after all.  There was a weekend of panic as I think I did something to erase my site...but luckily, my pal Erik has everything backed up, so we should be up and running again within a day.  Woo Hoo.  I am in Maryland today speaking at South Carroll High School and then to a parent group tonight.  Then I am off to New Jersey for the rest of the week.
