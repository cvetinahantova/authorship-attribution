I started  urlLink Natasha  yesterday.  I've read  two stories and both were great.  I know a  urlLink lot  of  urlLink reviews  have compared Bezmozgis to Isaac Babel, and even though this is just the sort of comparison that annoys the hell out of me, like I'm buying a brand or something, it's actually pretty accurate.  I like Babel, I like Bezmozgis, though the latter's tendency to write about stoned ethnics and their dogs is troubling to me on a personal level.  I never thought someone would beat me to the market with  that  subject matter.  Fucker.
