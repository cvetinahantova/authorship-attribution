$\mathbb{E}[lara's anticipated graph theory grade]  0$  (you might be a math person if you know what on earth i typed that in...) (you might have been an analysis student at some point if you can make sense of what it says!)  i solved absolutely no new problems today despite working most of the time since i woke up at 10... why do i even bother staying up this late?  for all epsilon > 0, my enthusiasm for the rest of this semester is definitely bounded above by epsilon, and my anticipation to move on to summer break is bounded below by 1/epsilon.  1 more week til freedom...
