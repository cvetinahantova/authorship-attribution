One of the most anticipated pieces of entertainment this fall is not a CD. It is the book and mniniseries of    urlLink Long Way Round   , the literary and film documentary of Ewan McGregor's motorcycle trip around the world. He got hit by a car, crashed his bike into a Mongolian river and turned into a mountain man, but he is ALIVE 3 mos after starting the journey.  This  urlLink fansite  also has some information.  Also a funny section on  urlLink fan encounters  with Ewan. May the force be with you!
