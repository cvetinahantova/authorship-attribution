Morning world! And what a beautiful day it is today!  Yes you are right, it is 05:00. I woke at midnight, 02:00, 02:30 and 04:00. Don't know why. By 04:30 I decided enough was enough and I ventured out for my first 'morning' run. While I was getting changed, Sandra woke and asked what I was doing. I told her I was going for a run....unless she wanted sex. She was silent and I took that to be a "no"!  I jogged up to the local football pitch and did a couple of circuits, with short bursts of "running", before jogging back. Half an hour in total, but more than enough for me to experience bursting lungs, aching legs and a sweaty back....nice.  And just to prove the point, I decided to blog it now, rather than later ;-) I dont feel tired though....
