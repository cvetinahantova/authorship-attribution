well here it is. my first blog post.  i'm really starting one just to give me something to do during my breaks at work. i just sit around and surf the net usually. at least now i can vent my frustrations online for a bit also.  i doubt anyone will be reading this anyway (since i probably won't tell anyone anyway), but just in case you are, stay tuned for many posts of south korea, politics, philosophy, religion and anything else i feel like rambling about.
