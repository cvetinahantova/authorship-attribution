I went to the store for my mom, I come home and Tommy is crouched down in the yard, petting the dog.  Now if you knew the history between the dog and my hubby,  you would know how significant this is.    While I was gone, my boys were playing baseball in the yard, and son #4 was at bat, he swung and accidentally hit the dog in the head.  full swing, major hit.  Scrufty, the dog, immediately fell tothe ground, jerking, then suddenly hops up runing incircles, not being able to see.  Tommy ran to him, and got him settled down.  He can see now, and has been running and walking outside with the boys. He has thrown up twice though.  I called the vet, of course they want to see him, but it is after hours, and will cost more than we paid for our last car.  Literally.  SO, we are having to watch him closely at home.    Son #4 is my quiet one, the sensitive one, the shy one, and it is killing him that he hurt the dog.  We are praying the dog doesnt' die because it will greatly disturb son #4.     Scrufty is sleeping now.  a quiet sleep.  I just hope he wakes up "normal".
