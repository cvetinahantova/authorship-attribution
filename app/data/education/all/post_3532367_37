Paul took to trying to ring Sandra on her mobile this afternoon. She ignored the calls but got all the messages! In the end she sent a text to Jill, who didn't realise Paul had been in contact again. The girls seem more settled at the moment, so it may have broken the ice, although Sandra says they will never be friends again.
