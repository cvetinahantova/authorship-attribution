Sometimes going to the dentist can be so nerve raking, like did I floss enough or did I brush enough that they can tell? It's just funny that it is a normal procedure for the doctor and person who actually cleans your teeth but for the person getting a cleaning it's a little scary cuz you are waiting to hear you didn't floss enough or you have gingivitus. My problem is that every time I floss my gums bleed like crazy and I have the reddest gums imaginable. My dentist says it's because I am on lots of medication because of my arthritis. But it was all good even though I lost a lot of blood my teeth are in great condition. Only thing I need is to get an electric toothbrush.  I went to my grandma's with Andre after our cleanings to have lunch and see my grandma's new puppy. They named her Chula, and she is the tiniest dog I have ever seen. She is a polmeranian so she looks like a little fur ball. All she does is sleep and pee it seems like, oh and bite your toes. I was trying to take a picture of her sleeping but she got up and I was on the ground, I didn't get up fast enough because she was doing her business on the tile. My grandma was like "Cela you know she goes outside as soon as she gets up!" I was like "I'm sorry I can't get up off the ground fast I am made of metal." hee hee. My grandma's lunch was awesome today we had spaghetti, tuna casserole, salad, and Hawaiian chicken. After we ate all that Grandma brought out the icecream with strawberries, she and Andre had watermelon. What a feast! She told me after we eat that we were going to go to Osco to look for electric toothbrushes because she used to work there and she could get a discount for me. We found one but I couldn't believe how expensive they were almost a hundred dollars! We got ours for 60 with her discount, it's nice to have people who know people.
