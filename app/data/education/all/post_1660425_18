The question is will you take your personal PC to school.  My answer is no.  I already use my school computer and home computer in conjunction with each other by emailing documents home and to school.  I also have a school laptop that I can take home if necessary.  This portability allows me to "work on the go" and be productive on those bus trips and during commercials of my favorite TV show.  Will students start taking personal computers to school.  The answer is two fold.  Yes, students will start taking PCs to school for personal use.  The problem lies within the use of the computer.  For example, palm pilots are currently not allowed in most schools because of the inappropriate uses that have occurred with them such as changing tv channels and beaming messages.  The same problem lies in the use of PCs in school.  They could be used for personal entertainment such as games, web sufing, or other "fun" stuff.  Some schools have set up a system where the school checks out laptop computers to students to use for educational use.  They can set up these computers to be "game free" and be more educationally sound.  I think the PC will be integrated more and more into the classroom as technology advances and teachers receive more training.  I believe that we are still some years away from the student carrying his/her personal computer to school.
