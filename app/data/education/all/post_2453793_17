should i move out or not?  maybe i'll give it a little while longer.  if this situation doesn't get better though, i have to get out.  i really don't need the verbal abuse and to be "looked down" at because i'm a girl...especially from my 3 closest friends.  if they really cared about me i think that they would treat me a little better.  tonight i told the boys that i was apartment searching.  i can't really tell if they care or not.  i don't think that even if they did care they would admit it.  i really don't want to leave, but i hate coming home happy and then within a half an hour of being around them feeling completely miserable.  i have a right to be happy, and no one should be able to ruin that for me.  i really hope the situation gets better...  okay...starting tomorrow i will start writing in my blog the way i want to be.  this isn't supposed to be a life story and drag on like this, so it will stop.  it's just so easy to write about my problems because that is what's on my mind.  plus, i'm lacking friends to talk to, so this blog is taking the place of a friend that would lend an ear.  it wouldn't bother me as much if i wasn't so damn boring and dry.  i apologize to anyone who reads any of this.  from now until then...
