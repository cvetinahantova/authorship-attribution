I was hanging out with my cousin this week it was fun, she absolutely adores me it's crazy. So it meant the world to her that we were doing something together. I am kind of sad because she has a lot of problems like she has a bad arm she had a couple of surgeries on her foot but no one knows what is the cause her family keeps it hush hush. She used to cut herself too but she is on prozac so she doesn't do that anymore. So she loves to play Scrabble but when she plays me she always wants me to win so she does everything in her power to make sure I win, like if she knows that the word will get her a big score she will put down a two letter word just so I can be happy when I win. Well I am not going to be happy because I don't like it when people don't play for reals and I don't have to win all the time to be happy, it is nice of her though to think that way she has such a good heart. I invited her to college group since she is 23, but she can't get a ride she doesn't have her license yet because she's scared to drive. She was asking me all these questions about the music I listen to and what our college group does, so soon she will be getting her permit then her license so maybe she can come and hang out. What was interesting to me was that she had just had a foot surgery like a month ago and she still had her stitches it felt like degavoo for me because I had just been there, like I was seeing what it is like on the other end of the stick. I was the one to help walk and what not, I was the one who had to be sure not to walk too fast because I was going to wear her out. I just want to say for those who put up with me during those times thanks. If you can please pray for my cousin she is so awesome and I love her so much but she needs to find God's love too.
