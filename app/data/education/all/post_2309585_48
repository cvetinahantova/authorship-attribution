Oh, I thank the good Lord above that it's Friday. Now to concentrate on everything I gotta get done over the weekend...  -- finish master scene analysis for  The Glass Menagerie  -- work on the house staff for tonight's performance of  Love Letters  -- do a beat analysis for the scene from  A Doll's House  -- rehearsals for  The Boys Next Door  -- pre-production work for  The Ties That Bind  (they asked me to direct) -- read  'Night, Mother   ...and that's just the theater work. I still have to pay bills and what not. I'm sooooo thankful for spring break coming up soon.  I think I may skip Shakespeare class Monday night, so I can go to auditions for  Ties That Bind . Otherwise, they'll cast it for me, and I'll take who they give me. Not that I have a problem with that, but I would like to know who's showing up.  ::points above to birthday countdown:: Not much longer to go! Get me a good present! :)
