Hello.  Good morning!  I had an awesome time at the movie last night.  I have to compliment Barbie.  You did an awesome job.  I think you should be the leader for the girls.  Maybe they can tell you when they are free and want to do something and if they can go somewhere, you can be the one to let me know.  No... but ya, great time and it was also interesting cause I guess the theater had computer problems going on.  I also saw Aaron Wonderly who was in the same movie with us.  Saw Isabel at the theater too but most people here probably knew she was going to a movie.  I loved the movie.  It was nice seeing everyone especially Barbie, who I think I hadn't seen since school was out.
