there are some days that are just too wierd, even for me.  kaninang umaga, i felt as if i was on top of things - handle ko ang lahat ng bagay, alam ko ang nangyayari.  i felt that i was ready to take on anything.  but then the afternoon came and all that energy just faded away.  feeling ko para akong na-drain intellectually, emotionally, psychologically, and all -ally things that there are.    i feel so fucked up, di ko feel magtrabaho.  feel kong ibato na lang ang lahat and just go home.  putang-ina, talk about being fucked up with work.  di na ito dala ng weather this time.  probably, dala ito ng mga people around me that i meet.  wala akong maasahan sa kanila.  or then again, it could just be me.
