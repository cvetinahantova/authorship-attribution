Well today I decided to be a good parent and go to the annual Govenors Report to Parents at my children's school. I was reluctant to go because normally you just sit around and listen to them whittle on and then go home, but today they decided to get parents to go that they would let you look at your children's work. I told the kids that I didn't feel up to it this morning, but then after running a huge guilt complex all day I decided that I really should make the effort. So I turned up smack on 2.30 when it was due to commence, and as I thought, we sat and listened to them go on for a bit and that was about it. I'm kinda glad I did go in a way because only about 4 other parents turned up. Consequently I was at school until nearly 4pm because I had to go over both the childrens work (quite meticulously) lol. This kinda made up for the morning I had. I have desperately been trying to get my hands on my form MATB1 (certificate of pregnancy) for the last week. I need to have it for my employers by the time I reach 25 weeks or I will loose my Maternity Pay. Also my husband needs it by 25 weeks so that he can register his intention to take paternity leave. My Midwide EVENTUALLY decided to get back to me today to tell me that I couldn't have it until I had reached 28 weeks. WHY??????? So I spent most of the morning chasing my tail, trying to find out what to do next from my employer, my doctor and the Maternity Alliance. Why is nothing every straight forward???? Well I suppose today could have been worse....... it could have been Monday!!!
