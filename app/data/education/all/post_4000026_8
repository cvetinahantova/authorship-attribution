For the second time in my life, I sleep for a perfect 14 hours. Since mid-night till this after at 2. Well so obviously I missed school which I am not really happy about but I had really bad sore eyes this morning, so yeah my weekend's extended. Not going to school today  might get some friends in trouble though, one- the results for last week's campaign, I have'em and they are suppose to be up by today! Two- Haslinda might be bored since I ain't there to let her pinch me all the time, hey wait...wickkkeeeddd... Lol. Well thats about it I reckon. Anyway now I'm dead bored and I'm gonna entertain myself with...whatever i can get to do. Peace out ya'll!
