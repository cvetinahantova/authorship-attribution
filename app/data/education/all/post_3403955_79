I was quite giddy at the thought the possibility of what this vist might be what it could be. And at first it was what I had hoped for and it was good. BUt then you pushed and pressed and I extended myself beyonf my bounds. I became very uncomfortable. I hoped that you would leave or that we would be able to create some common ground with which toi restart. The thing was that never happened and silence hung in the air like a never lifting fog weighed down by the expectations I had upheld. When you couldn't meet them the expectations became to great and the fogged dropped down upon us. I was so relieved when you left it was so freeing. The fog ran away and once again the day seemed bright. But now a new weight has settled upon my shoulders. This one is the question of what to do. DO I let you go or do I keep trying? I am not sure, I am not sure what I want and I am not sure what to do. I am hoping time will help clarify some of these misexpectations.
