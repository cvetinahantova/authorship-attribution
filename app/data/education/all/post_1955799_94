It's about that time to put the finishing touches on a few assignments, so I better get cracking again. Of course, I've been so busy with some things, like assembling a graduate portfolio.   It's one of those weeks where timee can be both friend and enemy.  Met with one of my instructors to view my portfolio.  She was impressed.  :-)  I'm glad I was able to get feedback from her.  I now have to create a resume proper.  Man, I'm going to be pooped from all the work.  LOL    Song of the Day:   "   Closer   "   by Tracie Spencer.  Why?  It's not that well known, and I doubt it even had airplay, but I love to hear it  it always reminds me of Christmas 1999, whene I worked for Disney.  Good memories, crazy times.  I was sober through all of it, I swear.  LOL
