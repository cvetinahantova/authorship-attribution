that's the theme lately... last weekend was "cats", tonight was "signs of love", which i'm confident none of you have heard of before =P  why?  because it's a play my pastor wrote for part of his Ph.D. 10 years ago, and it was fun.  tonight was the 3rd performance of 4 times that all the local churches were invited to and i'm glad i went.  basically he took the gospel of john and made it into a modern day parable... jesus and the disciples were instead a controversial rock band in L.A., judas was their money hungry manager... the feeding of the 5,000 with bread and fish became the feeding of the concert audience with chicken and biscuits; lazarus being raised from the dead happened in the middle of a hospital autopsy, etc.... full of puns and funniness, but also an interesting spin on things too, and not quite as cut and dry as the general scene descriptions i just wrote sound....  both pastor and his son (who helped produce the staging of it) acted in it, and both steve and scott (the two brothers in the family i'm always visiting) were in it too.  all in all, a thought-provoking and enjoyable evening... like i said, really glad i went. =)  plus, of course, since i was hanging out with church people for the evening i got lots of hugs -- that doesn't happen in math departments =P so yay for people too.  anyhow, now i'm just being a putz for the evening... night all.
