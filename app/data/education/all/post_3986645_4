Oh be-still my beating heart!   He  called me  by phone at 11:30!    He never calls!     EVER!    My life is complete now.       And why is it that the later hours of the evening bring out energy?        Tonight at dinner:       Dad: "Remember when I bought you that bird wing?"   Myself: [over a mouthful of corn] "Mmph."      Dad: "Do you know where that is?"              [upon leaving the table I saunter up to my room, find the owl wing, and place it on my dad's desk]      Dad: "I walked into my office and thought there was a dead rat on my desk!"   Myself: [smirk]       Alright.   It was amusing for  me .       I was just going to type out an irish-style song I made up in my mind about being perky and happy... but then realized you'd never get the jist.       I have a  very  large bug trying to fly around my desk lamp. In what manner will I take care of this matter? Get my dad to swat it to death. Huzzah!
