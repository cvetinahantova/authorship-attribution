Such a sad, intense story, very moving since he composed even though he was completely deaf...        urlLink Take the test , by  urlLink Emily .   Errr....  Anyway, I played scrabble today! Go me. I also sent in a proposal, which was eight pages long in a Word Document! I went to Target for supplies for the new semester. So, I'm all set. Tomorrow I have to go to 12:15 mass because Sunday School is right after that for some unknown reason. Other than that I've got nothing going on. Johnen called, but not much else happened. My life is so boring.
