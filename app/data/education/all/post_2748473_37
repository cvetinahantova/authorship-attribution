My doctor's visit was okay. I am told that most likely I will have to deal with all of my crazy mental crap for a long time, hopefully not my whole life, but who knows. I am starting to view it as something that I have to work past and a challenge to fight and keep fighting and will in turn make me stronger. I also notice myself starting to like a friend of mine, but I don't know what is up with that. I still have too many emotional attachments already and I don't want to mess up another friendship. Oh well, I will probably wait it out and be single and keep things on a strictly friends kinda level. Love you all very much.....................and I am forced to stop this entry for more school work....
