Yes, how many  Minnie Drivers  can there be? Not sure her voice is really original enough to make an impact, but I have heard worse. The problem is the songs. The title track and "Down" are okay, IMO, but her music is really lifeless and slowwwwwww.  There are four songs to sample from  urlLink Everything In My Pocket  on her site.
