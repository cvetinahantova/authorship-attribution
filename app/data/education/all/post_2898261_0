Dedicated to: JC, CL, AIAR, AMV, CA, DL, PD, AS, TM, RS and MY   The tender words are spoken each body and soul bared told secrets over endless days often doing more than dared.  New world beyond my door with intrigued and intensity since the sharing of our hearts bonds now make permanently.  Facing our days made easier despite any type of weather each others heart felt deeply all happy we stuck together.  Took us time and effort the bonding as strong as glue I now promise never to untie the bonds I've tied with you.  Understanding of each other knowing loving hearts care as a relationship interchanges these bonds will always be there.  To never leave on the outisde love entering each domain laughing, caring, and sharing forever friends we became.
