There is something glorious about the Blockbuster movie pass.  Such freedom in being able to choose what I want to watch and take it home with me with no obligation to return it the next day - I love it.  It works around my social life quite well since most of the time I enjoy watching movies alone.  I don't quite know why I enjoy solitude during that particular act since most of the time I do like to be amongst or at least near other people.  Even when I am reading or writing I would rather be in a coffee shop or at a park than at home.  I think I am an extroverted introvert or something like that.  Actually, since my trip I belive I have become more of an extrovert than I have ever been.  I've really see-sawed between the desire for seclusion and the urge to socialize and now I think I'm all about the social life.  I was able to be busy every evening last week and I loved it!  I just wanted to be around people, having a good time and talking and probably getting attention.  Maybe that is why I like it so much.  It is a way to feed my inner attention-seeking demon.  I think I like this more than I would usually care to admit, but I suppose it all makes sense when I think about how much I was on stage growing up.  I loved hamming it up and having all eyes on me and now that it is the summer and I'm not teaching and I don't have much opportunity to perform I believe I grasp it in the form of my crazy social life.  I sound messed up.  Maybe I am.  This is quite a theraputic thing to do - writing my ideas on the internet.  I quite like realizing new things about myself while I write and it is a strange thing to note that others could read this if they wanted and they could think whatever they wanted to think about me.  It is a bit like creating my own movie.  My life in bits and pieces scattered on the internet. . .
