My favorite tech host, Leo Laporte, no longer works at TechTv all thanks to Vulcan Ventures.  He was a huge lost.  He is the best and it will be hard to imagine TechTv without him.  It will be so sad.  It was hard enough when he left Techtv's The Screen Savers about 2 weeks ago on his own, but now Call for Help without him!!!  And this time it wasn't his choice.  They wanted to sign away all claims of some shares of stock or else he wouldn't have to worry about working for them.  He stood by his principles, way to go Leo.  But now He doesn't work at TechTv, but hopefully when TechTv and Comcast merge they will rehire him.  To read all about this in his own words on his website visit  urlLink  .  He helped to build up the channel to what it is today and this is how they repay him!!  Good luck Leo we will be cheering for you.  Your the best, no one can replace you or your humor.  I hope in the future that you can get your job back and we will try our best to help.  Until then you can still listen to Leo on his radio show on  urlLink   and visit his site at  urlLink Leoville.com .
