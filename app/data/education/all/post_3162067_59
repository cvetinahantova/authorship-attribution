I'm trying to have the world's most productive day today.  I'm typing up one of my rat stories, doing a cross stitch picture, playing with le ratons, sterelising the bathroom and kitchen, doing 2 washloads, hoovering and dusting and general cleaning and answering about 15 emails from my ex-pupils. A tenner says I'll pass out by 3pm!
