Last night we went to a v nice place for dinner. I felt a bit out of place because the bar downstairs was full of the beautiful young people shouting over their music, but the eating bit was much quieter and had exotic continental waiters. It was good. We had wine and coffee and proper whisky with ice.  Today we are up very early because we are going to the Land of Lego. Where Lego is king! Yes, you know, the funny little bricks. That stick together! LEGO!  I wonder if they have a whole section dedicated to 'fours'? Gra and I always used to run out of them. And Lego-man hands. There might be a well full of those.  I am v sleepy.
