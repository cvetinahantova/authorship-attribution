When I talk to you, I smile.You break me down in away very few have been able to break through or have tried. It scares me. I am not sure if it is you I am scared of or thought of you rejecting me that I am scared of. If I risk it, if I open myself up to you what will you do. I know on the outside I appear to be stong but inside I am easily broken fragile to the touch. The even scarier thing is if I risk it and you don't brek me with a rejection will our friendship with stand the shock? Is it worth risking our friendship? I risked it once before and was rejected, lost everything including part of my ability to trust and rely on people. I know you are not him. I know that you have a very gentle touch with matters of the heart. But can you take the amount of pressure I tend to place on others do you want to? or will you shoot me through the heart and kill me like a silver bullet going theough a werewolf? You stir something in me and I don't know what to do. Thousands miles away and my thoughts constantly drift to you. The way you know just what to say, How you can make me smile eveeryday, You reach for the stars and have a childlike presence about you, Is there anything you can't do?
