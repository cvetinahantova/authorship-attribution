I'm tired and really don't have much to type about.  I was in a really good mood today.  I think it was in part due to a good nights sleep.  I think I'll try and get to bed at a decent hour again.  I think I'm at the part in my book that gets cut out in the abridged version.  I'm 450 in with 1000 left to go.  Jeez what the hell could take up that many pages?  I don't know.  I'm pumped about eating some pork tomorrow with Fenton and crew.  I think other people might be downtown too and drinking might happen.  We'll see I guess.  Details on Seoul are still unclear.  I might post on them later or maybe not.  This Friday is my b-day so I'm pumped.  I can't believe I'll be 25.  That is just a little crazy.
