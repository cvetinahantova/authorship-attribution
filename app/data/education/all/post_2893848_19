Last night I proposed marriage to Kristin, and she said, "Yes."  We are engaged.    I suppose this is a venue for sharing thoughts with one another.  I haven't really had time for that, so I'll have to get back to the blog on the matter at a later date.  All I can think at present is: I love this woman.
