One thing I love about October is postseason baseball.  I think the reason for it is that the Braves are always in the playoffs, at least to start with.  Things are looking ok so far.  They split the series with the Cubs at home.  The next game is Friday at Chicago.  But the Braves are actually a better road team then a home team.  I guess that is why San Fran didn't want to bother making up a game on Monday.  SanFrandy I guess our teams are now more or less in the same boat.  I'm surprised at how well the Marlins have played.  Those crazy fish, can't count them out I guess.   Today I received an e-mail from Scott saying that my documents are on the way and he even gave me a tracking number to boot.  So as it stands I'm looking at being over there around Friday or Saturday.  While at the bookstore today I noticed a new South Korea book so I decided I'd check it out and see what they had about Daegu.  I was a little disappointed.  For the third biggest city in Korea you think they'd have a little more to write about, but I guess not.  I was hoping I could make this trip to Seoul this weekend but I guess not.  Happy B-day anyway Becky.  I'm sorry you seem so sad as of late.  Worry not, things will get better.  Because I have nothing more interesting to say, here is some trivia. 1) What is the largest amount of American currency one can hold and not have change for a dollar? 2) What famous medal depicts three naked men with their hands on each other's shoulders? 3) What was the first city to host the Summer Olympics in North America? 4) How many cities have hosted the Summer Olympics and what are they?
