I am taking (well, just finished taking) a class in Educational Policy Studies.  While these classes are always a thrill a minute and full of people who will spend their lives theorizing about education without having ever set foot in a classroom(where do you think No Child Left Behind came from?), this class had in it a bloke I found most irritating.  Here's the thing:  he didn't believe that things like tracking, biased testing, or racial stratification existed in schools.  It wasn't that he thought that these things weren't a problem, no he just didn't believe in them.  So obviously if he didn't believe in them, they must not exist and anyone who thinks that tracking and testing do exist must be stupid.  Yes, stupid.  This scintillating gentleman (who of course I had to be in a group with for the final project) actually called me stupid for believing in tracking and biased testing.  He thought it was ridiculous that I believed that members of the dominant (WASP) culture had an advantage over others.  He found it laughable that I believed that students who attend schools like New Trier (t.v. station that broadcasts to three different countries) had an advantage over students in places like East St. Louis (no toilet seats, not to mention textbooks).  I'm sure you can all understand my opinion on the matter at hand, so I won't bother to explain myself further except to say that it is people like this who are destroying education in the United States today!  It's no wonder that there is a teacher shortage!  Not only are (many) teachers grossly underpaid, but they are forced to work under legislature developed by "stupid" people like this boy in my class who have never set foot in a classroom!  How am I supposed to stay passionate about what I do when the reality is I will also have to follow the rules of "No Child Left Behind"?    Lots more to say on this, but it's late and I've still got papers to write!
