Too Cool for Pre-School   Fucking Hipsters.  Like it wasn't bad enough when they went after  urlLink teenage girls .   urlLink Now they want our babies too .  If a baby can be cool, then cool isn't as cool as I thought.  Why do I surround myself with these assholes?      Humanity is fucked.  I will dress my children in potato sacks until they are teenagers, at which point they will graduate to larger potato sacks.  They can wear whatever kind of underwear they like, though.  You've got to make some provisions for self-expression, and the way I see it, expression is purest without an audience.
