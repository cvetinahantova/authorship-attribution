Well, almost.  Jeez I haven't written in a LONG time.  sorry, guys.  I was at Open Court Training this week, and well, I have just been lazy.  Let's see how the year is going so far.  One kid has gotten suspended twice ALREADY  (it's now the 4th week of school)  Once because of defiance and the second time I heard he pants another student.  I wasn't there that day.  It happened this week.  My kids are doing horribly in math, and I think the biggest reason is because I haven't been there teaching them myself. They are not putting their personal numbers on their papers and boy will they get it tomorrow when I start handing out graded tests only to those who have their personal number on them.  I'll be throwing the others in the trash as I hand them out.  terrible I know but I think it's the only way they might get it.  I need to start them all over with writing.  I think we are going to do it together.  they will choose the topic as a class, and we will write it together.  I think its the only way I can do it. They have horrible writing skills and I hope to improve that this year.  also their spelling is horrendous and I can't think of a way to get them to spell correctly.    enough complaining.    I have back to school night on Tuesday, and I'm not really looking forward to it.  there's so much to discuss and not enough time.  unfortunately, these parents don't always "get it" in the parenting sense.    this weekend was pretty good.  I'm just so tired.  I wish I got to spend more time with Sean. He seems to just wants to hang around all day.  oh well.    I should really get to bed.  I gotta get up early tomorrow for work.
