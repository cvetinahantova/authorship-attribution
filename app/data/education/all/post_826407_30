Was a beautiful August morning as I walked to work today; warm and hazy.  I love this time of year, when things begin to change from Summery to Autumnal.  Its as though nature is putting on one last big show before things start to die and so puts out flowers and fruit extravagantly.  There are colours in abundance but even better are the fragrances of flowers and fruit which all mix together into a heady cocktail.  And always there is just the faint smell of decay.   Potent stuff.
