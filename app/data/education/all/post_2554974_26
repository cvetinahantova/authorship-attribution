----------------------------------------  My Dream.  --------------------- 2dae I had a dream abt my mother. While i was having fun at Shariffah's place, my uncle called me. He announced dat my mother just died. I was filled with anguish. Tears started trickling down. Visions of her started flashing through my mind. Visions of becoming an orphan was eminent. My head became heavy. I quickly rushed 2 e hospital she was in. Dere she lay lifeless. I regretted not treating her better when she was alive. I regretted dat she went away too soon dat i could not ask for forgiveness from her. I regretted dat i did not hug her or kiss her or cuddle up 2 her. I was petrified. Speechless and juz shocked. After e burial, I had 2 move on. Living w/o a mother. Living alone with my father and siblings. Alot of trouble arised. Alot of fights emerged. Well this goes 2 show that i need 2 improve on myself. Mayb diz is god's way of telling me, Treat my mother better. Mayb this is a sign that humans dun live long. Mayb this is a sign dat mothers are important. In short, girls are important in this Men's World. I love u mom.   Den in the shower, while waiting for e water 2 warm up, it had me thinking. Abt a girl. She has a boyfriend. And i'm like chasing her. It would be such a chaos in her life. Mayb i should juz leave her alone. Maybe i should juz give her space 2 breathe. Like wad i learnt from liking haswani, it doesn't mean dat if u like dat person, dat person muz like u back. I tink i'll juz leave her. If u love sumbody, juz let her go and if she wants u, she will return. Let fate do e toking. And if she doesn't want u, dere are still alot of ladies in e world. Dun lose hope.   Ok now i have 2 get ready.. Meeting Fairul soon.. ahh.. i hope i get 2 eat a gd breakfast..haha.. he's loaded 2dae!! yeah!! haha.. ok.. Chill out!
