May is a good month  Let me state that I know LOVE THIS MONTH! Not because I have exams at the end of it, but because LORD OF THE RINGS IS COMING OUT ON THE 25TH!!!! YAY! SO HAPPY! AND PETER PAN IS COMING OUT 5TH OF MAY! YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY! (more yaying for LOTR though).  Quote from "League of Extraoridnary Gentlemen": You've over exaggerating Mr Quartiman, and my hips are none of your business.."  I seem to be the only one that talks on this thing...oh well. I like talking to myself.
