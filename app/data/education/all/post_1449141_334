The success of welfare reform is a faith-based proposition in Washington, D.C. This month, as lawmakers debate the reauthorization of welfare legislation, the conservatives on Capitol Hill will offer their regular sermon on the virtues of 'personal responsibility,' ignoring the steady hemorrhage of jobs from the economy. And since welfare reform was a major legislative focus of President Clinton's 'New Democrats,' the other side of the aisle is unlikely to question the underlying belief that 'ending welfare as we knew it' represented a triumph in social policy.   Out in the real world, however, the jobless recovery and enfeebled social protections are increasingly set on a collision course. Local legislators must confront an ugly truth about their 'reformed' welfare systems: If critics charged that cutting welfare rolls had harmful impacts during the prosperous 1990s, the true extent of the damage is only emerging in the wake of the Bush recession.
