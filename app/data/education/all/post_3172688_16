Hi! Last night I was playing an online game that I'm addicted to now =/ and my mom comes in my room and asks what she can do to make me happy. I realized that in earlier posts that I said that I wasn't happy there at home (I'm at school right now) and I wouldn't reply. I know that she thinks that I meant that I was unhappy because of  her  when actually there are other reasons. It seems like my mom always says that we are directing our anger towards her, when in reality, I was just trying to blow off a little steam because my sister made me unhappy or something. But then I started thinking about other posts that she could have read. During my time of thinking she left for a little bit and came back in and asked, "Why can't you leave the house? We let you go everywhere, within reasoning, anyways." But I couldn't answer this one either because I know that she couldn't possibly understand how I feel. I mean she and dad depend on me to help my sister and my sister depends on me to help with the baby. I don't mind, of course, it’s just that I feel obligated to stay at home and help out. With the new baby, I can't just leave the house and leave everyone at home, waiting for me to return so they can ask me to do things for them. Sometimes I actually prefer to not leave because I know that if I do then I won’t want to come back. And when I do come back I will be in a bad mood because I am home. Anyways I got to go because the bell is going to ring, so Bye!
