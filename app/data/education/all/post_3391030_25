'We Are' by Kids in the Way We're on the edge of our youth, the days are getting long. It seems the times of our lives have all come and gone, but we know better. We've just begun. We are, we are, the kids in the way. You can't hold us down, oh no, you can't hold us down. This world it tells us what to do. It tells us who to be. They think their answers to this life will satisfy our needs. We are so different. We are another breed. There's nothing you can do or say, to make us choose another way. There's nothing you can do or say, to make us go away.
