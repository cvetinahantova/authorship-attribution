I have many memories of my brother.  He taught me so much and always challenged me to be more and do more than I thought possible.    I remember the sound of rain pounding on the tin roof of our farmhouse that signaled a day off from chores.  On those days,  George taught me about some of the classics through the game of "Authors" or we would read and make popcorn or cracker snacks.    I remember his 1st chemistry set and how he practiced what he learned on me and I remember how he loved card tricks and was always saying "pick a card".    I remember he always called me on my birthday even if he had to track me down in St. Louis or Casper, WY.    I will write more memories of George for his children and grandchildren  when I am less sad.  I thank God every day for his life and the love we shared.  I miss him so much.
