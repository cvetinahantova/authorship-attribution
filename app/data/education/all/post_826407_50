Seems that I spend all my life shouting at teenagers!  I realized I'd become teachery when on Wednesday I was talking with Helen and slipped into teacher mode to bellow "Just be quiet and listen to me"  Oops!  First Expression Celebration last night was fantastic.  About 45 people there which gave it a cozy feel.  I found the worship was ace, had a cool ambient feel to it- at times if you squinted you could pretend Zero 7 were leading worship.  I like the idea of worship being led by just a singer + musicians not a (usual male) singer/guitarist led band.  It gave a lot to it.    Rich talked about vision and where we're going about getting revelation from God, being in family relationship and being real with the world.    There were loads of people I didn't recognise which was cool and I talked to some lovely people.  We then went to the Hilsborough Hotel which must be the unexpected gem of the night.  A very nice Hotel Bar that is smart but humble feeling.  It has a Garden that overlooks the Ski Village (+ Mecca bingo) and a wide selection of special ales/beers.  There were enough of us there to bring down the tone of the place considerably.  Could be a tradition starting?     The whole evening felt like we were embarking on new journeys as a family.
