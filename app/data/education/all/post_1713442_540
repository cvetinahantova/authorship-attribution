urlLink Limitations of Current Language Testing Practices for Bilinguals. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Kester, Ellen Stubbe and Pena, Elizabeth D.  It looks at how the language testing of bilingual students is limited.  From the ERIC Digest:  Few diagnostic tools are designed explicitly for children who are exposed to two languages (Valdes & Figueroa, 1994). Current practices for assessment of language in bilinguals frequently involve the use of tests that are translated from English to the target language and/or tests designed for and normed on monolinguals. This Digest explains why these common approaches are not well suited for a bilingual population and provides guidance to test developers and administrators regarding more suitable approaches.
