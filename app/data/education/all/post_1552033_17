Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!     Things are not going well today.  Just for starters, I dropped by my blog today to discover that the Javascript connected to the free comment system provided by  urlLink Documentroot.com  had locked up my blog.  Why?  Because for some reason the  urlLink Documentroot.com  server is down.  The only way I could find to fix the problem was to remove the comment box link.  I suppose if I knew Javascript I could write a short error-checking script to compensate for this kind of problem, but if I knew Javascript I wouldn't have needed to rely on  urlLink Documentroot.com  in the first place!  I'll probably still use them once the server goes back online, but I really hate it when this kind of thing happens!  So anyway, I finally get that cleared up, and then I write a nice little post hailing  urlLink mad wench in the attic  and  urlLink Carved in Silicon  as two of my favorite reads, but I hit the wrong button and the post vanished instead of being published.  On top of everything else, it's pouring down rain in Tokyo.  Yesterday I had to take   four   fifteen-minute bicycle rides in the pouring rain in order to get back and forth to work.  Today, I will eventually have to take two more just to do my weekly shopping.  It will still be raining tomorrow, so in order to see  urlLink Hero   I will have to ride my bike back and forth to the train station in pouring rain yet again!   Farmers might need the rain but I certainly  don't !  On days like this I feel like hibernating.   I know!  I know!    Nothing   hibernates in summer.
