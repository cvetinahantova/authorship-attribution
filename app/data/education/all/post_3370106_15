Just as we take a step toward freedom, some of us turn and run as fast as we can from it, and that is exactly what I have done.  As much as I want freedom, connection, love, companionship, I ran away from it all because I let fear stand in my way, I let shame stand in my way, I let regret of the past stand in my way.  But today is a new day!  I can breathe the chill morning air again, I can stretch and gain energy from each breath, from each step, from each chant.  I can lift my eyes into the light again and ask for the help that only divine energy can give.  Why would anyone turn away from that joy?  Why would I make myself work so hard to bring that joy from within to all my relationships and situations outside?  Well, that just seems to be the way.  Yes, I continue to work on simplifying and clarifying, continuing to attune myself to the ray and things will get easier, maybe even seem natural.  I don't know.  They seem natural this morning.  Everything is the same as it ever was, but everything has changed.
