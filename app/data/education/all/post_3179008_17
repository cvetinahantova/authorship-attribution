The groove may have been found for the moment. It seems to be best to work moment to moment around here. Things have been running more smoothly, and I have resolved to approach things a little differently. It may be working out. I have been stepping back out of the process, leaving my power at the door.  One of the students wants to leave the school the moment he gets here. He always shows up early to let the staff know. He spends the early morning trying to get into the class, and all the rest of the school time trying to get out of the class. Yesterday he hurled an apple at the wall of the school. It exploded, and showered other student with juice and bits. Today he is antagonizing a younger classmate. He actually postured toward him, like he was going to hit him. This student is 16 years old, and the younger one is 9 years old. The problem with this student is that he wants to go home, and we ant to send him home. Therapeutic stand point: home is not a good option. Juggling this act is not fun.   More next week. Staff gathering tonight, should be fun and interesting. Adios.
