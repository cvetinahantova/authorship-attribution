urlLink    This amazingly rich barn sits beside Route 9 in Livingston, NY. As far as I know, it's not in use, but it sure does add to the atmosphere of the Hudson Valley. I touched it up a bit (the bottom left door and the windows have different effects than the siding). The velvety mocha siding speaks volumes and adds to the antique feel of the place.
