Before I forget, I will not be posting anything for the week that I am in Seattle, since I won't have any internet access.  I leave on Saturday and will be there until I go to mom's house on August 13.  I am going to go to Boise for 4 days or so between August 13 and 20, so if anyone has days they would like to get together while I am there, or certain days that they can't, please drop me an email and let me know so that I can try to work around people's schedules.  If you aren't sure if I have your phone number, send me that too.    For those of you who have left Idaho, I am sorry, but that was your own bad move.  You will have to come to me.   I will probably post one more time before I leave.  Otherwise, happy blogging.
