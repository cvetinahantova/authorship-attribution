Last Wednesday I had the first of the enkais and it was quite a lovely evening.  We had dinner at Blair Marina in Shiogama. It is a nice restaurant with a great view of Shiogama Port and the teachers I was with are all great. While there are positive and negative aspects of my year in Japan, I am definitely lucky to have experienced this year with the teachers at Shiogama Boys because they are a huge part of what will make saying goodbye a bit difficult.  I was really surpised when they gave me a really pretty Japanese fan and a traditional red scarf as a going away present.  Now I must think of something adequate to give all of them as a way of saying thanks, but it is hard to think of something that can express just how much thanks I owe them. I am really looking forward to this Wednesday when I have my enkai with all of the teachers from Shiogama Boys.  It should be another great night!
