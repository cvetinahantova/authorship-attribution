God'll take care of the rest.   sometimes i feel so misunderstood and unloved. no one even wants to take the time to get to know me. what is there to know about me? why do i think i should be loved? what am i worth? the blood on the cross? of course, but it's not by my blood, but the blood that covers me. because of Him i will get through my hurt heart and persevere.  ONLY by His grace and mercy, Gill
