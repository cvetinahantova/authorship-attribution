urlLink    Lake Superior is my favorite of the great lakes, although Lake Michigan is a close second.  It is cold and crystal clear, big, strong, dramatic, and sparkling turquoise BLUE.  It was there I learned to enjoy snorkling in order to be able to get a good look at the beautiful rounded rocks beneathe it's surface.  Swimming in July and August is cold, but not impossible.
