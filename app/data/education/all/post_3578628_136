It was brought to my attention that when we got back from YoungLife camp, you weren't happy with me at all.  You found my personality to be different.  You found the way I was acting to be different.  You thought I was crazy.  You weren't happy that I invited Demi without you knowing.  You became extremely frustrated when I attacked you and your family on the night I tried to get you to go see Spider Man 2 with me.  You became concerned that I was watching the Daily Show and actually agreeing with some of things the show said.  To add onto that, you thought that to be strange because you think the show is funny but doesn't reflect things that are actually happening.  You don't like my admiration for Michael Moore.  You wonder why I attack Bush because he's our president and we should respect him.    I didn't get this information from anyone.  I figured it out.  If any of this isn't true, please tell me.  But I think I've covered everything that might have caused your irritation with me.
