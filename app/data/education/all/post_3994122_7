so i spent 2 hours this morning trying to configure my computer to work at school.  it took the non-english speaking computer whiz all of 5 seconds...oh sweet technology, what a demented common language. glad i can quit pulling my hair out now.  especially since i'm already losing it like crazy.  i read about it in all the culture shock articles but didn't expect it'd be so pronounced.  my hair is falling out in clumps...as if i came down with leukemia upon entering the country.  to allay your fears, it doesn't look like female pattern baldness yet. how bizarre.
