Been very lazy.  Here is yesterday's entry:  Co-worker still sick.  She has the flu B-A-D.  No offense to her, but I hope she stays home.  I don't want what she's got.  LOL.  Don't need it either.  I do hope she gets better, and has a swift recovery-just at her home.   I was late for class this moning.  I was doing fine until I turned on my TV while getting dressed.  I hadn't peeped Rikki Lake in ages, but I did today.  A guest called her "Jenny."  Was that a faux pas or what?  I laughed and laughed and laughed.  I didn't get dressed.  I left home, got into some so-so traffic, and barely made it to class with about 20 seconds or so to spare.  I was psoitive I wasn't going to get a computer to use comming in so late.  That'll learn me.    Finished my project.  I'm proud of that.  Library's busy again.  I'm taking a break for some food.
