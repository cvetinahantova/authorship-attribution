this is my new online 'diary'.  i don't think very many ppl will read this so i can write the exact truth.. i hope.  Last night my mom and i had a fight.  I always want to kno stuff so i ask her why (eg. why can't i have a friend stay the night tonight) and she think's its offensive.  I don't get it. she also doesn't trust me. We painted my room last night so i had to sleep downstairs in the den. So when it was midnight my mom came in and took the computer and the  remote. even though i was going to sleep! it is so dumb.           I'm going to philedelphia on thurs with my dad, i'll be really bored i'm sure.  My dad will be gone at something so andrew and i will be in the hotel all day till nighttime.
