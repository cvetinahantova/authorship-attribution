i've been feeling unnerved about blogging about my faith journey because of the ads that keep popping up above.   i just want to clarify.  *i hate those things!*  so while i'm avoiding grading i ran into  urlLink a blog written by Douglas Rushkoff  -- if you know me, you've very likely heard me talk about him in the context of Generation X &  urlLink Merchants of Cool .  But his ideas -- particularly his big idea -- that we can take religion as an answer or as a question -- really resonated with me. (and it resonates because i like his answer -- that religion functions better as a question than as an answer.)  I percieve this to be  a parallel conversation with the whole  urlLink redemptive movement  thing that  urlLink Webb  articulates -- but in many ways I like Rushkoff's way of dealing with these questions better.   Webb, it seems to me, does a good job talking about some of the underlying issues in a way that committed modernists will *get* and enjoy -- but ultimately his method feels equally rigid to me.  and -- of course -- i think that webb completely gets the homosexual questions wrong --  i do, just in case you care, dislike how Rushkoff is always featuring the discontinuity (ultimately) with Judaism / Religion.  He uses the metaphor of dreaming and waking --   "It's time we wake up from the stories we've been telling ourselves and invent a new one."  and to me, these statement is fraught with a kind of platonic-cave-meets-the-manifest-destiny mythology.  and it misses all of the (much better) nuances implicit in the metaphor of "telling stories" -- specifically that stories are all rooted in structures, exploring and exploiting genres, reinforcing mythology...i could go on, but....  i really should ready myself for class...
