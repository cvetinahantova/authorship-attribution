Not completely, but some.    Overall it was a good day, the boys had a great time inbetween tests, and played with the other kids.    Heath decided his mom needed to go and leave him with Angie.  He told her to go, and make sure she weft him wiff angie.  I was touched.    I dont see Seth, Colby and Heath as often as I would like, so for my 3 year old nephew to like me, and want mom to leave him with me.  I am special.  I am one of a very short list.  How proud that makes me.  Noah stayed home with Tommy, since it was his day off, but soon got bored without any brothers to play with, so he went to Savannah's.  When he got home, I was laying in bed, resting my aching head, and he came and surprised me.  (at least he thought he was) and said "guess where I was ALL DAY LONG" streaching out the words as long as he could.  He was so excited he had stayed with Nay and Savannah all day without any brothers.  Such a big acheivement for him.
