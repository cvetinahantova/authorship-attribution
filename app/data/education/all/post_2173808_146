Just got this comment:   Here, here!  Iowans are nice people. I know quite a few. But the only reason I know them is becasue they are all exiles. New York, DC and even Clinton NY are peppered with former farm hands. They all say they love the place, well then why the hell did you all leave?  Plus - this is one east coast elitest who is horrified that following September 11th 180 Billion dollars was doled out to mid-western farmers while New York City had to beg to get a third of that amount.  Look if you can't make money farming then DON'T KEEP FARMING. I don't expect the government to subsidize my career in marketing. Only someone who is incredibly arrogant would think they deserve to be paid to keep a failing business running.  Some one like a smug Mid-western farming elite...   We left because there were no jobs.  And it isn't just Iowa farmers (though there aren't many of them left and those that remain don't get most of the subsidies) who feed at the trough of public subsidies.  Where would higher education be without public subsidies?  For that matter, where would any of us be?  And of course Iowans are not perfect,  but who do you trust to make decisions in a democracy?  Iowans or reporters from the Washington Post?
