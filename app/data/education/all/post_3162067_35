Somehow I did manage to get some work done yesterday, but it wasn't easy. It's so nice to have that first day back after the weekend under my belt: I feel like I can relax now. Horrible incident at work today as we were driving out for a cigarette. A group of year 11 boys shouted at Flo "french c*nt." Obviously this was due to the football yesterday, but it sickened me. Flo tried to brush it off, but I couldn't. These kids are monstrous and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. I reported the incident to Ian, SMT...he was as disgusted as I was. I still feel angry for her. She's my friend and racism is sick and wrong. Other than that, things were ok. I am so looking forward to not being a teacher, particularly to my bottom set year 10's and 7's.  I had one of my agencies contact me today with details of a job. I said go for it. Fingers crossed (good pay!).
