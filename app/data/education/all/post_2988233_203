Before I discovered blogger, I spent an unusual amount of time on Ebay.  I love Ebay, especially when I can manage a good deal on things.    SO today, I set up a new seller's account.  I have tons of books to sell, I had thought of donating them to GOodwill, but I need $$$$to buy homeschool books for this next year.  I am WAAAYYYYY behind of getting books bought, but we have been so broke, I haven't been able to do anything about it.  SO now, I am selling  books to buy books!  Let's just hope I make a killing at it!
