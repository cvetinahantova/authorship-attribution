Dave left for his family's Alaskan cruise this morning.  I took him to the airport at 4:30am - too early for me!  The funny part about that though is the phone call I got about 30 minutes after I dropped him off.  It was Dave and he said, "You won't believe what I did"... I said, "What?"  (thinking oh no, he must have forgotten something)... he said, "My flight was supposed to leave from Love Field, not DFW."  This is coming from a newly hired pilot, airplane lover, who knows TONS about airports and flying, and he is super organized.  I felt so bad for him, but it was just so funny.  Well it turns out he was able to get on a flight from DFW around the same time but wow... poor Dave.  I'm just glad he was able to get a flight there and then head on to California on time.    From what I understand, Dave was able to tour San Fransisco because he got there so early.  He sounded like he had a great time from the message he left me.  He also called to say that he was ON THE BOAT at one point.  He is going on a  urlLink Crystal Cruise  because his dad works for them.  I was excited to see that I will be able to see a view from his ship every once and awhile on it's  urlLink webcam .  I will keep you updated and in about 12 days I bet that Dave will have quite a lot to say about his trip in his blog.
