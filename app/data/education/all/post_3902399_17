How much did you pay for that Starbucks non-fat double latte?  The big-time corporations like Sara Lee, and Nestle, make millions from coffee sales. Yet the coffee farmer who did all the back breaking work nets less than a dollar per pound. The farmers don’t make enough money to cover the bank loan let alone feed and educate their children. The poor farmers usually turn to growing coca bean to get out of debt.  The large corporations have continuously taken advantage of developing countries. Is it ethical for a corporation to pay less then a fair wage to developing countries?  Should we even be concern about a corporation’s activities overseas?
