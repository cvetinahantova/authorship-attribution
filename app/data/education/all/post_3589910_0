We're moving soon. Not too far from here anyways. Like... 3 blocks... Or two, I've never noticed. My prom is on the 30. Mom is right now making my dress. Hmm... I don't know why I'm writing now, I just felt like putting somethings here. I got my new Westlife's CD, Turnaround.  I mentioned we are moving. Well, the house we are moving, I like it, but it needs serious painting and decoration. I want to plant sunflower. I've always loved planting those, since I was 5. At 5 I had 3 sunflower which were obviously ay taller than I was. At 10 or so I had my own little sunflower garden, reason I felt from where they were planted and had my leg black for a week... Then yellow. ^-^; And Now I want one again, this time safer and more than always. I just love planting sunflower, they grow fast, they last, and they are beautiful.  Do you know the story of the sunflower? No? If you don't well. Apollo (beauty and sun Greek god) was in love with Clytie a beautiful maiden or water nymph.  Something happened that they were turned apart. And thus she died for love and is reborn as a sunflower forever facing her beloved. Apollo is one of my favorite mythology gods, he has many love stories. Its interesting. His first love was Daphne, who was an accidental love because he was struck by one of Cupid's arrows.   "The heart that has truly loved never forgets, But as truly loves on to the close; As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets The same look that she turned when he rose."
