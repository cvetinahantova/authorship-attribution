Well, here ends another week of school, and I must say, I'm glad to see it go- had my first lesson with Mrs. Rogers since  *the incident*  and she said all of one word to me in an entire hour, and it wasn't even an English word! It was the Buddhist word for no-self, anatta, and she only said it because she had to tell me what to work on. I'm not sure whether she was actually ignoring me, or whether she just had nothing to say to me- apparently(according to Rukia, who is  GREAT ) she gave me a "look" as I walked out the room. Ha! And today had to do some  actual  work in my free today cos I forgot to do my English homework! Me! Forget English homework! Just  look  at what Mrs. Rogers has done to me. *dies* Last night saw my third venture to WS1, this time accompanied by Laura, Alex, Sel and Zeb+Co.- Loz was there, and apparently-  apparently! - DRAPER likes me! Good. Grief. This is highly stressful, because I have noooo idea what to do. Everyone seems to hate him, and I feel kinda sorry for him, so it might seem a little like pity-dating, but he's a nice guy really...arg blerg ick can't cope with all these  men ! This all began when Laura told me DRAPER wasn't coming into Walsall last night-  Gutted! - And then everyone gave me a *look* and it all got very confusing- Zeb told Draper he'd broken my heart by not coming into town and now Loz and Cheese (???what???) have decided to make it their own personal challenge to get the two of us together. Help! But we'll see. If it's gonna happen, it will. From now on, I don't care what anyone thinks about me and him. I'm just gonna keep it to myself and do what I wanna do. *dies again*  Ceff x   This is because I can spell Konfusion with a *K* and I can like it...
