urlLink Time and Learning. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Bill Metzker.  It looks at the concept of time and how it realtes to learning.  From the ERIC Digest:  Since the National Commission on Time and Learning released Prisoners of Time in 1994, the use of time in school has come under increasing scrutiny. The academic day, stated the commission, ought to be reengineered to include fewer noninstructional activities and offer a minimum of 5.5 hours for core subject teaching and even more to meet enhanced state standards (Kane 1994).   Over the years, educators have sought to enhance learning time through such reforms as block scheduling and year-round schools. The 2001 No Child Left Behind Act envisions efficient use of time as an avenue for improving learning.   This Digest summarizes the relationship between time and learning and examines what states and districts across America are doing to make better use of time during the school day.
