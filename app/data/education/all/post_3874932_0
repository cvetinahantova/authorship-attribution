Once we get our analysis going just a bit, we can invite the snpp group to come to the website and comment (this requires changing the internal settings so that non-members can comment at the site).  Maybe they will, or maybe the won't, but I certainly would like to see a discussion of the competitive creativity theme.  We can also invite people in the field that watch the Simpsons perhaps to come in an comment as well (Al comes to mind).
