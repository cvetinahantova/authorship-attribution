Here are a couple of pictures from the Uesugi shrine, a moderately famous attraction in Yonezawa. Apparently the Uesugi clan brought great prosperity to the people of Yonezawa and are still highly revered by the locals. It was a bit late to go running around taking photos, but I didn't let common sense get in the way.  Note that even in the temple grounds, you can still score a refreshing beverage from one of the three(!) vending machines there.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
