How annoying.  I just lost a couple paragraphs when I did something (I don't know what) on the keyboard.  Back to what I was saying, paraphrased of course.  Yesterday was Opening Day of baseball season.  I now know that because of my husband.  Until I met him, I would never have watched a game on TV much less gone to one in person.  But my husband's family is a big baseball family, and I don't just mean big fans.  His uncle played for the Yankees in the late 1930's and early 1940's (with Joe Dimaggio, Yogi Berra and Lou Gherig to name a few).  Bill's dad played for the Washington Senators and when the team moved to Texas he moved right along with them and went into the management end of things.  So when I first started dating Bill and his folks would tell stories (and they  love  to tell stories) it took me a while to catch on that Ted, who was so mad he stormed out of the hotel room and into a closet, was Ted  Williams .    Now I'm a baseball fan.  I can keep score and do it better than anyone else in his family (they never keep track of balls and strikes).  I also can tell you if it was a 6-4-3 or a 5-4-3 double play and know the seven ways to get on base.  Go figure.   Happy Birthday Baby Boy!  It's my little guy's birthday.  He's one and so cute.  I hope he has a great day.
