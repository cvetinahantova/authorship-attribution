Cokemaster and I saw  AVP  ( Alien vs Predator ) this afternoon. Not going to get into a major-league critique, but suffice it to say that the flick is a fanboy wet dream, incorporating all of the signature elements of both franchises. We both loved it. Good mindless action entertainment. 8 out of 10.  What bothered me... and I mean  seriously  bothered me about my theater experience today (besides the  six  commercials before the trailers)... were the four audience members sitting in front of us. Our fellow moviegoers included a dad (presumably), and his three children.  Little  children. Like 6,7, and 8 year children. A son (the oldest) and two tiny little daughters. Geez, Dad!  I understand the warped thinking that comes into play when the flick that you've been obsessing over for months finally comes out. I'm the guy who forced his girlfriend to stand in line for eight hours to see  Episode I -- on her nineteenth birthday. But this... geez!  Take your lil' ones to see  Princess Diaries 2--  not to see scary, drooling, sharp-fanged monsters ripping the guts out of one another and human bystanders (who are screaming "die, you motherfuckers!! all the while). Don't tell your little girl to be quiet when she's start whimpering "Daddy, I don't  liiiiike  this."   Superman III  gave me nightmares for weeks. I was older than your kids when I saw it! And crazy-old-woman-sucked-into-supercomputer was Malibu Barbie compared to the horrors they just endured. Geez!  And while I'm on this rant, movie theater should schedule one special screening of each movie each week... for "special" customers only. Moms and dads with newborn babies-- this is your show. Herds of punk-ass teenagers who must commentate on and ridicule everything on screen-- this is your show. Bellowing and spazzed-out retards-- this is your show.  Excuse me while I call the proper authorities.
