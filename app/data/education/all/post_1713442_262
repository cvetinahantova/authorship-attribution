urlLink Ajdee Internet Directory  This web directory has a plan for making money from site owners while still allowing non-profit sites a way in.  Commercial sites must pay $25 to be reviewed.  Non-profit sites only have to pay $1.  Why a dollar?  It keeps spam out.  Unethical web owners who are trying to get crap sites listed (or get the same site listed under different urls) probably will not give their credit card numbers and pay a dollar.  Most legit non-profit webmasters will.  The result means Ajdee can make money off of commercial sites and still give non-profit sites an avenue in without opening the doors to spam.    This is a great idea.  I hope Ajdee does well.  Yahoo, take note.  Maybe you can charge non-profit sites a nominal fee to get reviewed?  $299 is too steep when your site is not designed to generate income.  Those non-profit sites are usually what your searchers want anyway.
