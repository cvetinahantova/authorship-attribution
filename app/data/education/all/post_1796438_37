Here we go... again  Amazing. I don't post in something like 2 months, and here I am posting twice in two days. I never thought I'd see the day.  I'm in the process of inviting Teagan to join the website. I don't know why though... I don't want everyone to find out about the website because no one will bother posting. If I just invite some people then maybe we can get a little community going and get everyone interested first.  My sister's moving to Perth. Christy is in the process of selling the house in Grenough. Her, Dan, Allira and Isabella will temporarily be staying in Cannington (yes Morgan, I know how close they are to you) but plan to move to Leederville. I frankly don't approve. I think that Cannington is a perfect spot to stay. It's close to Curtin Uni and Morgan's house (well a lot closer than Leederville!), which means there's always the possibility of moving in with them when I go up to Perth, at least until I find a place of my own.  I was attacked with sillystring downtown today. Long story...  Speaking of stories, Mr Sharpe was telling us another educational story.   "There was this guy I knew in year 10 who was a few tim tams short of a pack. Anyway, this guy was starting to get interested in girls, but they wanted nothing to do with him. So this guy went downt he road to the house of this kid named Joe Vernon. Joe Vernon is now a dentist, so if you ever go to the dentist and he's there then leave because he's the cruelest man you could possibly imagine. Anyway, he told this guy thart the only way to make girls attracted to you is to make faces at them. So this poor kid went running up to all the girls he could see and made faces at them. *insert Mr Sharpe stupid making faces noises* The girls of course screamed and ran away from him. Poor guy. He kept making faces at them. He was a full-on Ed Support kid."
