Well, it's official -- I'm officially single again!  I went to court yesterday morning.  It took all of a 1/2 hour and then I headed off to the DMV to renew my driver's license and get the name changed on it.  That was more of a mess than court was!  But I got one of those new-fangled digital licenses that NJ is so proud of, even though everywhere else has had them for ages.  I actually like my picture.  I have a cute smile in it.   The buying the house process is going slowly but surely.  Talked for a while to my landlord yesterday about the loan and my different options.  Hopefully, it will all be done by the beginning of July and I can replace the carpets.  When it's all done, I will be relieved.    All right, I'd better get my butt moving today...
