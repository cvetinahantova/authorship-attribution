July 25, 2004:       Hey! I can't wait till tonight! We're (Mom, Lauren, and I) going to another Slingshot 57 concert! (Slingshot 57 is the most awesome Christian rock band ever!) Yay! I can't wait. Driver's ed was ok. I just hated leaving Lauren at home while I went driving. Oh well, that's over.                   I wonder if any of the other boardies (people on the Slingshot 57 message boards) will be at the concert tonight. By the way, the concert is at Christ United Methodist Church in Indianapolis. The cost is something like $5, but we'll have Mom with us.                                         *some time after that*      Yay! Mom's home. We'll be leaving in a few minutes. Oh I hope we get there all right.  Unfortunatly, we aren't very familiar with Indianapolis.  Oh well, God will get us through it.                     *after being in the car for 2 hours and 30 minutes*      Are we there yet? Where is this place?  We've done 3 U-turns so far.   Not to mention Mom just tried to get directions to the church at a Subway drive-thru!  Man, that was the so embarrassing, but it was also funny in a few ways. I wonder what they thought of us. *Gasp!* What is that?! Why is there bunches of blow-up things over there? Oh look! There's a sign! *girlish scream* It's the church!!!!! Woohoo! We made it!!!!!                                *during UN1ON's performance*      Good night! This is so boring! I came here for a rock show! NOT a RAP show. BOO! BOO! This is boring.                                 *forever after that or so it felt*      Woohoo! Are they done?! *guy says in a loud voice* We have 2 more songs to sing...      Ah man! When is Slingshot 57 going to get on?! Hey! What's Paul doing? Oh my Larry Smith! He's writing on Ben's white belt with a light blue sharpie... Ben's going to be so mad. Ben's belt has now been ruined by Paul. He wrote "Nash." ... uh oh! That was Ben's favorite white belt! Haha...          *finally, after UN1ON gets done and Slingshot 57 is on-stage*      Woo! This rocks! "Kick off your shoes and stay awhile, welcome to my head..." Ben has such a wonderful voice. They all rock! Man, God is so awesome. He was so smart in making these awesome 5 guys. Wowness!                                         *next song... or not?*      Nash was supposed to be starting the song... oops! Oh well, no one's perfect. Oh... Nick played a beat on his drums that made Paul dance. Do it again!!!!! Please?! Ah man! That's not fair. Oh well, maybe at the next concert.                               *after the show, talking to the guys*      "Sarah, you should go by 'SBD.' That way we can call you 'Silent But Deadly.' After all, you don't talk much in person," said Ben and Paul agreeing to torture me with my name as long as we live.                                              *to the present*      Well, we got home much easier than we did going there. Now, I sign off as "Silent." So I don't fully allow people to make fun of me. My theory on that is "Silent" for I don't talk much in person, "But Deadly" for my extreme craziness with silly string and on the message boards. After all, I am the top #1 poster on there.      Another thing, tonight (Friday, August 20, 2004) I'm going to another Slingshot 57 concert. This time it's in Corydon at the Lincoln Hills Christian Church. It starts at 7 pm (6 pm Central). It's $5 to get in this time. Hopefully, this time we don't have to go through a Subway drive-thru to get there!  Silent
