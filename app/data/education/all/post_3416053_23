A  urlLink link .  While this is an interesting idea I think there are some big holes in it.    1.  The tax will be regressive and affect poor people the most.  Likewise it will cause a big increase in the price of things like food due to the cost of transportation.  2.  Many home-owners will end up having to rent.  People who live in the far suburbs won't be able to sell their house for enough money to move into the suddenly more valuable houses near their jobs.  3.  It will tighten the job market since people will be less willing to commute.  This could cause inflation as salaries are boosted.  4.  There is not a sufficient transportation infrastructure without the extensive use of cars and trucks...the economy would have severe dislocations.  5.  It is stupid to buy out idiots from their SUV's when there will be a lot bigger problems as a result of this policy.
