Musical Recommendation!!   I strongly recommend  Senses Fail . They are soooo cool!  Mp3.com defines them as Emo, but I don't like that word because it has no real definition. I'm sure I can make one up though... but it's really hard cos Emo ranges from Dashboard Confessional to Taking Back Sunday and those bands are really different...why am I whining about this??  Anyway Senses Fail are really good, they have an EP out on Drive Thru, go buy it they rule.  Don't buy: The Resignation by Rx Bandits if you like Ska. Biiiig disappointment. There are some moments of sheer brilliance (Pal-Treaux) which then irritatingly descend into self indulgent guitar scraping. Boo Hiss to them.  See you at the show Ceff x
