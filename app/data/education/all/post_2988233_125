Yay, Jasmine finally gotr voted out.  So who will win next week?????  I don't know, but I am pulling for Diana.  Fantasia will get signed by someone, somewhere, for a whole boat load of money.       I loved Tamyra's song Raindrops will fall.  It was so  beautiful.  She was really amazing tonight.   I have so much to catch up on, but need to get some sleep.  I will post a nice blog tomorrow, I promise.
