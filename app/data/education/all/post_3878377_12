Well I should have started my day by attending ordination and feast day of the Camillians but I prefered to stay home with Jorge.However, I have meeting with the new set of officers in the student council. Things went smoothly anyway. Martin and I are just nostalgic about leaving the SC, well perhaps it is natural to feel this way since we will miss a lot of things after our term.  Jorge drank so well last night,got a swollen lower eye (left side)and an eyeglass with a scratch!Perhaps alcohol do really affect the psychomotor stuff and proper body coordination of the person, eventualy loses his balance and fall on his knees, or face or fall upside down (whatever the position is)...stupid drunkard, why drink when you have to get in all those troubles! Oh men, I donot understand them fully..how can I?  While posting some things I met a friend from long time ago in ADZU, who else? Junti Castillo, he said he still study in La Salle, taking his MA in Econ..good for him.  I have a very exquisite day today!I thank God.  Jo
