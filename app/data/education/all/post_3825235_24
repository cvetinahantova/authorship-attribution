the best cousins picture I got at the reunionÂ  urlLink     urlLink     Yeah, so like I mentioned, our reunion was this weekend...So nice.  It was too cool!  But, can't you tell how tired the kids were?  Although it was a nice time to run and Chase Bears, and witness Poi, it took a major toll on them.  But, we will have pictures and memories to cherish for a lifetime...well, maybe not Coley and Lauren, but most of the others.  Really cool.  Yeah, this is boring, so I will get some sleep, and then be more interesting in the morning.  Miss me!
