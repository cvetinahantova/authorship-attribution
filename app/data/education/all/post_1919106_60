Random shtuff   Ok, in Airmaster it seems like the bouncy-bouncy chick has the hots for the fighting chick. I'll definitively have to watch more of that, if just for bouncy-bouncy's sake.  More Nyquil madness: We did the math, and a $3000/week Nyquil addiction it a lot of bottles... Hence comments like "Bottles! I see bottles everywhere" "Yeah, because the floor is littered with them!," and "Nyquil kegstand," and "Nyquil bong," and "Nyquil vaporizer." Yes, we are _that_ bored.
