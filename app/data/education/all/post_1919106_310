... The  urlLink bullshit  that the DOJ comes up with. My history teacher from high school used to have 2 sayings:  - Hazte la fama y echate a dormir. - No te duermas sobre los laureles.  The first one translates into "Get famous, then take a nap", and the second one to "Don't fall asleep on the laurels." They both had the same purpose: to remind us that we had to keep making an effort throughout the year actually be able to finish the course. But it also applies very well to the error that these pro-intellectual-copyright, anti-sharing fanatics represent. Because the trick is not to get a great idea and then sit on it. If you do, someone else will come up with the same idea through entirely different means, and then you're back in the gutter. Take a look at Google. They're doing quite well right now - but they know that they have to keep working to stay ahead. If you want to win the race, it's no good to try to keep everyone else in place. You actually have to move forward.
