Okay, so this past week I went on a mission trip and it really forced me to look at how much filth is in this world and how fast it is all dying. I want to be a less selfish person and try and take the things from this world away from me. I have no idea what I am doing next fall but I am starting not to care. I am but a mist and I am gonna prepare for it but not stress on it. I met a bunch of awesome people this week and have started to get on fire in my life again.     This world has nothing for me and this world has everything.
