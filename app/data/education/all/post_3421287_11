The electronic key to my car broke.  Not a big deal, except it also operates the immobiliser, and so I was stuck in Tesco's car park for 3 hours while the RAC man soldered it and stuck it back together as best he could, just to get my car going.  He advised me to get a replacement as soon as possible, so I phoned the manufacturer and tracked down a local dealer.  I had the number of the keypad, and I knew they'd be able to order a new one.  Off we go to a car radio specialist in town.    You know the kind of place - fits stereos that make the street shake as the car drives passed, as slowly as possible, for maximum pose effect.  A boy place.  I need a new one of these, I say, handing over the taped-up fob.  So he pulls the tape off, rips the guts out, and sticks it in a new casing.  Tries it on my car, and it doesn't work.   That's why I need a new one, says me.   The bloke grunts at me, and takes it out the back to his mate.  Mate arrives, points it at the car, and nothing.  Without the key-fob working, I can't use my car. Your unit's bust, he tells me.  Common fault on these, you'll need a new immobiliser.  But it was working fine when I came in!  Working fine until your mate pulled it to pieces!  Well, he said, we need the number... This number, I ask, handing him the paper I had it written on.  Off he goes and ten minutes later comes back with my electronic key, working fine.    I still ordered a new one, because I don't want to get stuck like that again, but I was angry.   I'm a girl, not an idiot, and when my unit packs up, I think I'll notice.
