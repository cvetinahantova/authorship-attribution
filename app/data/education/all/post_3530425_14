The ex's father got a boat.  A big one, for the river.  Bastard.  The paranoid side of myself just knows that the ex had a hand in this, so that he can be the cool parent, and prove that Mommy Sucks.  After all, my boat requires a 4-hour drive, and it doesn't even run.  Better believe that Grandpa's boat runs.  It probably cost him in the low 6-figures, if I know him.  Nothing but the best for the clan.  My paranoid self wonders:  what if Gabriel would rather be with daddy, the squeeze & squeeze's kids on Grandpa's Big Boat (can anyone say "small penis"?) than on mommy's hopelessly small, doesn't even run, 4-hour-drive boat.  Ames will remind me that Gabe loves me better, but MAYBE SHE'S WRONG.  It has been known to happen, though she'll never admit it. But I've know her for 22 years, and she HAS been wrong before.  Not often, but it does happen.  The first time Gabe tells me he doesn't want to go to Lake Cumberland with me, 'cause Dad's taking the others out on Grandpa's boat, MY HEAD WILL EXPLODE.
