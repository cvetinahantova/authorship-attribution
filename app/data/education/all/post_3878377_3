Today it pains me so much to say goodbye to Jorge. I was thinking time is fast approaching, eventually he has to go...but I have to be stronger. and I will be...  My heart aches..so much, I'm gonna miss him. I hope he undertands how much I feel for him. and what I am going through right now. As i try to understand what he is going through as well. I love him.
