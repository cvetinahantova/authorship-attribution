One more day until the holiday weekend is upon us.  I don’t know what it is I love about the fourth so much, but the combination of barbeque and fireworks just gets me all worked up.  No matter the reason, I look forward to spending the weekend in Florida with the in-laws.  Hopefully I can beat my father-in-law in go-carts this time around.  He races dirty, so I just have to race a bit dirtier!    Now for something completely off topic.  At the present, I am working on my mother’s coworker’s machine, which apparently had several hundred spy ware applications running on it.  Is there really anything one can do, besides the obvious tools to defend against this menace?  She has children who use the computer, so I think that must be a big cause to this widespread panic.  Kids will click on anything.  More than likely, there exists some piece of software that can be purchased or downloaded that prevents these from even being installed.  I know SpyBot has the immunize feature, however, I’m not too sure if it actually works.  Those programs seem to pick up the same pieces of spyware every time they run…just to give the good feeling that it is actually working hehe.
