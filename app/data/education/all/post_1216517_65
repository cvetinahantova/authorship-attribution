pop haiku fun  i went golfing. my ball hit many trees. i drove the cart fast. it was an enjoyable activity.  i had a birthday. now i am 23. i ate a piece of cake. it had a banana on it. it was a savory treat.  i went surfing. i rode the waves in spendor. i became red. my body hurt. i applied a soothing remedy.  i broke my car. it won't go anymore. now i have to pay lots of money. it is not a joyous occasion.
