urlLink Johnny Depp  as Willy Wonka? It could work. He does some really amazing mime stuff. I never really liked "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of my favorite books ever when I was little. The movie never did it justice. The focus switched to Wonka, and Charlie was not a hero. He was merely less rotten than the other kids. Why am I thinking about this? It's on AMC and we have it on in the background. The thing that really bugged me about it (and bugs me now) was that Rohld Dahl wrote these amazing poems for the oompa loompas to sing, and they rewrote them. And they sucked! I could go on, but I won't.  Last couple nights have been tough getting The Boy to sleep. It's weird how he'll go down easy most of the time, then we just hit a wall. Last night, there was much fussing and much eye-rubbing and crying ensued. Then there was an ENORMOUS poop and he went right to sleep once I changed his diaper. Today, no poop, just exhausted sobbing boy rubbing his eyes and crying. Eventually we gave up on the crib and now he's fast asleep in my bed. It's pretty tough because I usually don't make dinner until The Boy goes to sleep. But I'm usually really hungry when I get home from work. Whine Whine.  I'm whining tonight.
