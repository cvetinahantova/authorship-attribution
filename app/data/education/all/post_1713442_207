urlLink LEAPzine 2004 - The Online Newsletter about February 29  Happy Leap Day!  This day only comes around every four years so enjoy it.  I think that those who have to work on this day should get four times their normal salary.  I would'nt like to have a Leap Day birthday.  However, in the paper this morning, I read about a couple who are celebrating their 15th (actually 60th) wedding anniversary.  The man in that couple was wise.  He only has to worry about remembering their anniversary every four years.  The blogged site of the day has a variety of information, games, and items for sale relating to Leap Day.  It is a nice site but I imagine most of the traffic it gets only peaks every fourth year.
