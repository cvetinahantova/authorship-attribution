In Wisconsin people used to say there are four seasons:fall, winter, spring and construction.  Well, I will take construction and blue skies over this rainy stuff any day.  I have 15 minutes left until I leave school and the sky is not looking very promising.  The RAINY SEASON has begun and although we were very lucky over the weekend, I think when the rain comes down tonight it will be coming down for at least the next month!  And it isn't the cool refreshing rain...it is the warm constant drizzle with the oh so pleasant effects of humidity so a) you are never dry b) you are always sticky and c)upon your arrival at school and your departure at the end of the day, everyone says take care and wave from their windows as they drive past you, standing there in your rainsuit, holding an umbrella, and entirely drenched because the rain is unavoidable and it is so hot and sticky that even if it wasn't raining you would still be wet.  Sometimes I wonder why I even bother with a complete rain suit...But I am not complaining...in less than 2 months I will be escaping what is supposed to be the worst summer in 5 years here in Japan. And I am up north...all of the people down south are currently complaining because they believe hell is located in southern japan.
