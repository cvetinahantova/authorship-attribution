hello,  well i'm still at the lonely beach in koh chang.  we are having a great time  hanging out in our hut listening to the sound of the ocean.  it's really  wonderful here.  today we went up to a waterfall on the island.  it was  gorgeous.  it looked like something out of patagonia magazine.  anyway....  other than that not much to tell.  i hope eveyone is enjoying their summer.   i'm certainly loving thailand.  i've gotta run.  i promise i'll write a longer letter later.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ MSN Life Events gives you the tips and tools to handle the turning points in  your life. http://lifeevents.msn.com
