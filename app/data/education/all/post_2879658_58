Well everybody...it is official.  My ticket to return to the U.S. is booked and paid for.  I will be flying into Chicago and I plan to stay for a few days and will then continue on my journey home.  I can't believe I will be returning to the U.S. after about 353 days in Asia.  I have heard a lot of talk about reverse culture shock recently but right now I am just excited to be heading home!
