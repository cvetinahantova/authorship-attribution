I read and article from  urlLink Jessica , a local  urlLink Marie Claire  or  urlLink Cosmopolitan . It was about  urlLink 70 things women can do or must do before the age of 35 . I did the checklisting when I was reading it. I deleted some which I think are not applicable and 63 were left. See if I can finish what I set for myself before 35......
