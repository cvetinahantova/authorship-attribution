MY BIRTHDAY PARTY!       Well, as I had begun celebrating my birthday a week prior with my trip to Okinawa, I had to end it with something equally exciting.  My friend Jess and I decided we were going to have a joint birthday party hosted by our friend Dave (with a little help from Cory who lives next door and let people sleep at her place).   On Friday I met up with my usual crew and headed to Rifu.  Only about 10/15 minutes away by taxi but getting there on the train is quite a task.    Anyway, it was definitely a party to remember.  I don`t think I have ever had such an international birthday party and will probably never have one again.  Everywhere you turned there was a different accent.  There were English, Welsh, Scottish, New Zealanders, Australians, Americans, Canadians, Japanese, and probably a few other country representatives as well.  There were probably between 40-50 people there throughout the course of the evening and it was great because I got to celebrate with good friends as well as make lots of new ones.     When the party starts around 8:30 and you return to your apartment (with two friends spending the night) just before 3 AM...you know it was a good party!
