It's one am and I can't sleep so I decided to do what most insomniacs get up to these days and bugger around on the internet for an hour or so until my eyeballs turn red and I collapse in a fit of exhaustion.  I am now the proud owner of an SGH-E600 mobile phone.  What SGH-E600 stands for is anyone's guess.  However, I can tell you that my new handset is silver and shiny, slides easily into the pocket of my jeans and has a camera-attachment thingy.  Useful for taking drunken pictures down the pub.  Not that I'm allowed to get drunk these days, but no matter.  I'm tired.  My back and shoulders ache.  I've been feeling nauseous and shaky today, especially this afternoon and I'm worried that it might be these tablets that I've had to take for the past two months.  I feel sad.  I actually shed a tear earlier although why is anyone's guess.   I don't want to whinge (you're not whingeing).    I'm jealous of lovers in love.  I'm tired of not getting what I want.  I don't want to moan though. 'No-one likes a whinger...'  as my Nana said to me in a letter once.  She talked a lot about Uncle Alex and how he takes her shopping once a week but he doesn't have much patience for choosing nice apples and how the checkout girls these days just throw your things at you and they don't care what gets squashed or messed up in the process.   I'm being evasive aren't I?  Doesn't matter.  I'm going to bed because I could write more but I'll only end up telling myself that what I've written is rubbish thus reiterating my belief that my thoughts don't matter. Thoughts. Give you a penny for them if you can write them down fast enough.  Laconic.  There's a word I like the sound of.  That's what I'm being too.  The knotty ache in my stomach is getting worse which means that this is not resolving anything which means I'd best go to bed.
