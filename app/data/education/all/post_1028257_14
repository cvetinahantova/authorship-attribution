After Church on Sunday,we went out to eat, and shortly thereafter I went to visit my friend Rob Swingle in Wabash. On the way back home, I saw the usual stupid church sign on 1 of 2 churches that change thier's week to week.  Well, this one had me laughing for almost a half minute out loud!  Imagine my surprise when Stevan of  urlLink www.stevansheets.com  fame (so he says), passing through the area, also saw it, took a picture and put it on HIS blog! I was gonna go back and get a picture! He scooped me! Anyway...courtesy (without permission, but with credit given), here is the sign. See for yourself.     Later Addition:   Stevan Called me at work pretending to be some guy from this church, asking me to take the picture down off my site because they were suing Stevan! Imagine, a Church suing because of a sign! I fell for it, but it was because I haven't heard his voice in a while. Also, Being the nice guy he is, he helped me a little with the comments and layout of my blog. Now, if you click on the  comments  link under each post, you will see all of the other comments made so far. Thanks Stevan! Oh, and I am gonna start keeping my camera with me when I go by these signs...
