The last young person has left and I am now here on my own with just my  thoughts as company!  Now that it is final that I moving on, all I can do is look over the  past 2 years and think about all the highs and the very few lows.   I was really touched by what they did, i was given a card that was  really amazing (I am not an emotional guy but that made me feel  emotional) a little frame with the foot prints story on, wine and  chocolates.  They were all really grateful for what all the leaders have done for  them.  I am going to go now and contemplate about all that has happened in  this chapter.  Bye
