I've been to heaven n BACK...... WHAT haf I been up to the past 3 days???  SLEEP, SLEEP n LOTS of Beauty Sleep!!.... hehe...  Mr Zirk s, I tink, a bit pissed at the rate I'm going!!....       Saturday was a wonderful dae out to Bugis, 'Collateral' was such a bore even wif Tom Cruise in it.  DO NOT WATCH IT.  'Village' s scary but u'll curse the twisted ending... now 'Ella Enchanted' s a refreshing change.... I tink I'm just gonna stick to my happy movies for now!!  Dat reminds me, I crossed path wif a fellow chatter on e same day... n Mr Zirk said he just left his girl trailing behind just to catch up wif me.... hmm... Mr Zirk s so sensitive bout these things!... me n dat SOC guy just good fwens since 3 yrs back....  But everything ey ok.... wait till I upload the funny tings I made Mr zirk do.... like putting a long cup in his shirt pocket!....*am I cruel or wat!!*      Well... so many "sorries" to Sazymaera aka Helena for cancelling our dinner date... promise will make up to u next week k..... *u haf farewell dinner or sumthin tis friday rite?*        WHo's interested in Kickboxing? I'm willing to share some moves!.... yeah yeah.... so long s u entrust e future of your joints n limbs to me.... I do very e animated movements!... hehe....      On Sunday.... I hibernated.... so many many hours of sleep... woke up only at 2+ pm.... den a badminton session wif Mr Zirk for 2 hours.... my movements resemble a baby kitten who looks for the yarn of string n ends up tangled in the net...hehe.... Smashed n flicked till I lost my temper at my fiance who effortlessly ended all my feeds!!!! ARGHHHHHH....... *relax Nurul*.... well... e best man wins.... I tink I'm too competitive wen it comes to games.      On Monday.... I hibernated yet again... I wonder wat the rest of my frens did at home? Today we're supposed to jog... but being daft n sebarang person... I wore my cargo to meet Mr Zirk instead of my usual workout pants.... he banned me from running in those.  Wich in turn, made ME angry.  But alas, I saw his reasonings.... n we went home so I could change into my adidas.   I really HATE jogging! for many reasons such s feeling like air supply comes in short spurts.... like how my face turns crimson n overheated.... DEN comes staircase climbing sets! This time only 2 sets.  Cool coool!  Mr Zirk says I'm in better form.        Well those are my 3 days... full of activities... but when DO i get down (work tat is)... well tats left to be seen... maybe after tis I'm gonna get down to serious marking n planning.... I miss Mr Zirk... Wish him luck in his coming IPPTs.  I'll be training wif him though... S a fellow blogger did say in her blog, "firm up those thighs women!!"......Well well.... 0.5 kg of muscles per month is no mean feat!!      Have fun gals....like I say.... Stay fit n fun always!!!
