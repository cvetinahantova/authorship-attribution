Finally, our government has made a huge step towards stopping Bush from going too far into the narrow-minded conservative hole.  Gay marriage is alive, and I predict it will thrive!  I hope gay couples around the country continue to show us straight folks messing with marriage how it's really done.  Hurrah!    I have a renewed faith in our system, despite my cynical, cranky disposition regarding government.  This is definitely the first time an act of congress has made me smile, have more than a grim outlook on the future of the US government, and made me proud to be an American- particularly one who backs congress' decision. Today, congress actually represented me, my views, beliefs, hopes for the future of our country!  I'm nobody in particular, but they stood up for my values today.    True representation is possible.  I hope the world notices this act of congress, in addition to the Iraq war.  I will sleep well tonight; big brother is looking after us:)
