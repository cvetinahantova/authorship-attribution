So looks like boys night might be another night.  I think tonight will be dog soup night.  I hope it's good.  I'm a little worried that it's going to suck some ass.  I guess we'll find out.  After eating the dog there should be some craziness happening.  Time is ticking for several people so I think it's time to make the most of the time left.  I got some pretty good sleep last night so I think I'm good to go, depending on how dinner treats me.   Looking at these maps makes me realize how big the world really is.  There is a lot of green on my maps.  I'm thinking I'll knock 2 maybe 3 more countries.  Still I don't think that's going to make much of a difference on my map.   Why is it still so cold?  When will it get warm again?  I need some spring soon.   Certian things in Korea are really starting to get to me.  Namely the fact that everything looks the same.  For example check out all the apartment buildings.  While there might some small differences for the most part the have the same shape and colors.  To take it a step further all the apartments look the same.  All the walls have a very bland color and they all have the same floor.  I miss carpet.  Koreans don't decorate their apartments very much or very well either.  The streets pretty much all look the same too.  Everything is the same style you know.  Neon lights and the same assortment of restaurants, bars, stationary shops and markets.  You either live in a tall ass apartment building or you live in one of these little crappy houses that I live it.  I wish there was a little more diversity.   Enough is enough.  No fucking spell check.
