Well as I type, there are big arguments going on in the office about annual leave. It doesn't effect me directly as I booked mine earlier in the year, but I really feel for the guy who it does effect. The atmosphere at the moment is painfully tense and after having no sleep, its quite difficult to cope with. Unfortunately, "new" rules were brought in at the beginning of the year. The only problem is, no-one consulted us and they are only local (effecting only our department).
