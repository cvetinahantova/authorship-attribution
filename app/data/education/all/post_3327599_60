well today went a little better then yesterday! i didn't get hit.. which is a plus in my book. i went and got the dog.. i was supposed to see Chris but well it was some more excuses and blah blah crap. i told him to call me later if he felt the need, hopefully he knows i'm pissed (boys can be so dense sometimes). i still have his class ring so he kinda has to see me again eventually hehe.. maybe i'll let claire play with it.. moving on  i never really thought about ppl reading this because i didn't think anyone cared that much.. so seeing that Phil left a comment i guess that means i have to be careful about what i say on here about him.. i can't say how weird he his.. or anything like that.. nah i'm jk you're cool! and thanks for reading about my boring life lol. We went to see Starsky and Hutch tonight. it was an ok movie.. Owen Wilson is hott haha. he needs to do something about that nose tho.. what's with me and noses? is that some mental thing? oh well, i always knew i was special! we ran into Teri and Jacob at the theater and of course Teri used her secret girl talk to ask if Phil was my bf.. she whispered "is this the new bf?".. he totally didn't get it.. silly boys. she's such a dork lol. i just realized i didn't even say hi to Jacob.. or did i? i don't remember..   and an update on the stalker.. the new gf dumped him, the ex gf is pregnant (NOT ME!!).. and he wants to talk to me because i make him happy..
