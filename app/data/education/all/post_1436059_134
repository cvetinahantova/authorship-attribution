Please don't read if you dislike violence and unhappiness. Minor language.    Feeling:  Like crap. I'm incredibly pissed off at Keniesha and I'm full of remorse for Amanda, but there's nothing I can do anymore and it's all blown up in my face and I feel like crap that's been stepped on.  Thinking:  I'm gonna kill Keniesha.   Drinking:  Water...  Eating:  Nothing...I'm starving...  Listening to:  REM - Everybody Hurts.  Okay, this is it. I can't handle Keniesha anymore. She's a bloody pain in the ass and she's made me feel like I'm useless and that everyone hates me. Maybe that's true but it's not cool. It's not cool. I needed to handle it so I canceled and made a mistake with one of the only people who was my friend. I shouldn't have, and I'm sorry, but this bullshit Keniesha is pulling is killing me and I want her out of my life.  Keniesha is freakin bipolar and maybe she doesn't realize that what she does hurts people. I know I might have this problem too, but I'd never ever ruin someone's life the way she's tearing mine apart. Yeah, this seems overdramatized, but she's messing with my life as if she can't control hers. It's like hers has gone down the tubes so she's taking care of mine.  I'm going to avoid Keniesha at all costs. Like Kendra said, if we just cut her off at the knees she'll just get worse, we need to ignore her entirely. This crap has gone on long enough and I can't handle it anymore. Keniesha, leave me the hell alone!  --- The cats went to the vet yesterday:  Sundae needs to lose a few pounds, Charlotte is too skinny, needs to gain a few pounds, And, just to add to the rest of the crap of the day... General Posy is as old as I am and he might have some form of cat cancer.  Why me?
