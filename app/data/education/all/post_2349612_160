so i've been working on graph theory homework for the better part of 2 hours.... had a CD in the whole time.  i just *now* realized that i accidentally hit the "repeat" button and have been listening to the same enya song over and over for the past hour and a half instead of the whole CD...  that's just plain sad that it took 1.5 hours for me to even *notice* the repetition.  what does this say about my head? discuss. =P
