My english grammar professors will cringe should they ever read this blog.....alliteration run amok.  I was searching the net for a suitable photo of myself to put on this blog (more exist than I thought....somewhat harrowing, I may add).  I found one at www.liquidbean.com.  The Bean was my Cheers throughout high school.  I come from a small town (relatively speaking), so most everyone knows each other.....and each other's name.  My old band played a show there once....good times.  I spent most every night of my junior year there "doing homework"; honestly, I had a crush on one of the baristas.  She was older, and way too popular for me.    I have a friend who complicates me.  I have a jones for her, and she knows it (i'm that guy....the one who lets others know things).  She is moving away soon, so it would be an all-encompassing disaster for me to pursue her.......but yet i still try.  We're close, but I have yet to gauge her correctly; I don't know what she is thinking.  My pursuits may turn out to be fruitless because she doesn't want me.    Have I mentioned I suck at wooing?  I'm much better with actual relationships than I am with trying to start them.  C'est la vie.  Har de barberblad?
