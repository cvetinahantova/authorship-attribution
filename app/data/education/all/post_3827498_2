My allergies are no longer under control, so I'm in full-on bubble-boy mode: I've sealed all the windows and retreated to an inner room with my books and computer games. Nature has been trying to kill me since I was born. Any exposure to the sexual organs of plants and their various ejaculates (i.e. flowers and pollen) and my lungs fill with snot and I'm sneezing my face off. Heavy doses of allergy drugs can prevent this, but the side effects for me are extreme fatigue, ennui, and depresssion. Fucking flowers.
