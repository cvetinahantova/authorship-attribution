I have a question, for females only, please, guys feel free to comment, but I really don't want to know what a man's favorite body part is, we all know that answer already!  What is your favorite male body part? Seriously, you know the part that you could just look at, linger your fingertips on softly, absentmindedly stroking while sitting in the movies, at dinner, or just on the couch watching the game?  Mine?  Arms.  Yep, toned, well shaped biceps do it for me everytime.  I love running my hands gently across the firm curve of my man's bicep.    Just like I love that one specific blood vessel that always bulges when he is working on something, and has to flex his arms.  Not the intentional flex, the one you catch off guard, when he's lifting the trash can to dump it, or when he catches the youngest child in his arms on the way in the door from work and raises the child above his head.  Or when those arms are holding his weight above me, with my arms pinned, as he leans in closer an closer...then ruins it by tickling me to the point I am snorting and sqeaking like a mouse.    Those arms, are the ones I love.
