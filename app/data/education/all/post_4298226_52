When morning comes, another chapter of my life has gone  The pages couldn’t be rewritten, the titles couldn’t be erased  Everything is there, black on white  For a brief moment I panicked, I’m scared….   What if the book of my own life can’t be bestseller?  What if no one likes my life?   Again….I’m panicked, I’m scared…..  I tried to write on the pages all over again  But I can’t…  No matter how I tried, I can’t rewrite history  Even history of my life  I can’t tell the mornings not to come  I can’t hold the arrival of the mornings   Now….now….I understand  I can’t make others to like my life  Now, now I got it…  That’s it’s okay my life is not perfect   As long as I like my life….  As long as I can tell myself that my life  Has to go on….  No matter how hard it is  After all…..  It is my life….
