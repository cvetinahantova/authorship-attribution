I think my Chinchilla may have found a prospective new home.  It will be a wonderful home for him to habitat in.  The only thing I worry about is that every other pet I have owned has been given to this person for some reason or another. Like my fish, Jonah and Noah, who were suppose to go over and just visit for the weekend...but they never came home and were given new names...something like Butch and Sundance.  That was upsetting.  Soon after the new owner killed them.  This brings up the idea... what kind of pet hotel are they keeping if they are going to kill dumb fish.   Next was my most precious pet.  Scout.  The most fabulous dog ever.  I saw him at Petsmart and just had to have him but couldn't because of my apt living.  So this person said that he would take little Scout home.  That was a great idea at first...but now I never get to see him and he is deprevied of seeing me. Scout is so sad about that.   So finally, if I give Winston to him..so many ideas come to mind.    I can't say too much.  I am truly grateful.  And who knows this person could decide at the last minute that they don't want to keep Winston.  I hope so though..I think this person may be the only person I know that would not try to kill him and make a pillow, a houseshoe, a coat, a small dinner, ...lets see, what else have I heard....out of his fat little body.
