OMG! I BROKE A NAIL!!!!! lol no...seriously I broke anail today...lol  I said that said that to my manager and I bursted out laughing.... I AM A GIRL I thought.... Never in my days would I have ever thought I would hear myself complain about  breaking a nail..lol  See I never was a girly girl.... had female parts... but acted like a boy. A tom boy! I use to play with bugs. I remember in 5th grade my "boyfriend" and I would go out to the soccer fields and catch grosshoppers. I use to play with rolly pollies.....well......still do.... but those things are sooooooooooo cute.. lol I was a rought and tough girl. I would play a goally caus eI was the only girl that didnt cry when she got hit in the face with a soccer ball. When I wasnt playing a goally I was passing up the guys by runnig and kicking the ball from them. Dresses and skirt where OUTLAWED at that age to me.... there was NO WAY I was going to dress all girlly... nce I started growing the boobs... I still then said noooooo waay....   BUt after my body began to curve and form I became more interested in girly stuff... but not for me... NO WAY! PLus I was too fat to look good an a dress or skirt. BUt now. I have lost some wait.. DOnt have a flat tummy but my tummy isnt huge! I can wear skirts and look pretty good now. Once I realized that. My down to the quick bitten nails were an embrassment. SO I got my nails done. and now I am proud to say I am a girl!  GIRL POWER! lol... Loves Sheila
