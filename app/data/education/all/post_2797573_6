This is a crazy time.  Jacob is graduating and there is so much to do.  Yesterday he had a picnic for his school club and then he had his baccalaureate service.  I have lots of papers to grade and report cards to do.  Then, after school tomorrow I have to clean and organize my classroom.  My parents are coming on Friday for the graduation, so I need to have the house looking semi decent.  Our land lady is coming on Saturday, so we want things to look good.  I like to be busy, though, so that is a good thing.  I am more productive when I'm busy.  Next week my dad is flying in to Portland to help my sister drive out to Alabama.  She is starting over.  I hope it goes well for her.  Then we are going down to AL next week, also.  Sarah is going to summer school, so we have to come back on the sixth.  Sean is taking his vacation on July 5, so we are going to go camping down at the gulf coast.  I'm looking forward to it!
