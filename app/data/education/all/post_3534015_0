Well, after the debates, subsequent newspaper articles, and discussions, I have solidly decided upon the Conservative Party as being the best choice.  In other news, my job hunt is coming along.  It strikes me as amazing sometimes, that it doesn't matter how many times you go through the same situation, there is always something new to pull out of it.  I dislike thinking about "what next", but I have to.  This mini-contract that I am on isn't going to last forever.  My interview with Math and Stats went well, and I have an interview with Neurology (I think) on Friday.  In the meantime, I am starting to like what I am doing in Family Medicine.  Lots of little bits of everything.  If only someone could/would call a ceasefire on the wretched politicking.    They say Death and Taxes are the only two sure things in life.  I disagree.  You can evade Taxes.  Death and Politics:  They walk hand in hand as Universal Constants.
