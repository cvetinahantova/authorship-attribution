I made $100 at work tonight!  Go me!  I had some really excellent tippers, and I thank every one of them for contributing to the "Pay Steph's Bills" fund... LOL  On an even better note...  There is this (what I thought was) very nice older African-American gentleman who comes in pretty often to buy stuff from package goods.  He has nicknamed me "Baby Girl" and is so sweet every time he comes in.  Well, today we got to talking and he asked me how old I was.  He said that I looked 17, so when I told him I was 25, he said I was blessed to be so young-looking, and that I would appreciate it when I am older.  He then proceeded to tell me that his daughter got very depressed when she turned 30.  I was thinking that his daughter was just some regular old person.  He says to me, "You know who my daughter is, don't you?"  I told him I didn't, and he said, "Chilli."  I must have had a confused look on my face, because he elaborated with, "From TLC."  I was starstruck.  He said that he didn't have contact with his daughter for nearly his entire life, and then she found him a couple years back and they went on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show to reunite.  He also told me not to mess with boys my age because they are trash (LOL).  He said that Chilli got involved with a man much younger than she is (yes, he was talking about Usher), and that he cheated on her and broke her heart.  Marty confirmed the man's story, and after doing some research on the 'Net, I confirmed the story myself.  His name is Abdul Ali, and he lives in AC.  He was stationed at Fort Benning when Chilli's mom got pregnant, but he was shipped off before even finding out he was going to be a father.  He is SUCH a nice man and SO proud of his daughter, understandably so.    So there's my little piece of fame.  I still have yet to meet an actual celebrity and talk to them, but at least now I can say that I know a celebrity's dad!
