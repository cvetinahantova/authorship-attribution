As Bush arrived in Ireland, he was met with a crowd of protestors. They hate him. They hate the war. In short, loyal readers (whoever you may be), they hate us. For no reason. Protestors of this war say Bush is taking human rights and pitching them straight into the fires of hell. Forgive me if I'm wrong on this one, but wasn't THAT what Saddam was doing when he threw men, feet first, into wood chippers in front of their wives and children? I would call raping a woman to get information out of her husband a bigger infraction of human rights than the liberation of an oppressed nation. There are actually fools who are so weak minded that they actually confuse the two.  They want us to feel bad for the terrorists because they are an oppressed people; they are frustrated revolutionaries. When the time comes, and we leave Iraq to govern herself in peace and plenty, what will they say then? What negative spin can they place on that situation? The world is evil folks, and growing more so by the day. I'm just waiting for someone to start dragging a square of marble back up to the temple mount. Good thing too. I'm ready to go to heaven.   People are SO against war that they protest one done for the right reasons. No one in their right mind can tell me that Saddam wasn't a despot, or that he wasn't burying his victims in mass graves. How can people, who say they care about human rights, honestly protest a war that took a man that evil out of power!? It makes no damn sense to me at all. I was once proud to be of Irish heritage, but between this little stink and the torture of reading James Joyce I say fuck the Irish. I'm American and proud of it.   I've got my head screwed on right. I'm pissed as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.
