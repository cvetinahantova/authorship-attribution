Have you ever felt like no one cares? I mean I know there are people who love and care for me but I have gone so far away from all of them I am not sure what to do. I have gone away to new places before, none as different as this before though. I have always been able to make friends and find my niche but lately, here in the middle of no where, I seem to be the odd girl out. My co-workers while most of them are nice I just don't seem to click and form that bond of friendship. I love living on a college campus but the summers suck!There is no one here except the staff. I think its harder cause I am in small town USA... It's hot and windy and no one wants to go outside. Well all this complaining and while it's true I think I am just venting.... too lonely I guess. The terror of a small town... only a couple of more years though. Op la di Op la da!
