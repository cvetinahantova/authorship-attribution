Things like this make me want to give up   Hi all, I remember that with a c++ char, it always has a trailing '\0' right? so if i have a char named name and i want it to hold 5 characters. Then i would declare it with char name = new char[6]? and when i do strlen it would give me 6 too right?  please clarify thanks.   These are 3rd year students. Did the world turn retarded while I wasn't paying attention?
