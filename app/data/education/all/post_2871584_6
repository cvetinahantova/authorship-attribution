I spent a few hours online this afternoon deciding what I was going to do at Mardi Gras.  Then, I went to the store tonight, and bought a bunch of travel stuff for my trip.  It's finally starting to feel real--in less than a week, I will be in New Orleans.  Woohoo!   Between that and the promise of an upcoming interview, this week should be a fantastic one.  ::knocks on wood::  Other than that, today was fairly uneventful.  I did get some reading done, which was nice, and I caught "Dogma" on TV, which is *always* worth a good laugh.  And...that was today.  Done.
