I volunteer.  I've been mouse brown, and more recently mouse brown with highlights until today.  Actually the transformation started to happen last night around midnight.  My highlights were growing out, I have a coffee date tomorrow morning, and I was ready for a fix.  I happened to have a box o color handy... boom! Bazooka Joe!  It started well, ended poorly.  Well, not all that bad.  But I was a little red, and not embarassed red, hair red.  That was not the look I was going for, so today I paid a visit (and $160) to the local Salon.  Matt did the color, and he is fab.  Over at Teddie's... if you need color he is your man - and he isn't even gay!  Tell him I sent you.  ;)  He did a fix, and didn't charge corrective color prices - which would have jacked it up to $300.  Thanks Matt.  So now I'm a gorgeous blonde - the hair is gorgeous really!  Nikki did a cut and style and she is great too... seen her before and been very happy.  The parents think it's cool, the kids a little creeped out by it, but the neighbors like it too... NN said hi in the parking lot, but I kinda blew him off... he was chatting w a chick.  So I gained 3 pounds, blech.  Saw the personal trainer today, she said I looked good, but I think she's talking out of her ass.  I gotta start working on that.  Not talking out of my ass... the weight thing.    Ok, so hair is done, nails done, and I have a cute outfit for the coffee meet.  I hope this works... he seems like a really great guy.  From now on we'll see if blondes have more fun!
