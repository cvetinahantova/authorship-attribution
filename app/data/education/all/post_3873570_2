Today was another Saturday in my life. I spent quality time with Steve... we went to have lunch to his buddy's place in downtown San Leandro... we later went to Tapioca Express and I bought some milk tea for my buddy and dropped it off at the mall... I saw her for just a bit, but it was nice... At 5 we went to Union City to watch  The notebook. I've been wanting to watch it for six weeks. I don't know why, but I knew that it was my kind of movie. I haven't seen such a great movie in years!!! I am not the kind of person who buys DVDS, but as soon as this one is out, I want to buy it!!!!    After watching the movie, I wished that my love for Steve was as strong as the love Alley and Noah had. I normally tear in almost any movie, but in this one I cried rivers... It's a must see... an old times like love story. When the movie ended, everyone, or at least so it seemed, was crying. It was cathartic and woke up my romantic side. It also deals with Alzheimers, and the choice to die when ur body is giving up. If I were very sick or had a devastating disease I would choose to die. But as long as I am relatively healthy, I will never leave this world... even if at times I wish I would be gone... I cannot be so selfish to leave when some people count on me... at times I think that's not the case... but when I am sharp I realize that they do...the quick fix would be to take your life so you no longer have to feel... I am not such a coward... or I am one because I could not even try to end my life...even at the darkest moments there is a tiny glimmer of hope... life is a miracle every day... each day should be the first day of that miracle... whoever reads this, specially you Teesa, I love you and need you lots... don't you ever leave me alone in this sometimes cruel world...
