I've been out of town the past few days so that explains why I have not been blogging.  I went to Atlanta to get my work visa and then I went to visit some family and friends.  It was a good trip.  The visa looks a little bit different this time around.  Before it was a stamp, now it's like a sticker inside my passport.  Either way it's pretty cool.  I also received my flight schedule and tickets today.  I should be arriving in Daegu about 8 pm on Monday night.  This is as good a time as any.  I have about a week to get it all together before going out on Saturday.  Needless to say I'm greatly looking forward to coming back to Korea.  On the down side I have a fairly hefty layover in Chicago.  That is gonna suck some ass.  This will only be the second time I've been to Chicago.  I'm assuming I'll be in Oâ€™Hare b/c Midway is a piece of shit.  I can't believe I've been over here this long.  I feel like I wasted a lot of time waiting for all this damn paper work to happen.  What a pain in the ass.   Tonight my brother came in.  Apparently he doesn't have work tomorrow.  So the two of us and some friends are going to head to Buffalo's and drink a little bit.  I need to get back in the habit of drinking.
