I mean, migraine, head pain, giddiness. My new specs prescriptions clashes wif my contacts'. Bugger. For 2 and 1/2 weeks I've been tolerating my excruciating pain in my already hay-wired head!!  I'm just gonna wait for pay day before making my new prescriptions. I may look cool n bold... but now i'm real cold n a puddle of mush or mud for tat matter. Tis head pain really makes me drag drag drag!!  When I compare myself to a yr before, there are some improvements. Mood swings lesser. Body tighter. Skin tanner. But the head, head-acher!! *oh Nurul stop complaining bout your head. Lucky u still haf one!!*  Oh how lovely if I could just fast forward to Friday. 3 hours of school. Den smashing good-time lunch wif dearest Pauline n crazie colligs! At nite, proposed dinner wif Sazymaera aka Helena. Oh... y does she call herself that? ;]  Den a super long weekend till next Wednesday where I'll go out n enjoy, swim, play table tennis, jog, train.... sigh.. You mite be wondering wat kind of triathlete I am???? Well, I'm an aspiring one. My goal, simple. To be fit n active so that my body does not hamper my abilities to do anything.... including ber'ibadah'...  Well... gotta go... Napha Test duty starting soon... I'm taking the 1.6km run... Take care Diary... Can't wait for Mr Zirk to fetch me from school... by the wae, he's the fiance.... hehe...
