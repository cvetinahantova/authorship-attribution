Last night  was the talent show. it was good, and Chris played the piano AMAZINGLY (and Irina sang well too, cant forget about her, i guess, even though she was kind of just an added bonus of Chris's performance LOL)... i also got to see Amanda M. doing her little hip hop dance with all the other hip hop dancers LOL (i know it and she knows it, she was always looking around to see what to do next, but she wasnt the only one LOL). It was also the end of the soap opera that the animateurs have been putting on for us throughout the whole program, but it was a cliffhanger! Marie set the hospital on fire with everyone in it, but we dont know who lives and who dies! :(.... im hoping that they will do another part at the Gala on Thursday, but it is doubtful. We got out past curfew, and then me and Matt went to talk to Chris in his room for a while, and Godefroi saw us talking in english at midnight and still didnt give us warnings, because everyone loves us! (that was deserving of both a linguistic AND behaviour warning! LOL)      This morning class was boring. this afternoon is our last workshop, and since the album has already been taken to the printers, we were supposed to go swimming. But we're not, because the weather was bad this morning when they made the decision to not go, even though it is nice now. Im so glad, because i just dont like swimming, and i dont even have a bathing suit here LOL... so, instead, we are doing something in the classroom.... Chantal and Marie said that they still have a surprise for us though, so i cant wait to see what it is! (im sure it cant be EXTREMELY exciting, but ya never know iwth this crazy place LOL).       so, i guess thats it for now... we dont know what we are doing after the workshop, but its free time so we'll probably do SOMETHING lol... Au revoir!
