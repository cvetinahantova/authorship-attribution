The Mystery  Girls   Morrissey, of all people, convinces  urlLink the New York Dolls to reunite   (Izzy Stradlin will fill in for Johnny Thunders).  Huh?  Morrissey?   When the dolls acted like girls, it was cool.  Morrissey acts like a girl, and he's just annoying.  In interest of science, then, it seems fair to conclude that acting like a girl is not a determining factor in coolness and/or annoyingness, but dressing in drag may help with the former and combat the latter.
