We came back from the bike ride fine, everyone on a high having enjoyed themselves, although the kids were tired and hungry.   Vicky, a friend of my wife had asked me if she could take Sandra out tonight, but didn't want me to tell her - a surprise to cheer her up. The problem is when Vicky rang to confirm with Sandra, she said she had already arranged it all with me....needless to say I got both barrels!  "Why didn't you tell me....I don't want to go out....have friends treating me like a charity case....its alright for you you've got the label 'depression"....its not you that wakes up wanting to be dead."  I had wondered how long it would take to be thrown back in my face - 2 days was quicker than I had thought. "You were the one that made me get counseling....if you feel like that you should go to the doctors too" I retorted.  "You weren't supposed to go to a doctor!" came the response, she ignored the part about her going to the doctors.  The whole experience has me feeling as though I have taken another 2 steps backwards. We had been getting on OK for the last few days, making progress, getting a dent in the finances, helping each other through. Now it all seems to have gone again. I feel lost. I feel drained.
