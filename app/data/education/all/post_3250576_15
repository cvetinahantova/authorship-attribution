She is always looking cute and Ted is always taking pictures of her.  Sadly, when we move next week, Cat will have to go live with my mom and not be our Cat anymore :(  I'm sure these posts have been very exciting for one and for all....but I've got to do something to pass the time while Ted is at work!
