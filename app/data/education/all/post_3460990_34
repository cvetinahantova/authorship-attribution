Um, yeah, so my "do-it-myself" plane connection in Dallas didn't go so well. I made a big mistake by arranging my transfer through Love Field instead of DFW, where I actually touched down. This lead to being stuck at DFW for about 3 and a half hours, followed by a road trip with my sister-in-law and both kids from Dallas into Austin. Yay.  Oh well, I'm actually here, so I guess that's good. I started work on Mom's house this morning, trying to get the bedrooms empty so we can go ahead and put the kids' furniture in there so they can stop having to sleep on the couch.  I worked for several hours, then went out. First I stopped at Starbucks, which was an extremely well-needed experience, then continued on to Olive Garden for a glass of Sangria and some good conversation with my friend AmyKatPat.  Tomorrow is yet another day, and there is lots left to be accomplished!
