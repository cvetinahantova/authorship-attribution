I don't really have time to blog tonight.  What am I talking about?  Hmm... I  do  have time to blog tonight, but I don't really feel like it.  There-- that's a little more accurate.  I came to blog and the first thing that came to my head when I got to my page was "yikes!  I have  got  to change my template.  This bright, clean, simple, green stuff is just not going to work for me right now.  I guess I'm just not in that kind of a mode.  My mode is more like this:  I can't believe school is starting so soon.  Summer?  What summer?  Where did it go?  I have science guides on my kitchen table covering my plan book, my curriculum map-- which I need to make work and use to work on our science lab schedule.... I also have several books I'd really like to/ NEED to read before school starts and.......... where was I going with this?  I just feel busy.  I don't feel like blogging.  My room at school feels like a tornado exploded through my files and I'm just.......ugh!  Don't get me wrong-- great summer.... AWESOME summer of learning and I did see my family, but my brain just feels like one of those plants that has been watered and it's waiting for the water to seep through to the soil.  Yep- I'm just waiting.  But right now, there's just too much damn water sitting on the surface waiting to soak through.  Off to find a new template.  I guess you'll find out which one I picked if you're reading this.  You?  Who does read this?  lol.... gonna scoot.
