Hey, I just got back from workWell today was my first day back to work since last Thursday when I was done teaching 3/4 bilingual class. I haven't been doing well so I wasn't up to going into the classroom. I wasn't ready for that. Today was a great day! I am so happy I went because the staff was very welcoming and warming. When I walked into the lounge in the morning to get keys and attendance there was all kinds of food. I was thinking in my mind "what is the occasion" and then I left I went to my room and looked over the lesson plans and then I went back to the lounge. When I walked back I needed to look for some girl to get some info regarding testing and then when I was looking for her the secretary was like go get some food you are like part of the staff, in that same moment the principal walked over and escorted me into the lounge and served me some mango juice and was so nice and friendly. Then I realized it was staff appreciation day and they were having a breakfast. I have really gotten to know the staff at that school and everyone was so helpful. It was a good day. It was good times. i have to go now ill finish my story later someone just came by and were going to the store. bye bye don't worry won't let you hanging ill get on here later bye '
