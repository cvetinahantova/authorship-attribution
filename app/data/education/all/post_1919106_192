I've been improving my program to customize the colors. I still need to change a few things, but I'm hoping that soon it'll be able to individually set any of the RGB base colors,or any combination thereof. I've added methods for Red, Blue, and Green color scales, but they don't work together yet, because they're still mostly based on the old archaic code. Eventually I'll fix that though... I hope. And I also need to change the coloring methods to determine the color that needs to be darkened based on the color that the cell owns. The problem with that though is that if one cell has a blue base color and the next a red base color, then it will change the blue color on a red scale, and that is just asking to be shot in the foot and having the leg blown off while you're at it. No, I need to have the class get a base color, and use that to override the cell colors. That shouldn't be all too difficult... Most of the architecture already works with such changes in mind, and all that needs to be changed is the target from which the base color is extracted, and that's just a one-liner.  Setting up the events handlers is a bit of a pain though... The API is not clear on how that works, and the modules that I included that should have fixed that didn't... So I'll probably go back to my trusty source of the FXRuby mailing list and pester them until someone gives me an answer.  OT: Someone brought to my attention that the comments section required a Blogger account to post. That has been fixed, or so I hope.
