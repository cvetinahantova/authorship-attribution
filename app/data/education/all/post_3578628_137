I've chosen this place to settle a problem that I became aware of by chance.  I've had an issue with someone for a few weeks and at Cedar Point, you wouldn't know there was anything wrong...but I still feel like making sure everything is settled.  Nothing will be held back and in fact, it will involve some very big issues that you might not want to care about.  Right now, I don't plan on forcing anyone to go with what I say.  I just want to end a grudge by understanding this person a little better and maybe having this person understand me a little better.    This won't be a quick thing.  In order to do this right,  I won't throw all my thoughts into one posting, or even let it all out in one day.  I am guessing this will go on for about four to five days at least.  This person is someone who without, my life would be drastically different.    And if anyone knows me, I don't lose friends.  I make them.
