The  urlLink wreckage of a helicopter has been found near Bario , and it is believed to be the one that went down almost three weeks ago.  The pilot's window is broken, but the passenger window is intact.  As I understand it, troops are on the way to the scene, but the passengers could not be seen by the helicopter that found the crash site.
