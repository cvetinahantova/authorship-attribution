Why does Change always scare me? I sometimes wish that I could control things but other times I am glad that life is such an existential journey.        You ask me if I will miss you when you are gone and I think about it everyday and it hurts so bad. You are the best friend that anyone could have and my life is all spinning in directions that I haven't felt before.       I finally found a way to contact Maggie and I am soooo scared. I want for us to be good friends but I remember that I used to be totally in love with her and don't want for that to happen while I am so young.
