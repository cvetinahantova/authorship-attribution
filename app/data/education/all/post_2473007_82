Peel it all away, melt the masquerade    Take and break distraction from my brain Scrape away the mold, hammer our the gold    Engage an age of change despite the pain  All the placebo measures make me sick    Houdini failed to sell his trick The slope is steep and growing slick    And in a tundercrash I'm grasping at the sky  Eliminate seducing voices Illuminate divinest choices Drown out the world and all of its noises Eradicate.
