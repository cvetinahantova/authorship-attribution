.............................................................. things we hear mostly inside of our heads. ..............................................................  1. the sound of a towel drying your hair after the shower or a swim.    you hadn't thought about it, had you? but its a sound that's very singular, and relatively enjoyable -- particularly when you think about how *yours* it is.  possibly those with very short locks will not have the same delightful experience.   2. the sound of your own voice.   i mean really -- is it surprising that people are delusional?  given the unreasonable amount of influence that we have upon ourselves?   peace~
