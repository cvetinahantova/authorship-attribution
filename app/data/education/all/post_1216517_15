DON'T WORRY MA, I'M ONLY IN LAKE BLED  I ate at  urlLink Sizzler  today.  For the first time ever.  If you've never eaten there before, let me tell you, you are missing out.  Steak?  Savory.  Salad Bar?  All-you-can-eat.  Need I say more?  The steak was damn good too mind you.  Excellent herb and spices along with a great baked potato.  Yum.  I could just throw it up and eat it all over again. Well, all this steak talk brings me back to the Great Slovenia Ass Steak I enjoyed in  urlLink Lake Bled   this past October.  You can even consult William on this one if you're so inclined.  Now, the proper name for the meal was "Rump Steak," but we prefered "ass steak" amongst ourselves.  It was a humongous serving of meat.  Filled up the plate.  I had 3 of them during my stay there.  So good.  So savory.  Also in this wonderful place I drank the  urlLink best beer in the world .  The Original Budweiser from the Czech Republic.  Very very good.   Overall, one of the best meals I've ever had.  If anybody has any good meal stories, send them my way.  I'm always in the market for the low down on good food. The Bled experience as a whole was great.  We stumbled upon the  urlLink World Bartending Championship .  Hiked through this incredibly beautiful gorge.  I stayed in Bled of 5 days, that's the longest I stayed at any one single place in Europe.  Hung out with Australians and Brits along with whoever else cruised by.  I was beginning to get in the rythem of things and at the end it was very diffcult to leave.  It was a great place.  It treated me good.
