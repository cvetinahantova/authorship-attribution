urlLink Houston News   This article gives you a background about the Houston Aquarium that I visited recently when Jeremy graduated High School.  I will be posting some pictures of the vertical fish tank and different shots of different types of fish.  I have to say that this is a very nice restaurant and you will be amazed at the size of these tanks and the different varieties of fish that they have.
