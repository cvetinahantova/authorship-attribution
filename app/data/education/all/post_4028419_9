Today is just one of those "blah" days.  A day that is masked more in gray than in color or black-and-white.  Well, I went with a friend to see Jamie Foxx's new movie "Collateral".  I think Tom Cruise was supposed to be the star (and he was good), but Jamie did his thing.   Everyone should see it and support the black man:)  Well, I had to wake up at the butt-crack of dawn...well, okay 9:30, but that's still early.  I went to finish up my classroom.  Funny thing is, we had to be out of there by 3, and I put in the last staple at 3 on the dot! Go figure.  Then I went to get some last minute items (i.e. lunch stuff, shoes, etc.).  When I got home, I washed my hair and straightened it.  A friend called and wanted to treat me to the movies (which is how I ended up at "Collateral").  Talked to K tonight.  He's great.  He's a decent person--hard to figure out, at times--but a very decent person.  Talked to H.  He's still crazy--still saying the same ol' same ol'...Man, I'm glad I'm such a game peeper!:)  Well, gotta go get ready for my students to "tear up" the new room--lol;).   Peace up, A-town...lol, naw just kidding:)
