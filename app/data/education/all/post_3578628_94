I looked at the poll when they were trying to figure out whether or not to change the face on the 10 dollar bill.  From the argument between Spencer and I, I do believe it's reasonable to be split.  I'm not saying I don't think you're right Spencer.  I'm just saying if I had to pick between heads or tails (heads being new ppl) (tails being stay the same) I would go with heads.  Really though the opinions are split 50/50.
