urlLink Open Questions in Mathematics Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest was written by Britton, Edward - Raizen, Senta - Kaser, Joyce - Porter, Andrew.  From the ERIC Digest:  The "No Child Left Behind Act" signed into law on January 8, 2002, places strong emphasis on state accountability for educational results and use of teaching methods that have been proven to work [see http://nclb.gov/next/overview/]. For teachers, these expectations highlight the importance of attending to issues of equity and diversity in mathematics classrooms, and the need to critically examine the existing research base both for evidence of best practices and gaps in our understanding that constitute areas of needed research. Educators and researchers need to know a lot more about how to address the increasingly acute diversity and equity issues in educating today's and tomorrow's children in mathematics.   Presented here are highlights and recommendations from a working forum (Britton, Raizen, Kaser, & Porter, 2000) where participants considered diversity and equity issues in mathematics and science education, with special emphasis on research directions for the future. Topics discussed at the forum covered a wide range of curricular and instructional equity issues in K-12 education, including the scaling up of successful programs. A number of clear research directions emerged from the forum.
