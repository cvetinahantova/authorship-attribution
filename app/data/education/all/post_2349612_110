good morning!  let it be known, today is the first day in over two weeks that i didn't have to set an alarm to tell me when to get up... this is the first night in two weeks that i got enough sleep!... this makes me happy.  what makes me even happier?  look at that to do list in the margin... see the next due date?  monday... that's a whole 5 days away!  this means that while i could start homework tonight, i also have the option of chilling for a little and catching up with my life, which seems to have gotten out of my control lately... i like knowing that i have time to breathe again!  know what's even better?  look at the "exciting upcoming events" list in the margin too!  there's something there again... and it's even better than just having something there... due to crazy schedules, jessica and me haven't gotten to hang out since january... we finally have plans and they're fun ones... we're going to hang out at philly's italian market that saturday, get fun stuff, and make it into a party. =)  i'm excited. =)  as eric keeps saying... just 4.5 more weeks of this torture til summer break... 4.5... i think i can handle that. =)  happy wednesday to all y'all!
