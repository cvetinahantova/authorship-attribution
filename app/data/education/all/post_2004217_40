So, last night came the evening of the Christmas Party. By this time it had already been confirmed that anyone who I planned to go anywhere with on that night was going to the Boy's School Christmas party at Revolution, until, in true bitchy girl style, "someone" (i.e., according to rumour, Pav) contacted said bar and informed them that we were underage. Shit. So, all manner of confusion occurs, including the following questions:  Are you going to the Boundary instead? No. Is it definitely at Revolution? No. Is there still going to be a party? Yes! Where is it? Don't know. What does Hemal say? Apparently it's at Stein Bar now. So it's definitely at Stein Bar? No. Shall I just meet you in Imperial? Yeah.  The common room became a hive of phone calls and text messages, and nothing became clear until Hemal finally appeared in Imperial at 8.45 (the party started, in fact, at 8pm, but I think we were being "fashionably late" or something) to tell us that we were going to the Stein Bar between 9 and 9.30pm, because that was when the football finished and the rest of the boys' school would leave Bar Sport. Riiiight. Eventually, we arrived at Stein Bar and a generally good time was had by all, from what I could tell. Gaz tried to pull Bex but did not succeed as we were leaving, Rachelle Horton's boyfriend tried to feel me up  twice . and I met J(ay), the sweetest guy ever to exist. He's small but perfectly formed and generally a really nice guy- he complimented me on my dress (incidentally, he was the only person to do so), squeezed my hand and made me smile :o) Awww. Fab.
