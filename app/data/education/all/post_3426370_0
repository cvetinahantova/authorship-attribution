But i'll tell you how many times we have moved in my lifetime.....32.....32 times and 3 schools. i can never be sure if i ever see or stay anywhere very long. lived in Tennisee moved to Arkansas moved back to Tennisee then back to Arkansas and from there up to Illinose. and that was all before I even started school. From there we lived there for about 8 years but continues to move in town. It was a small town so i am surprized if we hadn't lived in each house at least once. Well from there we moved to kansas where i had the fun o living through absolute boredom for 365 days. and then we moved to Missouri. And thats that. thats ll the info you'll ever get outta me.
