Hug me!   Yesterday was  urlLink Programmer's day.     This last week...   ...seems to have been horrible for the group. It started bad enough for me, but at least The Lady smiled on me and things got better towards the end. For some of my friends though it seems to have gone down the drain. And there's been certain people who haven't helped the situation at all... and considering what they've done and who they've done it to, I could wish no less than having the flies of a thousand camels infest their erogenous zones. And that would only be the beginning, for if there is  anything  in common between me and my other self then that is that we're both very loyal to friends (mind, it's for different reasons, but we're both loyal nevertheless). Those guys better watch out...   Gaming   I can't believe how much I forgot about AD&D... oh wellses, most of it will come back with practice.
