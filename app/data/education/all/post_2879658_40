Hey everybody, for those of you who read the next post 1st...you were probably wondering why I went to a soccer practice.  For those of you reading this one first, guess what???  Next you will be reading about my journey to and from soccer practice.  Well, in the middle of June, I along with 20+ Miyagi jets will be headed to Nagano for a soccer tournament.  Miyagi will be sending both a girls and boys team to compete.  Neither one is expecting to make a great showing but we will do our best.
