This probably the funniest movie I have seen all year..........so far at least. I was seriously laughing through the entire thing!! It was 80's fabulous!! I kinda want to go back to the theater and see it again, so if anyone hasn't seen it and wants too..........I'll go! lol. I went with Alicia and her co-worker Will, and we got to use my free movie passes from the Manchurian Candidate fiasco. Watching Napoleon completely made up for that night! If you haven't heard the story about the "fiasco", just ask me and I will tell you it, it's just too long to write. Anyway, so on to the job front. I got a lead on a new job..........very exciting. So I called today after my dentist appointment (which I have to go back because I have a defective filling.......wonderful!), and omg the architect that I was calling knows my current boss. Shit shit shit. So hopefully I still have a job, with my current empolyer. I'm really not excited about that. He, the architect, said he was "friends" with my boss, not just that he knew her. I was said "oh really", I thought "mother effer! Shitass". Apparently I will have to move to another state if I want to get another job...........because my boss knows freakin everyone. Oh well, I'd like to move it wouldn't be so bad. But I will have to wait till my lease is up here in LR. hummmm, well it's around 12 pm so I think I shall go to bed now. Goodnight.
