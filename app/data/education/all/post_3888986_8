here is why i should be proud of myself but need help feeling that through my hurt right now...  i told him that i loved him, that i had fallen in love with him through all of this and that i didn't expect him to make any choices, that i was deciding that i needed to say goodbye...  he cried   i was crying the whole time...duh...and he said he felt frustrated...that he really liked our connection but understood why i needed to do this...  if i had not said how i felt and distanced myself from this emotionally explosive situation, i would have slowly eroded away, and hoped and waited for him to change his mind....  but i did say and i did choose...and it's supposed to be liberating and good feeling and this sucks instead...i hate that i had to say goodbye  i hate that he said he did have these feelings for me too but had to be on his own, to live life on his own for awhile to gain a clearer picture of who he is...  i'm angry because i'm not able to manage my feelings into better places where they don't mess up my head and make me cry all the time  i wanted him to say come back to me in 6 months and then i will say "i love you now" but just for now i need to be only friends..  i wanted to be enough....................  i'm not though, and i feel very bad through a place when i'm supposed to be proud that i stood up for suzy  i can't  beat this feeling that something wonderfully special just left my life  so i'm proud... right
