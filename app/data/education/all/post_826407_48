I went to see  urlLink Spirited Away  last night.  It is a truly amazing Japanese anime film.  The animation and detail is breathtaking.   It follows a young girl whose family get lost in a deserted theme park.  The closest parellels are with Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz and some of the early, classic Disney Films.  Much of the symbolism and imagery seemed completly alien and exotic to my western eyes.  It seemed to present childhood as a mix of beauty, awe, alienation and unease.
