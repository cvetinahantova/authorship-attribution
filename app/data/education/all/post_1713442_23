No link today.   And I think that is appropriate.  That big power blackout hit Michigan yesterday.  In fact, some news reports indicate that the problem originated in Michigan before spreading to parts of Canada and the Northeast United States.  What a mess.  We went 5 hours without power in Mt. Pleasant and it seemed like an eternity.  I like to log into the Web whenever I feel like it and I felt uncomfortable not being able to do it.  I live such a different life than most of the people who have lived throughout history. Minor events like a power outage sure drive this home.
