had the LAN finally weekend before last... that was fucking awesome! was the best LAN we've had in my opinion. most people weve had and was just really organized and the games were very nice. we didnt play anything to long, everyone got to play what they wanted and we were all happy... I love that, how you can forget every one of your worries and just have fun with your friends. so nice to have... nathan came down for it which was good of course, its not the same without him... we got plenty of video of him being tackled by conley, kat, jen... and i sat on his head :P there was very little sleeping, it was too hard to find anywhere to sleep in that room so most people didnt bother... the admins took power naps, kat tried but really couldnt due to the hollering of ken, hehe. i was feeling really sick after the LAN and just wanted to go home and sleep. that is exactly what i did, ate some chips and beandip :P and went to sleep around 3... til i was woken up by my mom to get ready for school... thats about 15 hours of sleep, so nice, mustve been the most ive ever slept... so yeah, that was enjoyable, um... actually started reading again, its about time. went to my dads last weekend, just hung out pretty much... my sister was there as well, nice to see her... came back and hung out with kat, witnessed the cleaning of my closet by my brother... eh, hehe... that was interesting. back in school after the weekend, so very interesting. got my computer back, missed the guildies a lot... were growing and are active, good people and tons of fun to play with them. thats as well as i can do to update... nothing personal, prolly better that way ;P trying to think... i feel a rant comin on so ill just end it, thx for reading :)
