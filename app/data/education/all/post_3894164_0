What a long day. It was finally the time to leave the great city of Boston. I had to do one of the things I absolutely loath. I had to pack all of my stuff up. How I hate doing that. Anyway, I will have a lot of fond memories of Boston. There were a lot of people that I met and alot of things that I learned while I was out there. I will miss that place. But it is back to reality and the world that I know.  I shared a cab ride to the airport, sharing the fare always keeps the cost down somewhat. As I was going to the airport I had mixed feelings. I was sad to leave this great environment, but was happy for the memories that I will always cherish in my heart. I will always be greatful for the things I did out in Boston, and for the friendships that came from that time there.  I boarded the plane and everything went without any problems. As we were on our descent towards Chicago we passed through several layers of clouds. At one moment we were above one set of clouds but below another. As I looked up towards the sun, the light broke through and shone into my window, and God winked at me. I felt an overwhelming sense of happiness.  I have been a very fortunate person. I have been a very lucky man. I have been lucky for the things that I have been a part of, and of the people that I have met. This trip has opened my eyes to just how lucky I have been. It has been good to me, and I only hope that it can get better.  So it is with a wink, and a smile that I go forward.
