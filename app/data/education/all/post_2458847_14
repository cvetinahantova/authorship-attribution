David Lynch? What's happening to me?   I've been on a  urlLink David Lynch  kick. I can't stop watching his movies. Over the past week I've watched  Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks-Fire Walk With Me, Lost Highway, and Mulholland Drive . I'm either slightly more insane since this movie watching adventure began, or a little bit better because of it. I never thought I'd get into his films. My first two years of college were spent at a liberal-hippy-commie-artsy-school where "being into" Lynch was hip, so out of spite I only watched one of his films and didn't pay much attention. Living in the woods and having oodles of free time and no one to be cooler than has given me the opportunity to really appreciate what he does. Worth checking out!
