urlLink Technology, Pedagogy and Globalisation   James C Taylor, USQ  Can't help but to agree with Taylor that technology is nothing but a tool to deliver education. We sometimes get too caught up with what technology can do that we forget what they're supposed to be doing in the first place. This program for example has discussion boards as the primary mode for interaction and this at a time when instant messengers, webcam chats, and many more 'fancier' tools for online interaction exists, yet the communications gets by just fine.   I think the 'heart' of any learning process is the learner. The learner is really in control of the learning experience, in whatever mode. In a classroom, although learners are paced and guided, if the learner insistently refuses to take a proactive role in the process, it will be hard for any learning outcomes to arrive.   In flexible learning, whatever the mode, the basis is the idea that the learner is in control and there really isn't any point for control when it isn't fully employed. Studying online for the first time, the process is really rewarding. I am able to maintain my job, my responsibilities and still able to further my education by ensuring I commit some time each day, times that are at my convenience.   There are however certain drawbacks that are noticeable. Unlike my first degree, where the learning outcomes were clearly spelt out in class by the lecturer, having the responsibility in deciding what you learn on your own shoulders is surprisingly daunting, especially when the measure of your learning will be graded. It is both a unique and eye-opening experience that will warrant a lot of critical incidents throughout.  All in all, the final emphasis on the role instructional design plays is certainly more than justified. Like Taylor says, the technology employed and the manner in which the learning is disseminated will be meaningless if the quality of the instructional message falls short.
