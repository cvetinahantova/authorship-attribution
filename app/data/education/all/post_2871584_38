I'm down in NJ right now.  The trip down wasn't too bad, except for when I remembered that I was allergic to this state.  Since I have had no allergy problems in NY this spring, I didn't even think about how miserable I was last spring in NJ.  Sure enough, as soon as we got down here, my eyes started watering, and I was sneezing and coughing.  And of course I didn't think to bring my good ol' Zyrtec, because I hadn't been having any problems.    As for NJ itself, things are going well.  Interesting, but well.  lol.  All right, in the story I am about to relate, there are three very ... odd factors.  Almost anyone who knows me will be able to figure out the first one.  If you are a close friend, you'll know the second one.  If anyone can figure out all three, major props to you.  That said, here was my evening last night.  First, I went out to dinner with one of my former RAs and some other students.  We went to the China Buffet, and gorged ourselves on Chinese food.  All was good in the world.  After dinner, we drove to Jackson, and went to a male revue.  That was something that I had never done before, and it was ... not exactly what I would have expected, but interesting to say the least.  All I know is that by the end of the night, each and every one of us had gotten a lap dance, and the person that I expected it from the least was the most enthusiastic about her lap dance.  If nothing else, it was very funny to watch people's reactions to things.  Afterwards, the person I had ridden with had me drive back, because she had been drinking very strong vodka and cranberry mixed drinks all night.    So... that was my first day back in NJ.  Today is the concert, and then I'm going to dinner with John and Robin.  Both of those things should be a lot of fun.  I'm sure I'll have more funny stories for later.  :-)
