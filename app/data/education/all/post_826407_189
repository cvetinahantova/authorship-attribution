For a while I have wanted to push the limits of what I use this blog for.  So I'll be starting some occasional serial posts.  They'll all be linked up in my sidebar.  The first 2 are fairly basic:   Singing Aloud:   These are my Psalms.  Songs that I've found and adopted in my worship and devotion.  You, dear reader, only get the words.   Liturgy:   Prayers, Meditations, Poems etc. that I have written or nicked.  Some I've used on my own, some have been used in events.  I just want to store them somewhere.  If anything is of any use to you feel free to take it.
