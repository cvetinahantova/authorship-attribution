Why are we Human are so stubborn? We have this habit of realising out mistakes yet we will repeat. Similarly, when we know something is wrong, yet we will do it. A guy friend of mine ever told me, he knows that sometimes it is wrong to do something, yet he will tend to make that mistakes, but what he can do is to avoid making mistakes. This is indeed human nature of making mistakes repeatedly, but it is a matter of out self control and our own self in preventing outselves from making the mistakes. I reckon the tendency to make a mistake can be controlled by out will. The intention or desire to do something is one thing, but whether you will do or not is another issue. In my previous article of "Feelings", it is out brains that control what we do, however, if we let the feelings control, there will just exist the greater likelihood of making mistakes. I have a friend telling that he had so many regrets and he said he is meant to be like that and never be a good person. However, I always believe 'there is will, there is a way'. This is a matter of whether or not you have this determination. There is so many things in life that we can accomplish, it is just a matter of whether we want to make it happen or not. We may not make it a perfect one, yet we try and that effort will be appreciated. Of course, Do not give yourself so much pressure in doing a good job, what is important is doing what is like and what is right. Just be yourself! Dear friends, you all are special in your own way! That is why I appreciate all of you, every single one of you is my good friend. Knowing you all is a matter of fate and this is something that we cannot ask for. Just have a look at the world population, there are so many people. Yet we can get along together, I really treasure this friendship.
