North Carolina - Spoke at Alexander High School today and was totally impressed with the tradition and respect of the student body.  They really went the extra mile to make the assembly the best it could be.  I had a great time with a school of about 1,700.  I also enjoyed just driving through this state.  Absolutely beautiful.
