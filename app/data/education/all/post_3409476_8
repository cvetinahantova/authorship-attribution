Oh well, we blew their streak.  We had great seats for last nights game.  Field level righ behind 3rd base.  Adam got 4 autographs and before the game and came up to the seats with the biggest grin saying we can leave now.  Well we should have.  ALthough we rallied in the 9th it wasn't quite enough.    Jackson would have a very cute new Dodger outfit if his cousin Melody wasn't so mean.  Just because Erika once stated he doesn't need anymore clothes she believed her.  Oh well there will be other games without her around and we will spoil him then.  Adam and I have a big meeting tonight, he is going to Clevland next week to play in an International Children's Games thingy  http://www.childrens-games.org  All we pay for is the airfare.  The kids stay in dorms and play against other kids from around the world.  So if anyone will be in or around Clevland next week go see my boy play.  I am a little nervous about sending him alone but  he will be with friends.
