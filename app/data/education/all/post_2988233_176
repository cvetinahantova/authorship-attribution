Well, I did it, and you know what?  I didn't feel guilty about it.    I somehow managed to sit down, and drink a glass of wine last night.  BEFORE dinner.  whoohoo, what a slot am I?????  Seriously, I was able to enjoy my glass of wine without those voices in my head saying "what would daddy think?"  Which is a huge improvement.  I did have to listen to the boys whispering behind my back "mom's drinking wine" their daddy can do it, but mom can't.  There is such a double standard in my house.  lol.
