yeah, i just found a theme for my desktop about 1984. i think the idea of a 1984 theme is cool, but i'm not particularly happy with this one. in fact, i'm not really happy with any desktop themes. there are the boring ones that come with the os and everything, but other than that, it's pretty lame.  anyway, i guess i can finally reveal how incredibly boring this place is for the second half of the week. first half, busy. second half, stagnant. which means i just sit around here and do nothing for eight hours.  although today i went to randmcnally.com and planned out our route for our washington trip. coming up pretty fast it is, and i'm excited. so is alley. i'm thinking we'll probably be able to attend at least four new temples on the road there. it'll be fun. alley's doint the planning for what we actually do in seattle, which is fine with me. it's looking like it's going to be a blast, though. we get to drive for hours and hours and see all this good and beautiful stuff. we decided to rent a car to drive up there so that we wouldn't be running the risk of breaking down in the taurus.  speaking of which, we've finally got all the safetyemissionsregistrationtitlechangedriverslicenseinsuranceetccrap done today. what a relief that was. alley's been really great in doing all this stuff. it's been really hard to try to get things done while i'm at work from 8 to 5. and then when i take some time off i end up not getting anything done anyway.  but it's all good now.
