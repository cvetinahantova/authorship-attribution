Well,another weekend draws to a close. Nevermind the fact that my weekends have turned into 4 1/2 day entertainment extravaganzas. :) This was a pretty good weekend. J came home early on Friday and we hung out and watched golf. Yesterday we drove down to the Chicago suburbs to go to a golf shop and IKEA. I got some organizers for my scrapbooking stuff and kitchen drawers, while J got a shaft extracter and some tees. He's going to be reshafting all of his golf clubs whenever the shafts are ordered and delivered. :)  Yay. Another thing to blow $500 on.  As if we haven't spent enough money in the last 3 months, and as if we don't have enough to spend over the next year...blah.  Today we went over to his parent's house for a bit for Father's Day since his dad was leaving town at 1pm for work.  We came home and have been watching the U.S. Open golf tournament ever since.  Phil Mickelson and Retief Goosen are taking turns at who's in the lead at the moment. I can't stand it!  This should be a really quiet week. I have class on Monday and Wednesday morning and I plan on calling the furniture place to find out why it's taken our 8 wk max delivery furniture 13  1/2 weeks to arrive...and it's still not here yet. I'm going to see if they'll give us a discount on what we bought.  No other news to report.  :) Dinner tonight was grilled stuffed burritos...home made. :) Hooray!
