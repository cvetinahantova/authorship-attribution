The H-Factor pulled another Monday night Regular.  *sigh*  She's really getting way out of control.  From now on, she spends Mondays with me or HoJo.  End of Story.  No Argueing.   (I just got a love letter from Lucas on  urlLink Ctrl Alt Del .  No shit.  *sigh*  I love him.)   I am at peace with Monkeypants.  And I have decided that his time is nearly up here, and we're both going to run away to Canada.  I'm finished being a psycho.  (no really.)  I am completely comfortable with him.  I think he's absolutely wonderful and we're going to take things at his pace.  We had a fabulous talk last night about some more of my history.  Then I fell asleep with him.  I love that.  I feel safe and wonderful.  Peaceful.  Beautiful.  Honourable.   Today I will find another job.  Even though my head hurts.  Because if I don't have more money soon, I will be thrown in jail.  Plus, I am afraid that even if I make *enough* money, I will kill the OCD Soop before the summer is over.  She's making me even more insane than I was before.   Maow:  Strange cat.   I need sleep.  And to work on my stories.  Nap time at lunch, I think.
