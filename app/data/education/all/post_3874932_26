MG and I met in Boston (we missed you!!) and had a few epiphanies that I thought I’d try out on you: We are not dealing with opinion leadership b/c it is not product category specific, nor product specific nor brand specific. Our seniors are “use evangelists” for the various uses the technology has, not the above. They do not discuss attributes etc, only the capabilities. We are not dealing with mavens since we do not have consumers with high market knowledge. Again it is “use evangelism.” We are not even dealing with consumer evangelists since again it is use oriented and not brand, category etc. Recall, our seniors do not recall their mode of internet connection let alone their platform, their configuration, where they bought it, or the brand. Their evangelism is oriented toward the fantastic uses the technology has.  Also, We are not dealing with creativity, as Cz… analyzes it since it requires: a domain (a field of inquiry), gatekeepers (to that domain), a contribution to that domain or one that alters/creates a domain (read here recognition). The Cz… creativity is formal. He calls what we observe “creative perhaps, brilliant,” but not creativity. I think we’re dealing with expression (self, group, etc.). And these people’s use of technology to be expressive (as opposed to mastery etc.). I know I’m into self-expression and self-presentation, but I think it IS HERE. I think that is what we see as creative endeavor – construction of self. I’m going with a Goffman-esque rationale for some of this behavior. We are dealing with curiosity as an antecedent state – either inherent quality, or life stage prompted. It might be a lifelong interest or hobby or an emerging on that corresponds to keeper of the meaning etc.  Do these resonate with you?
