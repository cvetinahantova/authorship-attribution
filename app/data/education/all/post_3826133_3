I'm trying desperately to get published. My poetry, my short stories, whatever. I have an ache in my soul that will not be filled until I can hold something in my hands that has a title on it and my name in the by-line. I've been sending stuff out like crazy, but since I've not finished anything, really, its mostly my poetry going out. The problem is that most publishers won't even look at my stuff until I'VE BEEN PUBLISHED PRIOR. How do I get published if being published is one of the requirements? I mean, come on! How ridiculous is that?     Also, Monkeypants has to work all weekend. No Friday night date night this week. There wasn't one last week and there won't be one next week. I'm terribly dissapointed in that. First time Monkeypants has dissapointed me, though, and its not even really his fault. Go figure.    Seester Sekatsim went back home to Dallas. I miss her already. It's amazing how quickly one falls back into old friendships. Love you Seester.
