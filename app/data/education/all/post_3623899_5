I can't believe that i had this strangest dream ever.It all starts at this tamil camp i think.With most faces i see in school.As the camp ended,everybody headed for the exit sign.For me,i saw this cute little hamster on the floor.I picked him up and all of a sudden i was at Orchard if i'm not mistaken.I was having the hamster in my hand.It bit my delicate hand...lol..and i dropped it(CRUEL).Then i picked it up again and i said sorry to it but it vanished in my hand[CRAZY].I continued to walk.After much walking, i came to this taxi stand.There i saw this gril from my primary school.Her name is Jasmine from class 6C.I've got no idea why is she in my dream because i've never spoken to her for once in my six years of school in KCPPS.She asked me if i was going for Jessica Teo's birthday party.I immediately said yes without thinking.So she said that she has got to go to the place as soon as possible because the 'birthday girl',Jessica needed some help with the preparations.So she went off saying that she would see me at the party.Then this  SBS bus appeared.It was bus 166.It stopped at the taxi stand and all the passengers including me boarded the bus.1 thing that i thought was stupid that,why would a bus stop at a taxi stand instead of a bus stop.But anyway it doesnt matter where it stops.wat matters is i've got to get my ass at Jessica's party.Once i got onto the bus i found a perfecr seat for myself which was at the back of the bus in the corner.I was just looking out the window when suddenly there was a voice saying,'this castle was built by a lady and it's the 1st time ever in history, a castle being built by a lady'.'WOW'Can  anybody imagine a castle being built by a lady...not just a lady but by an asian lady.That voice was a man's voice.Like those in tour buses,where u have your tour guide talking.The castle was really huge and it had a disgusting color,brown.So i pressed the bell and alighted at the stop.I was wondering if Jessica was out of her mind wanting to celebrate her birthday in a castle which wasn't even hers.I made my way up where Jessica had her party with the help of a 'manager' of the castle.Jessica was wlecoming everyone with her gorgeous smile.Then i immediately asked her what was going on.. why are you having a party here.She said that Its a place where you can held parties and funtions.I was shocked.Totally shocked to what she had said because who would ever built a castle just for functions to be held.WEll..its all in my dreamland.Would never happen in reality.There were many indian girls there.They came up to me and introduced themselves to me.Very friendly girls.KInda funny seeing so many indian girls there.Jess is probably getting hooked into the indian mania.. lol.That the end of the dream.I know it is very lame but that was exactly what i dreamt.
