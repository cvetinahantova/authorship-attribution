A  urlLink link .  What bothers me about this guy is that he seemed to start out as a regular person and he gradually changed into a monster.  I know that our prison system is deeply flawed, but I never realized how it corrupts everybody that comes in contact with it.  I can't think of what turned this guy into a sadistic psychopath except what he did in his job as a prison guard.  I've noticed at school that many teachers are as bad as the students;  I wonder how I've changed in ways that I don't even perceive.  A large percentage of my kids suffer from emotional disabilities and emotional overlay, with another sizable percentage that are involved with the legal system, with some overlap.  I wonder what they are teaching me while I am teaching them.  It's disturbing to me that I might not realize the effect my job has on me.
