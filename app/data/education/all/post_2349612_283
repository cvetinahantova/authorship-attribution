we got a house, we got a house, hey hey hey hey, we got a house!  so colleen called this one apartment ad this morning, played phone tag with the guy all day and we met him this evening and saw the place... it's in highland park -- clear the other direction of campus from where i am now, but a little closer to campus.  the landlord is the fire marshall for the town... he lives across the street... we'll rent the top floor of a 2 story house, with our own washer/dryer... 3 bedrooms, 1 bath, kitchen, dining area, and living room... plus a fireplace and a porch... the yard is nice and well-landscaped... kinda has a cute garden-y feel... we meet again tomorrow to hand over the security deposit and sign the lease... it'll be great :-)  yay for having a place to live.  just talked to eric -- we decided we're not bad people if we don't start studying til next week, so that's the new plan :-P  hopefully seeing "around the world in 80 days" whenever ben gets back from class... woohoo. =P  later dudes =P
