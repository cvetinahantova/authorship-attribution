I had a good time tonight with D-bo.  We went out for Pizza and saw Jermaine there.  He is tuly the most electrified man in all of the Fredonia Pizza circles!  D-bo and I got talking and ended up on the meaning of the Jar of Flies title to an Alice in Chains Album.  Here's a clip from an interview with AIC former front man Layne Staley with Hit Parader.  HP: First off, where did the title Jar Of Flies come from?   LS: It came from a science experiment (AIC guitarist) Jerry Cantrell did  when he was in the third grade. They gave him two jars full of flies.  One of the jars they overfed, the other jar they underfed. The one they  overfed flourished for a while, then all the flies died from  overpopulation. The one they underfed had most of the flies survive all  year. I guess there's a message in there somewhere. Evidently that  experiment had a big impact on Jerry.
