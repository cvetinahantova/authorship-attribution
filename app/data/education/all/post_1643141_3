Got to page 16, and decided I had wasted $14.  What can I say about this book:  A TOTAL PIECE OF UNACADEMIC CRAP.  Supposed to be a linguistics book, it's written in a rather unorthodox way.  First, how many academians, or people interested in this book, would actually know anything about "Moe the Bartender" ( The Simpsons ) and his idiosyncratic use of speech.  Then, it's written for a typical American (a.k.a. monolingual) in complete disregard to the reverence and respect that should be given to other older languages, like those stemming from Latin.  Furthermore, it characterizes a misrepresentation of the spoken word in other languages with phonetic spellings that should be accurate, yet represent sounds that do not exist in English, therefore degrading the quality of a language that may have been spoken for thousands of centuries.   
 
I positively cannot understand why anyone would bother to write a book that makes him seem like an ignorant linguist-wanna-be, after working so long on achieving a Ph.D., and thus making the bestowing institution reconsider their original decision - but to no avail.  Mr. McWhorter should have been a comedian instead.  It was trully disappointing to find that a publishing company out there disgraced itself by publishing this book; on the other hand, I am glad it was not the publishing house of an academic institution.  Nevertheless, books like this one should never hit the shelves.
