Today was the day of shitty tips.  It was steady all day, but a few tables stuck out in my mind.  First, there was a table of 4 fat white-trash types.  They ordered a bunch of food, and ran my ass ragged for their ranch dressing for their chicken quesadillas (I know, doesn't sound like the most appetizing of choices).  The bill came to $39 and change.  They left me $42 and exact change.  People like that piss me off.  Then came the group from WalMart... a couple of hours late.  I was really good about getting their food and serving them quickly.  Their bill came to almost $80, but they only left me $10.  Bastards.  Thankfully, the people tipping 20% or higher made up for it.  Tomorrow night I work the Kareoke.  I think there's two waitresses on, but I should rake in a decent amount of cash. I also forgot to clock out.  But I remembered that I didn't clock out and called them up and told them.  What a tiring day!  I probably won't post tomorrow, but I'm sure I'll have interesting stories for Saturday.
