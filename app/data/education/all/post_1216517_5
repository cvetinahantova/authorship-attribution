DON'T DRINK THE WATER I guess   urlLink Christina Aguilera  was at  urlLink the guys  show last night.  That's pretty fun.  Mike wanted to make out with her.  Good thing I wasn't at the show, cuz she'd have been all over me, and then the  urlLink Secret Service  who have gotten involved and that would have been a big mess.  I just want things to go smoothly for the guy.  The last thing they want it me making a big disturbance at one of their shows.  It's hard though, because I'm in the business of disturbance.  The recent events in the world remind me of an incident in particular:  I was in   urlLink Amman, Jordan  in '95 with  urlLink TMI .  We had just been in the West Bank.  While there we filled up water bottles with water from the Jordan River to take home.  In Amman, we were all hanging out in a room on the 7th floor of this hotel.  I was thirsty and took a sip of water from what i thought was a bottle of fresh sping water.  It wasn't.  It was from the muddy Jordan.  Me , being the jokester I am, ran to the window stuck my head out, and made a gagging noise.  Well, there was some kind of street vendor down that apparently thought i was gagging at him.  He shouted something back at me in Arabic.  I thought that was really funny so i gagged at him again, then i gathered everybody in the room to watch and I gagged at him a 3rd time.   Well, now looking back on the situation 8 years later, I can honestly say that there are worse things that Americans can do to Arabs than gag at them, but i can't think of any right now. Oh, the aftermath of the story is that I am THE major impediment for US-Arab relations for the past decade.  I claim responsibility.  I won't deny it.  But it doesn't bother me.  You would have done the same thing if you drank the water.
