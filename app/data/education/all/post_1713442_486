urlLink Narrative and Stories in Adult Teaching and Learning. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Marsha Rossiter.  It examines the use of stories in teaching adults.  From the ERIC Digest:  Narrative and stories in education have been the focus of increasing attention in recent years. The idea of narrative is fertile ground for adult educators who know intuitively the value of stories in teaching and learning. Narrative is deeply appealing and richly satisfying to the human soul, with an allure that transcends cultures, centuries, ideologies, and academic disciplines. In connection with adult education, narrative can be understood as an orientation that carries with it implications for both method and content. This Digest presents a brief overview of a narrative orientation to teaching and learning and then explores how stories and autobiographical writing promote learning.
