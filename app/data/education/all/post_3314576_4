Yesterday....... or maybe it was the day before.... I went driving with one of my friends.  We were driving to just enjoy the night and the gorgeous weather-- we were also going to go see this lake that is about 20 minutes away.  The road was narrow and winding, the trees had so many different colors of green-- I think even more greens than in my crayon box.  Sometimes I wonder:  How can you experience such awesome things in nature and  not  believe in God?
