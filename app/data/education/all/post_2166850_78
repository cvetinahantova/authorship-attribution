today was when joshua tian, a youth serving one in my church group, got married to sis. zoe, who also serves the youth group. i was kind of happy for them, especially since i've not seen bro joshua look so happy before.  i fixed the computer so that the sound works again! yay! i heard  autobiography  by  ashlee simpson . it's really good. the track i'm playing is  pieces of me  by her too, my favourite song for the time being.  please pray for my piano exam on tuesday, coz its gonna be a tough one. my scales are so darn bad. and my flute is kinda screwed up too. my tone is so down in the dumps and my scales basically suck too.  syf was last wednesday. after the performance, i went for haagen daz with ivan cheng, chee jun, kevin ho and jefferson. i bought the cheapest thing there. and it cost me $8.90...well. i have a sore throat now from eating mooncake. yeuuggh.  two more days to resume boarding school residence and im having mixed feelings about it. i go there, and i lose weight, have morning swimming trainings before school and morning revivals with my church pals, but i stay at home and have time to practise my music, have more internet time and get to see my family. so there's pros and cons.  i also managed to get ac idol tix from kenneth khing. yay! btw his blog's name is bigbloodybloggyblog or something like that. yeah.  yeah well thats about it. i guess i shall say more tomorrow. possibly. byez!  -ting-
