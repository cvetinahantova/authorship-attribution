George Washington was the first president.  He led some wars.  Started up government from scratch... and made us America.  Lincoln ended slavery.  Andrew Jackson was... I bet many don't even remember what he did.  Did he do anything?  Hamilton?  Who the?  What?  Oh... It's pretty sad when most people can't identify with the people on their own currency.  You know why people like state quarters?  It gives them a reason to be proud.  America's a gimmick.  Home of the Brave...Land of the Free... Everything in America has to have meaning.  Putting new people on money would give meaning.  And yes, no one dealt with terror, gun control, pollution, etc...Why?  They were too busy exploring lands, fighting over it, and slaughtering natives.
