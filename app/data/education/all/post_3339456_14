The US has dropped the resolution that would allow immunity for US soldiers on a UN peacekeeping force.  This is a small victory for international peace and justice.    However, it seems that quite a few hawks are using the occasion to rip into the UN, claiming that the UN has no place talking about the primacy of law in light of the oil-for-food program scandal.  For the uninformed, there are accusations that a number of people, including Kofi Annan's own son, and a hand-picked official, were involved in a scandal with money and weapons as the commodities, and the other party was Saddam Hussein.  Neocons have taken the opportunity to rip into Annan and the UN.     Kofi Annan set up an independent investigation of the program, approved by the security council, and headed by the former US official Paul Volcker.    The neoconservative  urlLink Heritage Foundation  says that Security Council ought to investigate the overseeing of the program by Annan.  Wrong.  Not only did the  urlLink security council oversee the program , but  urlLink Britain and the United States  saw every contract that was approved.  The Global Policy Forum has a  urlLink link page  with a brief introduction, and a number of articles related to this issue.    If you are receiving false information from the neoconservative right on this issue, please educate yourself so we can defeat this tactic that is a political power play intended to distract us from the real abhorrences, which are the US attacks, occupations, and human rights abuses in Iraq.
