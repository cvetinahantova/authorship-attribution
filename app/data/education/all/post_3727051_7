urlLink    This is one of my very best cross stitch finishes.  I enjoyed stitching this, and enjoyed even more sending it off to be finished by a wonderful lady named Judy O'Dell.  It sits on our mantle, and I change the flowers for the seasons - it looks really cool with the Christmas decorations!Â  urlLink
