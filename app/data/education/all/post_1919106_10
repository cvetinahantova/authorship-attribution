Shinies!   Weee... today at work a part of our orders came in. Four spanking-new Dell rackmount servers with 2.something Ghz Pentium IV Xeon processors, gigabytes of RAM, hot-swappable drives, gigabit Ethernet, and shiny LEDs.  We also got 2 UPSs, which can handle 3000 W each, but we're worried that the power grid on the building may not be able to handle them (which is also going to be a problem for the servers, because each server has at least a 500 W power supply) so we need to get someone from physical plant over to survey the power grid and give it an a-ok before we do anything.  Not everything is rosy color either... the machines come with RedHat Linux installed, which I don't like, so I'm going to have to install Debian Linux on them... and we were intending on adding serial ATA drives to expand the storage capacity of the servers, but there are no power connectors for those on the servers... maybe external sATA drives?
