Oh my gawd! I just did a search fionski using google and I can't believe I have a name sake here, she happens to be a Filipina too! Good grief! I thought I was the only fionski in the whole wide world, well there's another one in livejournal but she's Polish I think. Been doing the search weekly, new fionski is new! Is she as old as I am? Has she been using fionski longer than I have? Is she as pretty as me? Well, she has to be pretty, she's my namesake!! There goes my identity...  *sigh*
