I haven't quite figured out the AV.  It's filled with Yuppies from LA that moved out there because it's cheaper.  You've got the rednecks.  And the people that hate it here and want to leave.  It's  nice mix.  There's one thing they all have in common:  They're all terrible drivers.   They poke the noses of their cars out in traffic, drive 10 mph below the limit, swerve.  It's good times.  The Tigers need to win.  They are 0-7.    I used to think Jim Rome was cool.   urlLink Now  I hate him.  He is number one on my worse person ever list.  Well above Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Hitler, Stalin, Saddam and all female "commedians."  Anyone that likes Rome is dumb.
