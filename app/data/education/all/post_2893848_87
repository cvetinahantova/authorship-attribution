i will go on record    i will go on record now to state that should pete's bo sox somehow manage to defeat my cubbies in next fall's world series, i will purchase pete a tasty all you can eat chicken  urlLink meal  at Boston Market. however, if and when the cubs mop the floor with NO-MAH and pals, i propose pete take me out for a dinner at lawry's steakhouse, the finest steakhouse in the land, right here in chicago. the discrepancy between the prices of these meals is due to the fact that the bo sox are allowed to use a  urlLink designated hitter  throughout their season. that's only fair. what'dya say pete?
