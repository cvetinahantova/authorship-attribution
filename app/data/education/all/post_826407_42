Been struggling a lot with questions about belief recently, so I thought it would be a good exercise to re-visit what I do believe.  Write a creed I suppose,  so here goes....  I believe that God is a personality with characteristics that can be known (to a point).  I believe that God chose to be like us and visited earth for while.  While he was here he asked a lot of questions, laid out some guidelines and then sacrificed himself so we'd have a hope of following him.  I believe that God is still present and active in the world in many ways, some of which we have seen, some of which we can't.  Some characteristics of God I think I've discovered are...                                       Holiness - There is a standard of perfection, it is God                   Justice - Things are wrong and need to be put right                   Mercy - Even though things are wrong its better to let people off as much as possible than to judge them                    Grace - People are people, they need space to grow and god gives these to us all                   Redemption - Nothing is beyond hope, people, communities and the world can still be saved                          Love - People need it and its stronger than death   I believe these things can be learned and practiced in my own life.  There, its a bit messy and tentative but then can the story of God and people be reduced into nice simple points?  I'm not sure.
