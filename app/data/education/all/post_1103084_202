.................................................................. my grand theory of the universe is falsifiable. ..................................................................  which, i guess, according to my training, makes it a good theory. if grand theories of the universe can ever be good theories.    so what is my g.t.o.t.u.?   i've already shared it here a couple of times, but i've honed the wording a little bit.  i'm still waiting for the stream of comments to barrage me with reasons it isn't true or instances where it isn't true, but so far nothing.  here it is:    People make most of their decisions because they believe their choices will salve their greatest wounds.    that's it.   it's a theory of human motivation. which seems essential to any of us who ever want to inspire / persuade / understand / study / enlighten / enliven / liberate / titilate / entertain / educate other people. right? can't do any of those without understanding motivation.  but i was saying that i discovered its falsifiability.   children.   i know that i'm constantly blogging about my children which makes me categorically unhip.  parenting just reeks of anti-cool, but....  i gotta say...  children don't have to live in response to their greatest wounds, because their greatest wounds haven't emerged yet.  They're able to live much more in the immediate present.  I already sense that Jaelyn is developing a sense of how the world responds to her -- and embedded in that sense (for all of us) is an understanding of the world's limitations, betrayals and cruelties:  the incipient wounds which will scar us throughout our development....  but its nice that they're not poured in concrete yet.   i have a related question, too.  is a person's level-of-reflectiveness affect how aware they are of their wounds (and therefore how stable their wounds are)?  peace~
