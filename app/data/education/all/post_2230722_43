According to Vh1's "Best Month Ever" show, the cowboy from 70's disco gay super-group The Village People has married. What, didn't know the VP were gay?  A little googling revealed this AP article:   NEW YORK - The cowboy from the Village People has gotten married. MTV News reports Randy Jones married acid lounge artist Will Grega Friday at a New York club.   Grega and Jones have been together for 20 years. Grega proposed that night and they were married on the spot.   Gay marriage is still illegal in New York state, but Jones says, "It's only a matter of time before the courts rule in favor of what's morally right and humanly decent." Grega, meanwhile, points out, "I have a lifetime membership to the YMCA."   It kills me not knowing if the perennially favorite wedding reception song "YMCA" was used for the happy copule.
