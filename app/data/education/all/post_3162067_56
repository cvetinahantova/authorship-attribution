It has been such a lovely day today. Kids being sooo nice to me. I got a birthday card from Sarah A, who is a darling and it touched me, and also a bunch of flowers from two pupils who were late back from lunch and bought me them as an apology. Nicked, no doubt, but it made me smile a lot. I also got some gorgeous pressies from the English crew: this most elegant notepad (from Monsoon!!!!!!) and a really cool rat model (although, due to the spikes it has, I wasn't entirely sure what it was at first). So thoughtful. Plus a beautiful card made by Kathryn: she is so talented, they are absolute works of art and it has taken pride f place on my mantel. I'm going out for a drink with some of the crew tonight (although not the English dep.) and that means I will not see my baby for a few hours. So darling, duckling, I love you more with the passing of each day, and I long to hold you in my arms when I return. Miss you, love you, forever xxxxxx And get well soon Ally-pally.
