All The Young Punks   Recently, I invested in a  urlLink CMJ  subscription because I wasn't buying any new music.  Sure,  urlLink Donovan ,  urlLink Sabbath  and  urlLink Nick Lowe  all rock like babies cry, but I was starting to miss being part of a scene, god knows why, and as great as it may be, the  urlLink ICPL  just isn't Max's Kansas City.  I got the first issue today.  Man.  I knew I'd have to wade through shit, I just didn't know it would be up past my knees.  There's some good music on the cd, and I don't regret the subscription (yet) but it's all so infernally precocious.  Two ideas occur to me:    1)  my previous idea about the appearance of individuality coming to replace actual individuality has never found more support than in the glossy photos of  urlLink up and coming indie rockers  doing their best to look both earnest and unlike each other (rampant androgyny complicates this effort, amusingly).  Even when they look like  urlLink math nerds , it's a fucking statement.   2)  I'm too young to be a curmudgeon.  And yet, here I am.  Where's a  urlLink snowglobe  when you need one?
