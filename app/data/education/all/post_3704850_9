If you look at  urlLink test.php , you'll notice I did a test migration from InDesign to BBEdit.  This set of steps seems to be the best to ensure no problems moving back and forth:    Select all of the text you wish to copy from Larry's text version of the catalog.   Open  urlLink stationary.php . This will create a blank document with the structure you need.   Paste the code into the page and change the  body id .   Structure the text as follows:   h1  for the topmost line    h2  is slightly smaller and italicized.  It is not used much    h3  for the subheadings that break from paragraphs    h4  also for subheadings that break from paragraphs, only smaller    b  denotes a subhead that does not break from a paragraph. It has a negative margin in order to remove paragraph indentation.   Use  em ,  strong  and  cite  for all other inline styling.   Use  abbr  and  . These tags assist the disabled. The first appearance an abbreviation or acronym tag should also contain the  title  attribute explaining the full word (e.g.  <acronym title="Alma College Otaku and Gamers">ACOG</acronym>  )   Images should have the  src ,  alt ,  height ,  width  attributes. Graphics that explain or represent something should also inlude  longdesc="longdescs.php#[filename]"  attributes. The image should also be linked with a  title="Extended Description" . Example:  <a title="Image Description" href="longdescs.php#Guide-to-Course-Listings"><img src="images/Guide-to-Course-Listings.gif" alt="Guide to Course Listsings. Click for an extended description." longdesc="longdescs.php#Guide-to-Course-Listings" width="641" heigth="414" /></a>    Tables should use columns, column groups, row groups, headers, captions and the  summary  and  scope  attributes where appropriate (ask if you don't know).  This may seem tedious, but once again we want Alma to be friendly to the disabled and comply with  US  Section 508 and  WCAG  1.0.     Make sure all inappropriate entities are removed.
