TFTC Stop CAFTA Update 	By glencanyon@comcast.net  -  In this message:  1.  Press Release calling on Congress to vote NO on CAFTA   **************************** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 28, 2004 Contact: Lesley Ramsey, (512) 507-4185  Coalition calls on Texas Congressional delegation to vote NO on CAFTA  (AUSTIN) Today, as President Bush signs the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in Washington D.C., a statewide coalition of fair trade advocates in Texas is calling on members of Congress to commit now to voting NO on the agreement.  CAFTA is a regional agreement between the U.S. and five Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the negotiations for the terms of which concluded in December 2003. The Dominican Republic was also "docked" onto the agreement.  �First and foremost, we see CAFTA as a referendum on NAFTA,� said Lesley Ramsey, director of the Texas Fair Trade Coalition. �After 10 years of NAFTA, we know firsthand the devastating effects of this policy on working people everywhere. We will NOT support its expansion.  �Second, CAFTA fails to meet any of the baseline requirements for a FAIR trade agreement:  �      It does NOT include adequate enforcement for violations of internationally recognized labor and environmental standards;  �      It allows foreign corporations to bring actions against governments that pass labor, public health or environmental laws that reduce corporate profits, as they are allowed to do under NAFTA Chapter 11; and  �      It includes rules that promote privatization and deregulation of services including education, health care, postal service, construction, transportation and water supply.  Finally, CAFTA is a crucial step toward the even more dangerous Free Trade Area of the Americas--which the Bush administration hopes to finish negotiating this year.  Based on the NAFTA model, CAFTA would push ahead the corporate globalization agenda that has caused a "race to the bottom" in labor and environmental standards in the U.S. and Central America. CAFTA would also include services provisions promoting the privatization and deregulation of fundamental public services.    In addition, CAFTA would remove all tariff barriers in the five Central American countries on imported agricultural products. This would allow cheaply grown and heavily subsidized U.S. corn and other basic grains to flood local markets (subsidies that almost exclusively benefit giant agribusiness in the U.S.). Small farmers in Central America, already devastated by the importation of cheaply grown agribusiness U.S. grains, years of drought, and the massive fall of coffee prices on the world market, would face the extinction of their livelihoods. CAFTA would likely force a massive migration of erstwhile farmers to large urban areas to work in the informal sector or maquilas (sweatshops), or to risk a dangerous journey to seek work in the U.S.  The Administration's push to implement CAFTA is part of a strategy for an expanded and equally flawed trade agreement, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) which would cover all of North, Central, and South America except Cuba.   The Texas Fair Trade Coalition is a statewide coalition of labor, environmental organizations, family farmers, religious groups and other social justice organizations working together for economic fairness in trade policy.
