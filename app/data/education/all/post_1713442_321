urlLink History of Nations  This is a site which has brief histories of every nation in the world.  It looks like a nice reference resource.  I am sure that school children all over the world will cut-and-paste this resource extensively as they write papers. I fished around and it looks like the information was taken from the US State Department with a lot of new content blended in.  Here are a few examples:   urlLink History of Egypt   urlLink History of Israel   urlLink History of Costa Rica   urlLink History of Vanuata   urlLink History of Brazil
