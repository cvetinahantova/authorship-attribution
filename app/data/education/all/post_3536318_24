Someone wrote a comment the other day... Someone I don't know personally... Someone I don't even think my friends or family know personally...  That can only mean one thing...  Someone besides my sister and my brother read this trash!!!  To make it even cooler: Someone I don't even know!  I suppose I better step up the pace of these blog entries... Yes.. Ok.. and step up the quality of them too.  I have a public to entertain!!!   (Oh, and if you know the guy, and it turns out he's actually my best friend from home, don't tell me just yet... I'm living in my own dream world.  urlLink Marie  has  urlLink MPERIA  and the #1 slot,  urlLink Chris  has the Writer that wants him to review his book,  urlLink Mike  has been seen by millions on the silver screen, I have some guy from Canada who stumbled upon my blog.)  Life is good.
