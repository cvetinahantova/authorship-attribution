In order to fulfill one of my goals, I read a lot of books recently. I read a book called  urlLink 'The happiness six years ' (The first and second pics) when I was on the bus to Central. I could barely hold my tears while I was reading it.  I have never been touched so much in my life.  The book is a Japanese mother's diary, dedicated to her Down's Syndrome son, 'autumn snow'. He was diagnosed 'couldn't live longer than 12 months'. However, with the love of his parents, teachers and doctors, autumn snow passed away at the age of six.  What touched me most is her attitude. She loves him as a whole. She didn't love him less or reserve her love for he's not a perfect, or just, normal kid. She knew that her beloved son might leave her at any moment and yet, she filled his short little life with love and wonderful experiences.  Living in such a fast globalizing world, do we know where's our stance? Do we simply follow the trend or, do we know what we are doing and why we do that? Explanation is the glamorous clothes of cover.  Be honest to your feeling and safeguard your stance.  I have seen love and courage in this Japanese mother. She followed her heart and has her stance. Though the result was not of her desire, she didn't betray her feelings. She wasn't controlled by the situation, she proactively controlled it.  Her son is the luckiest little guy in the world. He has experienced love and courage from his parents, which many people can't, don't or haven't experienced in their lives. His short visit has not only enlightened his parents, but also a HK reader.
