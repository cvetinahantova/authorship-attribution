Who goes to the library on Valentine's Day?  Me.  ha.  I love the library, what can I say.  The other day at school sucked.  I wanted to kill all the children in class.  but I didn't.  unfortunately.  I got more comments of who I look like though:  some kid from Jurrasic Park 3, some kid from Tarzan the Disney animated feature, Jack Osbourne, and the lead singer for Incubus.  Right.  I saw 'City of God'  the other day.  I'm still reeling from it.  I'll talk more about it later, but it was incredible.    A quick review of my favorite movies I've seen this past year: -American Splendor -City of God -Pirates of the Carribean -Big Fish -The Bourne Identity  Might as well do CD's I've bought as well: -Sam Roberts "We were born in a flame" -Dandy Warhols "13 tales from urban bohemia" -Wilco "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" -Coldplay "Rush of blood to the head" -Beck "Sea Change" -Flaming lips "Yoshimi..." -Oasis "What's the story..." -Oasis...  ok, actually I've bought every Oasis cd ever made this past year and I love them all, so, yeah.  anyway.  I'm done.
