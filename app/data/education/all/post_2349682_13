Well we are off to a wonderful week so far! I can't believe it is already December. My mother surprised us all yesterday by taking out the tree (artifical), putting up the lights, and decorating the house! Last year we didn't put up the tree till a couple of days before Christmas, I like this way though because I am actually looking forward to Christmas this year. I took my grandparent's out for lunch today, I called my grandma last week to see if she was available today and she didn't even look at her calendar she says, "is 11:30 good for you?"hee hee. We went to Souper Salad which is one of their favorite places to eat. My grandpa kept saying, God has a special place in heaven for you Cela. I didn't want to be like I know he does and get all prideful, ya know? I just smiled and said that taking them out to eat is just something that I like doing, he was fine with that answer. It made me think though, is there things in my life that I do just to say I do stuff like that? For instance do I nanny or take care of kids to make myself look good or to build myself up? Or do I help out with things at church or the youth just to say that I am on a ministry team? I hope not, that to me seems like I think I am all that and more and that's not at all what I am trying to say. I just want to do what God wants me to do in my life, and right now those things are what's in my life. I really don't want it to be about me, I am just trying to do what God does, bless his children! Besides working with youth and kids is a very humbling experience because you can't get away with anything, they will tell you how it is whenever they feel like it! Grandparent's do that too. And when I find myself getting prideful or whatever God is always there to gently remind me, "honey it is so not about you! (hee hee) It's so all about me, give the credit where the credit is due! I love you silly girl!" I love God for that reason.
