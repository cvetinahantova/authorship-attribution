Ok so I have been convinced by my good friend Beth that I too should create a blog just like everyone else.....so here I am, creating one....Thanks Beth (www.nurseslife.blogspot.com).  Little plug for Betheroo.  I decided that of course I need one more way to waste time at work!!  Because apparently aim, okayamigo, online shopping, random online searches, and just plain chatting with the other girls at work just isn't enough for me anymore.  Don't you have work to do you might ask...and the answer is why yes I do.  However it is very easy and I have to make it seem like it is hard for me so I don't get given anymore.  LOL.  No really tho, I do work hard.  It's just that on my "off" weeks I am less stressed and usually feel that I deserve a break, so I play.  Oh, and for those who don't already know I'm a trainer for a franchising company, I won't name any names.. ;), and I teach training classes every other week usually.  So an "off" week just means I'm not teaching the el stupidos that week.  I however should have very funny posts up on the training weeks, because this will be where I vent all my frustrations and tell the world the stupid stuff that happens to me.  I know everyone is very excited now.  Ok so this will be a short post because number a. I don't have that much to say yet and letter b. the computer erased the first draft I had!!!  BLAH.  So I had to quickly make a new, considering my lunch break is over and has been for about 15 min. Oh well.  I'll probably post again later this afternoon.  ttyl.
