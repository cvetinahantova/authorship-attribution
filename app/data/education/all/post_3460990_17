Listening to Ace of Base whilst I rapidly prepare for Spring Visit AND an impending new roomie (hiding all my dark secrets, hahaha).   Today was a crazy day at work. For the next 11 workdays, I'll still be sitting behind the front desk at  urlLink AWED . We just got 3 new interns, who seem quite motivated and intelligent. Therefore, we aren't exactly sure what to do with them (one only needs so many copies made). When I leave, they'll be covering my desk in shifts while work figures out what to do. So, I'm trying to do all my regular work stuff, plus train the interns while attempting to make a "Bible" for the desk, so whoever sits there eventually will be able to cope. I was soo glad when the clock read 5:30.  On the way home, I stopped by Petite Sophisticate (read:"mature" clothing) and got a "don't I look professional?" black bag that's big enough to hold a file folder stuffed with all the Fellows documentation I need to tote around to interviews. Okay, so I couldn't resist...I also got a teacher outfit. Black skirt, lavender twin set. Not flashy, but it really makes me look like a grown up, especially with my hair cut. (On that subject, a student who came into my work told me it made me look "like a lady". Not sure how exactly to take that.)  My home life is still in flux, with the roommate still avoiding me. However, the kittens are, as always, a joy. Sydney is bouncing around in the newly aquired shopping bag and appears to be happy as can be. (Ah, simple pleasures!) Lena is watching, but I can tell anym minute now she'll be fast asleep on the table. As I was reading  The Life of Pi , one word really made me smile. The boy, Pi, came upon an island, inhabited by not just meerkats, but meer kittens ! Meerkittens! What a great word.
