Duke. And what 's her history?             Vio. A blank, my lord. She never told her love,                 But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,                Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,                 And with a green and yellow melancholy                She sat like patience on a monument,                Smiling at grief. 			--William Shakespeare 			  Twelfth Night          "It was inevitable: The scent of bitter almonds always  reminded him of the fate of unrequited love."                     --Gabriel Garcia Marquez          	Love in the Time of Cholera   It happens with food.     Lesson One  At lunch: If a little hungry while waiting for your best friend to be through with her psychology class, and an all too familiar face finds you out side a dull college cafeteria, be sure to sit with him after he persuades you to "try the gourmet food line."  You will find his proposal on secluded patio dining quite intimate.  The first time will not be the last.     A. appetizer and drinks .   After you are seated, it is possible that you may have trouble with your hands; if you do not know where to place them as he tells you about a dream he had of Trotsky, try running your fingers through your hair.  Or, you may want to pick at the cherry tomato in your salad as he inquires about your weekend; when telling him, “so much can happen in two days,” to avoid all choking hazards, be sure to swallow the tomato bit before he replies, “So much can happen in twenty minutes.”     On  cold days , rely on your Styrofoam cup filled with hot constant comment tea should you find his lingering glance too intense.  You should be able to sustain any emotional fall out while shifting your eyes from his eyes to the white cup.  To avoid biting down at the cup’s edge, lick your lips, smile, and employ your infectious cheer.    On  warm days , it is best to chew the crushed ice in your tea when an awkward pause occurs.  Remember, this too shall pass; soon, he will put you at ease and on edge as he suggests more exotic, moist, places for vacation such as a stroll through the Amazon Jungle where serious allergic reactions to beautifully flowering plants are not uncommon, or maybe a little R& R in a café in Ecuador, smoking and drinking with friends.    And when the need arises for an extended vacation, such as a vow to be out of the country during a presidential inauguration, you will find his pitch for a trek through Mexico more than advantageous.  After all, cycle tours in Europe are all too common, and it is much better to be an "Anarchist at heart."  But if in the mood for places closer to home, he may recommend an airy walk on San Diego’s infamous Black’s beach, or because you have an affinity for flowers, you might prefer a little visit to the Anza Borrego desert, or Joshua Tree being that “the blossoms will be extremely beautiful from all of the rain.”    Or perhaps even better, a trip to New Orleans, since you are French, and would really enjoy the "Franco-Spanish influence," and the dark smoky bars awakened by the Jazz festival. Certainly, one of the many used bookstores might permit you to rescue a real keeper—an old copy of Neruda’s, “Twenty love songs and a song of despair.” Knowing that this poet is new to you, and you just love Neruda, he might even lend it to you; well, that is "if you can be nice," and if, he remembers to bring it.             Still if there is an absence of cash flow and time, you might give serious thought to his preference for “The back road to Taos.”  Indeed, the direct route is certainly less romantic and less interesting when traveling with the wrong person.    But if it is just a setting sun you are after, you don't have far to go. After expressing how you “love the view of the volcanoes on the west side of Albuquerque,” he will not hesitate to inform you of his frequent rides up to the volcanoes, where he enjoys "sitting there, seeing the pink, peach, and pale blue sky, while watching the sun go down."  When hearing his romantic sunset phrasing, avoid all fidgeting with clothes, and earrings.  Also, take caution: if holding a drink, you are prone to spill it on your salad which you have barely eaten, or on your dress.   Under no circumstances, get ahead of yourself; this is only the beginning.  For there are still many discourses on sunsets to come, and as he will assert again and again, “There’s nothing wrong with flirting...”    Tomorrow--Now You're Talking: Proper Lunch conversation.
