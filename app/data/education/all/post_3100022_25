Rachelle has asked for her username and password for the blogger (Finally) so hopefully we will start to see some diary entries from her too. I spoke to Rachelle the other day, she seems be getting in to the swing of things, and is starting enjoy her job a little more, which is a good thing!  I'm really tired right now, last night I did not get a very good sleep, as I had taken some Gurana (herbal, energy pill, seed extract from caffeine related plant, available from most health stores) but got knocked off early so I had quite a restless sleep.  I went clubbing in reading for the first time the other night, it was a Monday so it was fairly quiet but pretty much the clubs in reading are very similar to those in N.Z I am yet to experience the awesomness of the London City Night Clubs.
