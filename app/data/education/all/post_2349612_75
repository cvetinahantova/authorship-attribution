so, walking to class this morning, i caught a glimpse of my reflection in a glass door i was going through.  this is a busy (and thus stressful) week so i wasn't looking (or feeling) too overjoyed,... however, the expression in my eyes was *exactly* the look nicole used to give me when i had just said something *completely* ridiculous.... for that i just *had* to laugh. =)  duuuude.  hard to believe she's already been gone 6 months next week...
