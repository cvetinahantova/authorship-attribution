Saw Terminator 3 last night.  It was ok.  The audi for my HBO is horrible though.  Why am I paying for this thing if tt doesn't work?  I'm getting hungry.  What to make for dinner, I wonder.  I'll think about it more.  Yesterday me and my friends were talking about people in sucky relationships.  we've come to the realization that it's all about denial, and beleiving that things will be different for someone dating an asshole.  Go figure.  Little bits of life, eh.
