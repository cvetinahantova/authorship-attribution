Listening to: cars passing in  the street below Mood: Content  I haven't written in a few days because I haven't felt the need to, to be honest. I don't feel the need to now, but before my inbox gets full of preocuped friends, I'll fill you in very briefly. I had another accident on Monday. No casualties, but a bit of a nightmare to say the least. Shit still is happening with ' friends '.  X  and I are fine... well actually beyond fine.  And now I'm waiting for the  LOML  to arrive so that we can go and spend an enjoyable weekend away.  HASTA  PS: D keep me informed.
