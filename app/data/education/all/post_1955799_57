Oh,  I've been so lazy, but with good reason.  I took some time off to rest.  My holiday time at work has started, and I feel relaxed.  I wanted to write something that is not on paper.  LOL  I hope to write more frequent.    I downloaded Netscape from a disk that gave me demos for dremweaver and fireworks.  Hopefully I'll redo my hompage, cause it looks crappy.  LOL
