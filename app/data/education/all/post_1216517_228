Hey guys, I just finished  The Idiot  by Dostoevsky. Good book. It was a long read, and it tied together in the end with a lot of unanswered/unanswerable questions. Jesse, glad to hear that things are going well in Hawii. The sea urchin thing is a bummer. Anyone up for a weekend camping trip in the near future?
