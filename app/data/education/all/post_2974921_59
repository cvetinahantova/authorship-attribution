is it just me or jammi? i don't get it why i just can't miss him the way i missed JP. it's like, jammi and i are just friends, like me and daryl not talking for a while. dammit!   i really feel glad about monique though. i'm glad i'm helping her [i think] with her boyfriend secrecy problem. i could relate [big time]. i guess this advice thing isn't such a bad idea.   *** i met this guy through the rock chatroom earlier. he's nicolo, 20, from cebu. kind of rockerish and he smokes weed[cool!]. he was nice and he said i was funny! hehe....  *** i miss lyle. not in a loving way, more like "aww...crap lost another bud" way...^_^
