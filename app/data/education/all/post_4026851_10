Never fails.  Doing late-night laps with the remote, and yet again, I stop to be mesmerized by conveyor belts on channel 40-- The Food Network's  Unwrapped .  Tonight, Marc Summers is educating me on how old-time kettle chips are making a (hardy-har) "cracklin' comeback."   I'm guessing that the trance-like state induced by this show is a subconscious nostalgia craving.  Mister Fred Rogers was a boyhood hero of mine.  I tuned in daily, not for want of "speedy deliveries" or trolley rides to poorly-voiced make-believe land-- but for the feeding of the fish.  I had a passion for watching him feed his fish.  Maybe because I never fed my own fish.    I was also a  huuuge  fan of Mister Rogers' wallmounted flatscreen television.  He was the first, folks.  It even had a screensaver, remember?  It's a crappy painting one moment... then a swirl later, presto!  We're following Fred through the Crayola factory and our five year-old minds are being floored by the whole process.  Age 11-- and my afterschool TV guilty pleasure is the Marc Summers' hosted  Double Dare .  Game show... families... trivia... "physical challenges"... obstacle course!  Moms and dads digging through giant, green-slime-filled nostrils for red flags and fabulous prizes!  Loved it.  Now... if only Marc would waltz into that diner at the beginning of every show and "unwrap" his wardrobe.    And change into a hoodie and loafers.    Pervert.
