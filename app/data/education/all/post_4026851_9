Been talking to my brother on AIM about the fling he had in New Orleans last weekend... the fling he had while I sat by the hotel room door in the hallway at 4am waiting for him to zip up or roll off or whatever else had to be accomplished...    We've been mulling the object of the conquest's proper nomenclature.  The standard, "is she a slut, or just a chick that likes to bang (nothing wrong with that)?" debate.   Tangential epiphany I had-- where does this word "slut" originate?  Looks like a blend word, right?   Slit = slit + rut.   Consider yourselves enlightened.
