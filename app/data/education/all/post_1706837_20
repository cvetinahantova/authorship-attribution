Last night, I went to Archambault (remember from my other post? its the music store? yes. now you remember.) with Chris and Matt. It was semi-fun, but really it wasnt (it was just an opportunity to get off the campus again). We spent an hour and a half waiting for the second bus, because the bus system here is stupid, but again, we were away from the campus, so that was fine!      This morning was our last class, and it was fairly boring, mainly because everyone was  SO TIRED . We played some moderately amusing games, but that was about it. This afternoon is our class presentation... all the classes have one... i think ours will be one of the best, because we have been working on it for a while, and some people were still making it up today. Tonight there are a bunch of us going to a restaurant called the Yellow Tomato for a nice supper (we reserved an entire floor). Tomorrow morning is our final exam, and then our class is having a little party outside (with donuts!!) LOL. After that, we have to clean our rooms and finish packing (im did most of mine last night... just the thigns i need to use are left) and at 4:30 we leave for the Gala (its at a hotel about 30 minutes away. we leave at 4:30 and get back at 2ish)... then we are going to stay up all night long, eat breakfast, and leave for the train station at noon. we'll be in Ottawa at 6:22, so i'll be home by 7:30 :(      This is the last time i'll be on the internet before i leave, so this is my last post from Qu√©bec. When i get back, I'll update on all the things i do in the next two days. I can't believe its been 32 days already... i will miss everybody! See everyone in Renfrew again soon. Au revoir!
