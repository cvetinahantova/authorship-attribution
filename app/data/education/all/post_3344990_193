Chapter 38- The Great Commission is my commission     Verse to remember- Send us around the world with the news of your saving power and your eternal plan for all mankind. Psalm 67:2    Question to consider - what steps can I take to prepare to go on a short term missions experience in the next year?   In reality that happening in the next year is slim to none. Once Katy and I have full time jobs with vacation time after one year of service then we could think about this.    Chapter 39- Blessed to be balanced    Verse to remember- life life with a due sense of responsibility, not as those that do not know the meaning of life but as those who do. Eph 5:15    Question to consider- Which of the 4 activities will I begin in order to stay on track and balance Gods five purposes in my life?    The 5 purposes were:   	 Practiced by the first Christians in Acts chapter 2 	Explained by Paul in Ephesians 4 	Modeled by Jesus in John 17 	Summarized in the Great Commandment and the Great Commission by Jesus    Gods 5 purposes for your life are:   	 Love God with all your heart  (worship) 	Love your neighbor as yourself (ministry) 	Go and make disciples (evangelism) 	Baptize them into  (fellowship) 	Teach them to do all things (discipleship)     "A great commitment to the great commandment and the great commission will make you a great Christian"   Practice the following four habits   	Talk it through with a spiritual partner or small group 	Give yourself a regular spiritual check up 	Write down your progress in a journal 	Pass on what you learn to others    I need to start doing habits 1 and 3 on a regular basis. I already practice habits 2 and 4.  I need to email Rick Warren at free@purposedrivenlife.com and ask for ALL of the free resources listed on page 324.
