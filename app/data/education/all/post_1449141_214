WIND POWER SET TO BECOME WORLD'S LEADING ENERGY SOURCE http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/Update24.htm  LESTER R. BROWN, EARTH POLICY - In 1991, a national wind resource  inventory taken by the U.S. Department of Energy startled the world when  it reported that the three most wind-rich states--North Dakota, Kansas,  and Texas--had enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national  electricity needs. Now a new study by a team of engineers at Stanford  reports that the wind energy potential is actually substantially greater  than that estimated in 1991. Advances in wind turbine design since 1991  allow turbines to operate at lower wind speeds, to harness more of the  wind's energy, and to harvest it at greater heights. Add to this the  recent bullish assessments of offshore wind potential, and the enormity  of the wind resource becomes apparent. In a joint assessment of global  wind resources called Wind Force 12, the European Wind Energy  Association and Greenpeace concluded that the world's wind-generating  potential -- assuming that only 10 percent of the earth's land area  would be available for development -- is double the projected world  electricity demand in 2020.
