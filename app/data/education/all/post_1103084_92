sometimes i feel like --   my formative years in fundamentalism give me the ability to be:   grace and truth and redemption and celebration   out here on the left fringes of this evangelical institution.   other times, i feel like i'm waking up in the middle of a bad dream --  where i'm locked inside of a christian bookstore or trapped as a character in a _Left Behind_ novel...  and um...i really want out.
