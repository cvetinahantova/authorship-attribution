Why does everyone always feel the need to have a damn boyfriend/girlfriend? C'mon. We're in  high school . As if any [or most] high school relationships last more than a year or so. Just whatever. I have a huge headache right now.  Okay, anyway, I really want to go to Sadie's, and I know who too. But... AH. The person I want to go with isn't consider popular, hot, cool, or anything. Psh, I don't care. I bet you he'd look so hot dressed up. Mhm. He's not into dances, or anything. Which sucks, eh?  Oh god, why? Everything is so confusing, and it annoys the crap out of me. Plus, the tennis is freaking the crap out of me. I suck at sports, so how the hell am I going to make it?  Oh yeah, and at CBS today, Laura was pissing the hell out of me. She's so damn annoying. She only hangs out with us because of Nikki. I dislike her, because she's fake. Fake fake fake. Moreso than Barbie, mkay? She thinks she's so hot. Ahaha RIGHT.   I'm such a bitch. Hurray!
