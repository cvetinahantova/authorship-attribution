There is nothing worse in life than having a sick child.    It evokes all the feelings of  helplessness, inadaquacy, and just plain old fear.   Jamie is sick.  While on date night, the phone rings, and Renee tells me that I have a sick boy.  He is running a temp, and has thrown up.  We head home right away.    Renee sent Jamie to our house with TJ, since we would be home so soon.  Savannah can't be exposed to illness.  Any kind of virus will put her in the hospital.  I pray she doesn't get this.   When we get home, I love on Jamie, and get him settled in bed.  I lay beside him, listening to his breathing.  It was so heavy and so fast.  I could feel this heart beating thru the covers, his body heat was making me sweat.  This was after giving him Motrin to bring it down.  Every few seconds, low moans would escape, while the muscles in his legs were twitching from the heat.    He slept all evening, peacefully.    Then the chills hit.  His skin was burning to the touch, his face was blood red, his eyes were blood shot, and still sunk in his head.  We couldn't get him warm enough to stop the chills.  It is 1am, and his is getting worse.  His head is hurting so severely he can't move, talk, or really answer us.    By 2am, we are in the ER.  They finally are able to get the temp down, and once it goes down, Jamie slowly returned to his normal self.  He is cracking jokes with the doctor, sitting in bed making fun of his brother, talking about his favorite video game, and talking about the Atlanta Braves.  My baby is back.   We have slept most of the day, he is still very sick.  We are waiting on his blood culture to come back, sometime tomorrow, but he will be ok.  Fevers are scary, especially for parents.
