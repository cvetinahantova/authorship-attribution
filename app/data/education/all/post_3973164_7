C'est fini, terminado, finito, finished...Thank God! I can once again hold my head high and unashamed as an upstanding American citizen - no longer willfully and knowingly wasting precious taxpayer money every time I get a paycheck. I am no longer a bio-terrorist...I mean I no longer work in bio-terrorism. I shall begin my journey to a new life and new experiences tomorrow - after suficient partying tonight, that is.   I have very much enjoyed this summer. Living with Amber was surprisingly easy. You'll have to ask her if living with me was just as simple. Doubtful. But, she is a wonderful person, a treasured friend and an impressive drinker. I will miss her dearly, but since she has decided to stay in Beautiful Wisconsin I hope to see her relatively often.  I am extremely excited, surprisingly nervous and naively over-confident as I head to Missouri to take the education of these  urlLink boys  into my hands.  Step one: find a house. Step two: lesson plans. Step three: learn French.  No problem!
