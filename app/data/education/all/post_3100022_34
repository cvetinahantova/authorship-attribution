Travelling around Europe you tend to notice things that are similar as well as those which are different. In Barcelona I noticed that it rained, quite a bit actually. In Paris, I noticed that there too, it also rained. I could say the same for Rome, pizza and well the list goes on but I think that you get the general idea. Not exactly a ground shattering discovery as it rained in a lot of places that we went to, which was quite a fantastic thing; as I really got to appreciate the times when it didn't rain, at those times when the sun was smiling down upon the earth, one could be truly thank-full that one has dry feet.   So at this point I would like to make a suggestion to travellers going abroad to European countries during springtime; take some hard wearing waterproof shoes, and many pairs of socks.   Last night I stayed at a friends place in Fulham Broadway, which is quite weird as I was just there the night before visiting some friends from the Contiki tour, even weirder was that I stayed fairly close to the pub where I dined* the night before. Actually my trip here as just been one long series of coincidences (see yesterday) I really don't know why, but it has been very enjoyable.   *dined is a subjective word in this case. It is correct in the sense that I had quite a superb Guinness served extra cold, and that although Guinness is served in a drinking vessel, one tends to find that our beautiful thick black beverage is more a meal** than a refreshment. I wish as much could be said about the actual food.   ** An outdoorsy type person (perhaps a farmer) once told me their thoughts on Guinness, I think it went along the lines of: "Too thick to drink, too thin to plow".
