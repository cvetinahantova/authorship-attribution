Over the weekend, my husband had a bad cough and he said to me, "I think I have whooping cough.  Do people get whooping cough anymore?"  To which I replied (in the know-it-all way that I have) "No, there's a vaccine for that.  Hardly anyone gets  that  anymore."  The next day in the paper:   urlLink Whooping cough breaks out at Tacoma hospital  .  Shows what I know.
