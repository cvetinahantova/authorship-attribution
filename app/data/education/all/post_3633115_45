My landlord installed my new kitchen counters, sink, and faucet today.  I now have a double stainless steel deep sink with the sprayer nozzle thingy.  SO much better than any crummy porcelain sink that has been used for a really long time.   Probably the best part was when my landlord looked at our hideous carpet and offered to have the carpet cleaners, who were next door, stop by to clean the carpet.  YAY!   So, not only did I get a new kitchen (sorta), I also got nice clean carpets.  I'm a happy lady I can tell you.   I tried to upload a picture with the new blogger picture thingy, but it doesn't seem to like me much. I keep messing with it, so you can all see who the hell is talking about stuff that means absolutely nothing to you!
