just a note to say, grabbing dinner off the "expires today/half price" pasta shelf at shoprite is a worthwhile expenditure.  while eric was waiting his turn in line at the deli (took 20 minutes) this afternoon, i was looking around, and found a bunch of fancy pasta things marked down from $4 to $2 because they had fresh vegetable/seafood/whatever stuff on top of them and will go bad eventually... i picked up a mushroom one and a seafood one (fettuccini pescatore seafood special).  they looked decent at the time, and now that i'm having the latter one for dinner, it was an extremely quality investment (& yes, my brain  is  completely fried.)  back to work
