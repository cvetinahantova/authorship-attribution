i wish that things were different.  so many things.  too many things to list.           i hate that feeling i get when i try to hold back tears and my throat closes up...and all of the muscles in my jaw begin to hurt.            i'm torn between past memories and what i know is right for me to do. i try to make connections with old friends that hurt me knowing that i shouldn't...and then they get the best of me because they make it obvious that they don't care. they still have the power to make me cry. why is it so hard to let go? i'm not as strong as i make myself believe.     and why don't people care? why don't other people feel pain? how come i seem to feel pain so much deeper than anyone else? i want answers but i can't find them. but what would i do with them if i had them?   sometimes i feel so alone. yet, there are so many times when i truly believe that i want to be alone. i think if i didn't really want to be alone i would work harder at not being alone. i ruin friendships. i don't keep in touch with the friends i do have. i don't try to keep romantic relationships from falling apart...i just let go...and then have trouble actually letting go after they're gone. i'm not making any attempt at finding someone new to start a relationship with. truth is, i really don't know how now that i'm out of college. that and i'm not sure there's really a point to it all.  maybe i don't really wish that things were different.  not many things.  just few enough to list.
