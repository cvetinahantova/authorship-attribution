Mood:  Blank  Listening To:  Midnight Sonata-Beethoven  Wow, Im feeling sooooo blank tonight, however seeing as I havent updated for a good while, my apologies...mainly because of tests, I'll tell ya whats been happening. ICT was pretty long and tiring, alot of detail. The FOUR module tests for science I took wore me out, the 50 minute wait inbetween the 3rd and the 4th pretty much drained all enthusiam, alas, lets hope I did well.  RE today wasnt so bad, easy questions on the stuff I'd revisied, but harded questions on stuff I hadnt revised but sorta knew, alas, sorta the test you'd expect really. I REALLY want to get an A* in this, Im sorta expected too...and I could.  umm, Jo's really into Ben at the moment, sorta annoying as She's dumped me (see Dean and Nelson) before, looks like I'll have to find something else to do, meh.  mmm, Im sorta in a weird mood at the moment, I dont really care about going out with anyone, but yet, I sorta would like someone..:/  blaaaaaaaaaaaah, Im sorta frustrated, gah I need some entertainment, but the gcses are boring me SO MUCH!  Well, thats enough from me, expect something from me tomorrow...  Saying that, Im about as reliable as a Tom Emerton(TM) Joke..
