Things turned up from yesterday, today was a 2 hour delay! So I got to sleep in an extra hour then talked to Katherine and played Gunbound for a while... Went to A and B-Block, wasn't bad, I had energy to interact with all the others so I got stuff done. Carpenter didn't seem in the best mood so I didn't bug him today, yeah... Umm, then there was lunch... It was one of the more scaring than any others I've had. Not mentally but physically, me and Dane started to fight some more and he gave me indian burns as usual. But then I pulled him outside and I got whitewashed so I was cold all over. It wasn't the cold but the whole slapping my wrist as hard as possible that did it. At first it was just Dane so no scars 'cept for a little one on my left arm, but then Kenneth wanted to try(I was holding my arm out, I was letting them... I have issues). Anyways, I had him wait for my arm to get feeling again and he slapped as hard as he coud(he's really fucking strong, looks kinda like a dwarf). So after that my arm was all purple... I think he popped a few veins in my arm, but now I've got his brand on my wrist... He felt guilty after he looked at it, so yeah... FUN!! Then Zak decided I was masocistic, from what I was letting them do I might be... But I don't know, anyways... Went with Trevor and Adrian and ate some hotdogs and cookies at my house. Had fun with them, Adrain pretended to be a Pokemon and attacked Trevor... He kept evolving into different Adrians. FUN! ONCE AGAIN!! Then I went to Drama 2, had tons of fun in there. We played games and I made an ass of myself more than most but they all thought it was funny so yeah... That's all I've got for now ^^.  Congratulations to Katherine figureing out the message! It was unexpected... I love you Kat!
