I cancelled my cable at the wrong time   It looks like  urlLink Iron Chef is going American  (Via  urlLink Chicha ).  I think this is horrible.  The core of the show (competitive cooking) is not the heart of the show and the heart of the show ( urlLink a fantastically gay matador with an unlimited fortune and a penchant for zestily eating bell peppers  ) is quintessentially Japanese.  The idea of poor Chairman Kaga going so far out of his element as to host dinner for Paige Davis and Dennis Franz makes me sad.  According to the article, the plan is to find a new chairman.  But who could be more than a shadowy second to Kaga?  (Maybe,  urlLink this guy , but even he's a longshot.)  If I didn't have so much faith in Kaga to have duped some stupid American into a grossly unbalanced agreement for the rights to "Iron Chef," I would say this smacks of a fucked up post-modern imperialism.  ( Edit:   I've been shooting from the hip with my posts lately, so I'm going back to clean up the writing here and there).
