Yeargh   This it getting tiring. And the semester hasn't even started! Here's the recount:  - Sunday evening - Trip to Buffalo. No problems at the border (it was  too  good to be true... Read on for details. Arrived late in Buffalo. Went to sleep.   - Monday. Got up early, got passport picture, went to consulate. Bitch says I need bank statement. And medical examination. By the time it took to get it, consulate is closed. Sux0ring ensues. Slept the rest of the day (and night).   - Tuesday. Went to consulate (again). Bitch says "where is I-94". SUX0R! Customs officer never gave me one. Also, bitch could have told me that yesterday. Trip to border and back. Too late again. Got on internet, found on Canadian Immigration website that I  don't  need medical exam.   - Wednesday. Go to consulate. Give bitch paperwork. Tell her I don't need medical exam, for quote-and-quote reason. Bitch says Letter of Admission missing. I think "BITCH! I JUST GAVE IT TO YOU!". Turns out it was upside-down and she's an idiot. I ask to see her supervisor. An hour later, I get my Study Permit, no medical examination, no other problems. Bitch is very nice to me all of a sudden. Off to Canadia! Waterloo, to be specific. Several-hour-drive, eventless except for the fact that we find the car missing its gas tank cap. Waterloo: Turn in my study permit. Got to talk to housing. No on-campus housing available. Get big-ass list of off-campus housings. Will spend all night reading and selecting. Go see if advisor is in office. Not. Drive back to Kingston. 3/4 hours. To do: Get bank account. Get cellphone. Get apartment. Get dad to hospital for biannual checkup. Get sleep. Get Smart. Err... DEFINITIVELY get sleep. Get campus ID. Get insurance. Get enrolled in courses. Get bills. Pay bills. Get gas cap for car. Get a drink. Now. . .  Back. Talk to... Um, someone. Ain't telling who. Get Canadian drivers license. All that and more before Tuesday. Fucking great, eh? Also: FUCKING NETSCAPE! LET ME SEND MY FUCKING E-MAIL! FUCKTARDS! ALL OF THEM! *throws hands up in disgust and walks away*
