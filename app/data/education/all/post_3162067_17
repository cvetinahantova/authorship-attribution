Hmm. Blogger has been busy making some changes and I'm really confused. I don't know how it is at your end, dear reader, but I feel a little on the lost side. At the moment it's 1.20am on a Sunday night. What the hell am I doing up this late? I hear you ask. Well, I could ask myself the same question. It's a good question. All I want to do now is sleep. But at 3.45am Si and I are catching a bus to London to have a few agency interviews, and I just know that if I go to sleep now I am unlikely to wake up in time. So instead, I will sleep on the bus. Dear God, I hope I can sleep on the bus. We plan to arrive early so we can get a decent seat. I'm kinda banking on the fact that there won't be many lunatics like us who are contemplating travel this early in the morning. I had so many plans of things to do to keep me awake, but now they all seem to be dissolving. I think I'll have a bath. Well, a shower might be better, as there's less chance of me drowning in a shower. God, I'm getting old. In my pre-teacher days I would have thought nothing of staying awake 'til the wee hours. In fact, going to bed at 2am was the norm. Even quite recently (well, a year ago) I could happily stay awake 'til at least 1am, and not even feel tired. Now I'm just about ready to pass out. Think a cigarette and a caffeinated drink might be in order now.
