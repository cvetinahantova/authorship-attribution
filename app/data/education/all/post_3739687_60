hello,  well i'm just hanging out at my favorite internet cafe.  i have internet in  my room now, but i need to get a bunch of downloads and i don't feel like  waiting hours.  my connection is fast enough but downloading songs takes  forever.  anyway... i love my new computer.  i need to figure some things  out and get a digital camera so i can send ya'll pictures but other than  that it seems very userfriendly and reliable.  well knock on wood you never  know when these things are going to die on you.  well today is the queen's birthday and also mother's day.  thai's take the  royal family very seriously.  i've even heard it is improper for them to say  their names outloud.  i'm not sure if this is really true.  also, one of the  thai teachers looks a little like the queen so one of the farang's, ronald  from south africa, told her so and she thought it was the best compliment in  the world.  ronald is a very nice guy with a funny accent though.  he sounds  more european at times to me than south african.  anyway...  school is going o.k.  i'm looking forward to the weekend.  being able to  sleep in today spoiled me so i hope i''m not dragging tomorrow.  one good  thing is that tameron, the girl from south africa who is splitting classes  with me now, is going to take a couple of classes tomorrow.  i think she  needs to get a feel for what it is like to teach thirty girls in case she  ever has to run the class by herself.  i'm sure she'll be able to handle it  she seems like a bright creative girl.  gotta run. jane  _________________________________________________________________ Check out Election 2004 for up-to-date election news, plus voter tools and  more! http://special.msn.com/msn/election2004.armx
