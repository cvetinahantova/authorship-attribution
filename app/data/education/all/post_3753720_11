Peace on Earth Music  was founded in 2004 by my Dad, Craig Pearson and his friend Brad Moses to create and promote music celebrating the cosmic reality within each person. They wish to celebrate the expansion of happiness, higher states of consciousness, and the vision of peace for our world family.   Listen to the Songs     urlLink
