I just remembered why I hated Yahoo so much. Normally I have it sitting on whenever I'm online, in case a friend comes on and we can have a quick chat.  But,  when absolute strangers keep asking you for ur asl, then take like 5 minutes to reply, and say nothing intelligent at all too... grrr! Either talk to one person at a time, or don't bug me, baby! I can just imagine these poor twits with a screen full of PM windows, and none of them have ppl they know, and they're trying to talk to them all! Oh well... at least u can block the idjuts!
