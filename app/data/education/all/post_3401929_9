Well, today turned out to be quite interesting.  During first period (English) I was once again my hyper self...though normally I save that for Monday.  Chelsea repeatedly told me to shut up, though I did not (of course).  Algebra was funny.  We had a substitute who didn't allow any talking at all, and so of course they guys were talking or punching the wall and acting like they didn't do it (mainly Curtis...we're eighth graders, not first).  I didn't know we had gym today, so I had to borrow Brooke's sneakers...I wore flip flops.  In FCS we made banana bread.  That was fun.  Curtis was being hyper again.  Constantly hyper people annoy me.  I had a meeting for the high school concert choir during homeroom...I will be a Soprano 2 next year.  We did worksheets during Social Studies.  Mr. Sundin, our substitute, threatened to "knock both your skulls together" to Anthony and Joey, because they were acting all macho and stupid.  We watched a boring IMAX movie in Science that I've seen a hundred times before, and then in Communications we read more of  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer .  Well, I read Chapters 18-20.  I didn't know Becky and Tom acted so childish!  They never do in Wishbone.  I love that show...too bad they took it off the air.  Anyway, I straightened out this whole thing with this one guy I like, so now life is just peachy keen.
