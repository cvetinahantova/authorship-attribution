A few of you have informed me that posting a comment in Blogger is more difficult than getting a refund from a heroine dealer. (I didn't think twice about that analogy the first time someone told me, after the 4th time, I'm beginning to wonder about my target audience.)  So, I've gone and made the commenting process as quick and painless as possible.  So... Make me feel special and leave me a message.    Just don't go asking me if I could lend you $20 for an "emergency appointment" with your "doctor".
