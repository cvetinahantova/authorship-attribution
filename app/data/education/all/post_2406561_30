Okay, I'm going to try to explain last night/today in bits and parts. It started off with Efrain and I talking as usual, just joking around, and stuff. Efrain got this idea that he wanted to mess around with Jolanda's head, and he told her that I was cheating on him. (NOTE: Efrain and I are like, "married". What the hell, I do not know, ask our pyshco friends.)
