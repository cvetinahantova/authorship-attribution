Relate phoned again this morning. I spoke with the manager and explained my position, she was very understanding and said I could pay as much as I could afford now and discuss the rest with the counselor. I opted for 15 UKP, which she said was fine. Sandra had said she didn't want to come, but the lady said if she could come to the first one to be assessed that would be better, even if she didn't want to come to any more.   She is due to call back to arrange the appointment.
