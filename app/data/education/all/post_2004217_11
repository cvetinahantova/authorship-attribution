Gah. Here's me, quite happily going about my daily business without fuss, no friend troubles, no family troubles and most of all no MEN troubles. Until! 1. Debbs isn't speaking to Laura because (from what I can gather) Laura doesn't like Debbie's boyf Matt and gave him a "dirty look" at Becky's party. Good Grief. How petty. It is nobody's fault that Laura and Matt don't get on, Laura seems to be just fine about Debbs not liking  her  boyf, so just get the fuck over it!! 2. Saw Loz at the bus stop today who was making disgusting comments about me and Draper. Apparently they've been winding him up about me and him and making up texts "from" me asking if he'd got a boner. I repeat, just get the  fuck  over it! I don't fancy him, he doesn't fancy me, end of story. Am now dreading Wednesday due to his (Draper's) presence. Woo.  Ceff x   Calm before the storm, set it off...
