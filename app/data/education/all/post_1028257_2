Welcome to the Official GRAND re-opening of my Blog!         What's a Blog? A Blog is short for web log, or a website where I can post writing, quotes, links to other sites, pictures, or all three together...in short. Um...         So anyway... Now that I have a better setup at work on my cool computer (It's still no Mac), I hope to publish daily. I usually show up a few minutes early to check all my e-mails, and websites. Really, where is the effort in writing a short paragraph each day... and adding a picture or two or even links to a few weird news items or whatever?  I thought so. (punk)   Oh, and the really fun part? You can post comments to what I've said, or what other people have said about what I've said! We're a forum, people!   Also, I plan on sending out a very small e-mail with a link to let you know when I have updated with a post. This way, to be my friend, all you have to do is click on the link and see what I said for the day. I'm trying to make this easier than replying to an annoying mass e-mail. Plus I will have content!
