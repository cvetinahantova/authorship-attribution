Useful Distraction   I've been trying, in these last weeks of my MFA, to get a lot of writing done.  Call it a mad dash to the finish line, an intense despair over the void that is my future, or maybe a clingy and preemptive nostalgia for the days of deadlines and optimism.  I won't bore you with a detailed discussion of what I am writing, though I am happy to say that I have been unusually productive.    Rather, I'll bore you with a different topic, namely:  what effect do peripheral activities have on one's writing? Particularly, I'm thinking of music and Red Sox games.  But it would be misleading if I didn't mention the internet, blogging, and Impeccable Jones in particularly.  I'll deal with each of these in posts over the next week.  But first, music.  I've noticed that I tend to listen to the same music when I'm writing productively:                    Sly and The Family Stone, " urlLink There's a Riot Going On  "                   Graham Parker, " urlLink Squeezing Out Sparks "                   X, " urlLink Los Angeles "                   Solomon Burke, " urlLink The Very Best of ,"                     Guns N' Roses, " urlLink Appetite For Destruction "                   Me First & The Gimme Gimmes,  " urlLink Have a Ball "                   AC/DC, " urlLink Highway to Hell "  This is a pretty diverse list, I think, but it finds unity in the familiarity I have with the music itself.  These are not the albums I've had in my collection the longest, but ones that I've had for several years and generally don't listen to in other contexts anymore.  I think the first track on an album is also hugely important for me, because that's the one that gets me going.  In this regard, nothing is better than "Luv n' Haight," on "There's A Riot Goin' On," because it manages to be energizing, ominous and soulful all at once.  But "Welcome to the Jungle," is pretty good too, though, mostly because it kicks so much ass.  I have to wonder how the mood of this music affects my writing.  Certainly, I think it does somehow, though I admit the possibility that I am acting like a pitcher who refuses to wash his favorite socks.  Rather than wonder about the specifics of that, I'd like to propose an experiment, open to any of you readers.  I know that a number of you are classmates of mine in the workshop, and that in addition to these people, a number of you are writers in other contexts.  This would be particularly telling with writers who usually don't listen to music when they write.  You can probably guess where I'm going with this: try it out, pay attention, and let me know how it goes.  Or, if you do listen to music when you work, try listening to something you would never listen to, try it out, and report back.
