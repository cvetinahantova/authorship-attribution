Enschede Nite on July     pssst.. be quiet.. hear the whisper of the wind callin out my name    "wake up and get up, dear for the nite sky is so clear  breath the air and don't cry for it's just another meteor passing by  feel the glimpse and don't defy for the path would not gone by  so say goodnite,  not goodbye.."   [for all my dearest enschede friends, my meteors...]
