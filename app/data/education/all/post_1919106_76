1337ifying the system   Well, I finished the first complete version of the dsh script. The most difficult part was to manage all the different optional arguments, but I did the smart thing and looked at CPAN for a module that would do it for me, and lo and behold, there it was. I feel a bit sorry for the lackeys though - I let them try to work it out the hard way. Wait a minute, what am I saying? I don't fell sorry for them. It's not like they have anything else to do... Let them work their brains out.  Now, that script is only the first stage of the 1337ifying program. Now I want to take all the other scripts we're using and upgrade them. And soon I'll be the only one who knows how the whole thing works, muahahahaha! Job security it is.
