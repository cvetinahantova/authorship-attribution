He did it!  Jacob pulled it off and graduated with his class.  After the struggle he had for 2 years I am proud to say that he made it.  He even graduated with honors.  If he hadn't gone through that tough time he may have even had more honors.  My parents were able to come up for the ceremony.  It was nice having them here.  I wish they could have stayed longer.  We've had tornado and thunderstorm watches the last few days.  It's kind of exciting, but we never get the good stuff.  It seems to pass either above of below us.  I know it doesn't seem right to wish for bad weather when so many people are suffering from it.  I have this overwhelming urge for a serious storm to blow through.  I don't know why, I think it has something to do with why I always seem to have trauma in my life.  I like to work through tough things.  It's what makes life so interesting.    Tomorrow I am going down to Alabama for a few days.  My dad flew into Portland early this morning and is driving my sister, Elizabeth, back.  She's going to start a new life and go back to school.  Things have been pretty rough for her in Oregon.  We are hoping their weather is ok for the trip.  My mom and I are driving to Atlanta to pick up my d√°d's car from the airport.  I've never been to Atlanta, so I'm looking forward to it.  I found out something really strange yesterday.  The pastor of our church here in Danville was on the same Luther Tour to Germany that I was on 21 years ago!  I don't remember him and he doesn't remember me, but that was a very weird coincidence!  I'm going to show him my pictures some time.
