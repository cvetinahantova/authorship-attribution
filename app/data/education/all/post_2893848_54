Are you asking or quizzing?  If it's the latter, then I've cheated.  I googled the phrase and found that it comes from Sir Thomas Browne's   urlLink Hydriotaphia  , or  Urn Burial ,or,  a Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns Lately Found in Norfolk .  It looks like good stuff.  As for this Uriel, a google search turned up  urlLink this Eurasian mountain mammal  that looks to be something between a deer and a ram.   urlLink Here is an encyclopedia article on the horned bastards .  That said, the passage does seem to indicate Urial is a single person, as far as that goes, all I could find was  urlLink a klezmer musician  and  a lethally injected  urlLink murderer  in TX, both post-dating Elliot by many many years.    Anyone else have any ideas?  This is fun.
