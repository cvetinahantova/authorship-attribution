I am so excited and cannot believe that in a little over three weeks (3 weeks and 1 day) I will be in Italy. I still have so much to do before I leave. But the excitement motivates me and stirs a fire under my feet.     Garage Sale this Saturday...Whooo Hoooo!           I have been studying for my grammar test I have to take in Sept, but have a chat session this Sunday to quiz another teacher...it should be entertaining seeing that we both are procrastinating with our assignments. I have to come up with a syllabus and three lesson plans...okay, mom and dad.... LESSON PLANS ARE FUN!!!!  At least they are for me teaching English to Italian children. And on a side note....THANK YOU Mrs. Quesenbury for teaching French class so well...I am structuring my syllabus and games and such after her class. Hey, why re-invent the wheel?  Okay, that last sentence was no actually grammatically correct. But at least I know that right, no?  I think I am getting sick. That is just great. I study...my nose runs. I move around and try to pack stuff...my nose runs. I sit at the computer typing on my blog...my nose runs. IT NEVER STOPS. Where is it all coming from? Grossed out?  Reminder!!!: Gotta get a special birthday present before Sunday! Happy Birthday in advance if you read this!!!!!
