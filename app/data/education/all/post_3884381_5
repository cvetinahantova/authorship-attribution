Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge recently warned our country about possible large scale terror attacks on or before the November election date.  There is much speculation that al Qaeda and other terror groups would like to impact the election. Many believe that the attacks in Spain did just that.   So I ask, in the wake of all of the discussions and announcements following that warning, has anyone thought that al Qaeda just may want Bush in power?  Could it be that these attacks are planned to unify the voters to re-elect W.?  Isn't he is the "figure head of evil" in Jihad?  Sure Bush would continue the fight, and Kerry might as well, but Islamic Militants all over the world have (in different words of course) called Bush their anti-Christ.  Doesn't that weaken their jihad stance to have him out of power?  Just a little light-hearted food for thought on a Tuesday.
