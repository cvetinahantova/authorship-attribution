mundane crisis - upcoming visitors - political compass - theological speculation  just before I left the office at noon yesterday -- Jerry Fliger (from BGSU days) called to say that he and Deb were in Akron and may drop in after lunch.  We do love drop-inners, but all the same i sped home to redd up a bit (note the VERY eastern-Ohio-vernacular use of "redd up"? a bit of impressive code switching, eh?).    As I walked in the doors, I found Lynn on her hands and knees.  Mark and Toby began our bathroom remodelling yesterday and just to get things started on an adventurous foot -- accidentally flooded the kitchen (through the ceiling) by knocking open a pipe.   It was a rains-it-pours moment.   we're looking forward to lots more friends this week.  Teddy for dinner tonight (Cedarville Ted), the Schandersons (of Shy Quiet People) for lunch tomorrow & Bei (from BGSU) for dinner on Thursday.  Lynn may off to BG on Friday to watch Scott (old student) play in the all state football game...  Took the  urlLink Political Compass  Test today.  Great stuff, if you're interested to know how you rank.  I've been speculating that I've been getting lefter and lefter, but who knew!  I outlefted Ghandi and Nelson Mandella -- and I even said that I believed in spanking! (not often and never in anger - in case we haven't conversed about this...)  Harry said some great things on Sunday-- he spoke of the difficulty of giving *and* receiving. A very nice interpretation of matthew 18.  I'll see if I can get a copy up and link to it later.  the idea is that abject dependency is the only way to receive the Kingdom of God.  So I was thinking -- how is it possible to enter that space of abject dependency given the careful wealthy way I live.  I have some answers brewing, but I don't like to think about 'em.  peace~
