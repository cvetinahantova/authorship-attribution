This morning, a forlorn graduate student at Brown posted to the grad students listserv that her cat was stuck in a stree and had been there for about five days. Apparently, the fire and police departments claimed they didn't have the right equipment or couldn't perform such a rescue. So, grad students to the rescue, folks posted with numerous suggestions of other people and places to call. One student even volunteered to climb the tree himself. I'll update as soon as I know more ... but I imagine this cat will be out of the tree by dinnertime.    Update : Cat has been rescued; no ropes, daredevil students or trampolines (all suggested solutions) were needed. A local tree service volunteered to help out.
