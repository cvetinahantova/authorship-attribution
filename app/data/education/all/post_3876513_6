urlLink    C'est moi!  urlLink        I'm so excited!  I figured out how to do it!!  I'm still not really sure on all of it, but at least this is here, right?  :o)  Plus, I got to have some fun with Photo Shop.  Tee, hee!!   I'm so glad that it's Friday.  I'm going to go home and clean my house!!  It's gotten so messy in the last couple of days.  And then I'm going to watch Pippi Longstocking because I haven't watched it in years and it turned out that someone I know has it on DVD.  Coolness!   I went to a TownCraft cookware party yesterday.  I'd never been to anything like that and it was very interesting.  The salesman, Larry, did an excelent job.  I really would like one of those electric griddles.  They don't require any oil put into them--there's actually oil put into a basin inside the griddle during production.  When it warms up, the oil comes up through the metal and keeps the stuff from sticking.  It's the coolest thing!  Except it's over $500.  So, I could do a payment plan and it's got a lifetime warantee, but still.  That's a whole lot of money.  The food he made was really excelent.  I keep thinking of this fried chicken and really incredibly tender steak that he made.  Mmmmmmm.   After the party was over, I got to sit and talk with some poeople that were also friends of the hostess.  We ended up sitting there until 10:30 without realizing that it was so late!  It was so great.  I like having the opportunity to interact with people sometimes.  :o)   Anyway, I'm going to go home and try to make some yummy food and clean my house.  I hope you all have a great weekend and have an awesome time at church!   Love and blessings!
