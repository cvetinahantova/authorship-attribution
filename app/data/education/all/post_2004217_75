I feel better today, stronger. I cheered up a lot after Blogging yesterday, partially due to talking to Sam and knowing that he was there for me, and partially due to listening, strangely, to a lot of hip hop. New additions to my mp3 collection include NERD and 50 Cent, who make me want to dance everything away. Sam was wonderful; I don't remember what he said, but he seemed to make me feel safe. Oh I remember now- we were talking about our afternoon in town on Saturday, and he said "you guys are my happy pills" :o)... He let me know that he was there for me if I needed him, which sometimes is better than trying to give advice, I think.  Went to the dentist's today, and came away with a shiny new filling! Goody. How I love free healthcare- not only do they repair your teeth for you, dentists like to numb half of your face for nearly 5 hours instead of payment! I spent lunchtime acting like a stroke victim: all numb on one side and having to eat everything in tiny little pieces. Now the numbness has worn off (thank god: I didn't mind that so much, but the inability to speak properly was beginning to piss me off) and I am left with a dull ache in the back of my mouth where the needle went in. Ouch.  Currently listening to the new Hundred Reasons album: it's not as good as their debut, but come on, it's not like anyone expected them to produce another classic like that without a little practice. It's not bad though- it's got oomph and emotion and it'll probably transfer really well into a live setting. Yay!
