omg i stayed up until 4.45am last night/this morning! I could not go to sleep. I swear I have some disorder or something...i already know i have depression, seperation anxiety and an eating disorder(no im not aneroxic or bulimic). what is it called when you can't sleep or focus on anything?(sleep deprived?) and no i don't think i have a.d.d. hmm well i had to go to school today...after a 4 hours night of sleep. I still haven't finished my U.S. history 2 but its just because i have one thing left to do-an interview on the vietnam war.i sarted american lit 2 today, well i got my books but i probably wont do my work until monday. after school i came home, went online for a little while and hung out with my brother and matthew(michael was still at work). then i went out to dinner with my dad, tyler and haylea. we went to olive garden then to walmart afterwards because haylea wanted a toy ad i got a cd-norah jones. i really wanted to find the all american rejects but i couldn't so i got norah instead..plus my mom likes her too so we can share it.uh we got home at 9.30 and i've been onhe comp for about an hour. not really exciting but oh well. tomorrow i'm going to alyssa's to spend the night with rina too, then this weekend i might hang out with some old ballet pals. oh my gosh my uncle just got a pool put in at his house and tomorrow is the first day we can swim in i think. i haven't see it yet but apparently it has a waterfall, rockslide and something else but i forgot...anyways-it cost him about $120,000. crap thats a lot of money.
