HEY HEY READ ALL ABOUT IT!!!       Well I have great news I am officially a teacher now. Yesterday was my final interview with the district I had applied for. It is Los Nietos School District in Whittier, (only 15 minutes away from home...yey=) ). Later on that night the principal called and offered me the job. I will be teaching a fourth grade immersion class. Praise God for an answered prayer. Thanks for those of you that were praying for me specifically for this.    Prayer request:   Please pray for Sam which is the son of the directors of the Harambee in Pasadena. The doctors diagnosed him with cancer. I can limitly understand how it is because one of my aunts went through that.    Tomorrow   it is going to be chaotic here at my house. My aunt is baptizing my baby cousin and they are going to have a big party with tamborazo (mexican form of music). Luckily there is an event  going on at church that I will be going to at night for a while. ( I am trying to avoid being here). The girls from the church are getting together with the pastor's wife and she will be speaking to us.  Last event went really well and I am looking foward to it!! I pray everyone is doing well. I thank God for all those special people I am able to build a relationship with.
