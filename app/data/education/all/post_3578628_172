I love posting these so let's all post dumbass quotes.  I'll put two up there for pure entertainment.  They are old but that doesn't matter.  Larry King: "What do people misunderstand about you most"   George Walker Bush: "That I'm running on my dad's name... (!?!)  I'm proud of my dad... I reconciled my love for my dad a long time ago"   -- What the heck is he talking about? (2000)  Bush: "First of all, Cinco de Mayo is not the independence day. That's dieciséis de Septiembre, and ..."  Matthews: "What's that in English?"   Bush: "Fifteenth of September."  (Dieciséis de Septiembre = Sept. 16)   — Hardball, MSNBC, May 31, 2000
