Another night of no sleep, I spent the whole night worrying. I really think I've done the wrong thing with the car, despite Sandra's blessing. I am going to ring up today and try to get it cancelled. I've even phoned the man up with the old Clio for sale (the one I saw on Friday that was tidy but was too basic), it's still available. I just hope I can cancel OK, the terms and conditions don't read well, but when does small print ever make sense? I've worked myself into a panic and now I am scared.
