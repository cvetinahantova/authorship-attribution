The clock will keep ticking   No matter how you want it to stop even for a brief moment   It will continue it hours, it minutes, it seconds…   Eventhough you want it to hold on a minute     the clock is the metaphor of our life   when the good times happen to us, we want it to stop   gives us chance to enjoy our good times…   but…   when things don’t go as we wish them to be…   we’re hoping so much that time will pass by quickly   for us to forget the sorrow     like the clock, we can set our life   if we want the life to be joyful….   We have to cherish every moment of it….   Every seconds count   Grab it, don’t wait ….   To say something nice to our loved ones   To do what we have to do….     Because….   Like the the clock,our life will continue….
