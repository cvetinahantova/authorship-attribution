urlLink Performance-Driven Budgeting: The Example of New York City's Schools. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Dorothy Siegel.  It takes a look at how New Yory City is performance-based budgeting in it's schools.  From the ERIC Digest:  In mid-1996, a planning team of key central-office administrators, district representatives, education researchers, school reformers, and teachers' union officials traveled to Edmonton, Alberta, to attend a conference on school-based budgeting, where they learned about Edmonton's decentralized school system. A few months later, Chancellor Crew articulated a vision of a performance-driven school system that "focuses its energies on the sole goal of improving performance in teaching and learning" by:   * Defining clear standards for student learning   * Identifying educational strategies for all students to meet these standards   * Aligning all resources, policies, and practices to carry out these strategies   * Tracking results   * Using the data to drive continuous improvement and holding the entire system accountable for student performance (Siegel and Fruchter)   The chancellor invited New York City's thirty-two semi-autonomous districts and schools to pilot PDB, a key component of a performance-driven system. Their task, Chancellor Crew explained, was to design and develop innovative strategies for eventual systemwide implementation, and to identify "legal, contractual, accepted practice, or other constraints which limit local flexibility and discretion over the use of resources."
