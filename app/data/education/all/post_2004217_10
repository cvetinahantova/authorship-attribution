Hummmm. I should be doing homework. English homework. I should be doing it with great enthusiasm, because I like analysis questions. But I find myself here on this blog, in the middle of a conversation with Luke on MSN. He's babbling on about something; I haven't replied in about 15 minutes but he keeps sending me messages. Ahh, he's signed out- "gtg c ya l8r.x" (that's right, not only is he TEXT LANGUAGE OVERLOAD MAN but he also has a chronic disability to use the space bar after a full stop). I feel almost dirty for going out with him- why did I have to choose someone who is so blatantly, BLATANTLY wrong for me? I doubt this is hindsight speaking though, I think subconsciously I wanted someone so much that when he messaged me and told me how wonderful I was, I just fell for it. Stupid girl.  Ceff x   You called me on the phone, but you don't even wanna talk!
