What is so cool about technology is that there is NEVER a shortage of things to learn.  Some folks are addicted to many things, I am addicted to technology.  I call this mind candy.   Input, give me more input.   What I am writing here is probably senseless drivel but that is ok since I am changing the settings and learning how to customize the Blogger interface.   I am learning how to add Favorite Links and such as that.   Please bear with me as I stumble around in here.  You will also be happy to know that you will be able to see my wife Katy posting here as well.  I set her up as my team member and she will be able to post here as often as her heart desires.  That will give this blog some variety.   Cool stuff aye?
