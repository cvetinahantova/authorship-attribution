Nobody ever really knows you. People see what they see through the eyes of their experience, and your final image is a kaleidoscope of traits. Sifting through the shades of perception is a hard job, but it seemed to be my calling during my early twenties, the parentheses of my life I call the ‘what-were-you -thinking’ years.     Basically, I was a nut, unstable. Well, in a poetic sort of way. Like Virginia Woolf, Zelda Fitzgerald or Anais Nin who wrote a journal entry that could have been my own –      There were always in me, two women at least, one woman desperate and bewildered, who felt she was drowning and another who would leap into a scene, as upon a stage, conceal her true emotions because they were weaknesses, helplessness, despair, and present to the world only a smile, an eagerness, curiosity, enthusiasm, interest.      I envisioned myself a tortured, misunderstood, lonely beauty with wells of meaningful, important philosophies. But, what others saw was quite different.   ***********************************************     “Hey, lush,” Seth said as my feet dangled and ribcage popped in his strong embrace. My giant of a little brother still kids me about the period I used to carry a half empty bottle of Captain Morgan’s Spiced Rum in my green and purple striped Guatemalan knapsack. You know, ‘just in case.’ And it didn’t take much for it to be the perfect occasion to pick up a jumbo fountain diet coke from the Circle K to mix a bit of festivity. I haven’t had a spiced rum and coke in years, but every time I just pass by a convenience store, I have a strange longing for the buttery-not-too-sweet flavor of the Captain!     Some of my ‘what were you thinking’ experiences made a more permanent impact. I still bear the mark of those years in the stately shape of a sunflower tattoo on my left inner thigh.   *********************************************   It was a perfect East Texas day, after the heavy spring rains and right before the condensation days of summer. Hex, my hip, whimsical jeweler boyfriend was in Dallas waiting for an adventure – so I enlisted the help of my wild and free, beautiful friend who longed to be a man, but was born a woman. She picked me up in her rough-and-tumble rusted Ranger pick-up and we began our escapade.     Back road driving is a tradition, a rite of passage for kids in Texas country, and Allie knew these roads like Arkansas kissing cousins. I sat back to enjoy the ride and take in the view – Oh, the beauty of springtime in Texas. Hills of pink cotton primroses, red velvet thistle, more-indigo-than-blue bonnets, delicate paintbrushes dipped in fiery orange and fields of wide-eyed, worshipping sunflowers.     The narrow black top road traced the border of farm fences through these fields just a catcall away from the swaying platter-sized heads heavy with seeds. It was there that I decided what I’d seal as my signature – a brazen, strong, prolific, vibrant sunflower. A picture of what I longed to be.     I proudly announced my decision, and Allie wrinkled her nose. “Get something cool like a snake or a ring of thorns,” she said. She couldn’t hold her stance for long and started laughing. “You are sunshine,” she said. “A sunflower is just what you need!”   ********************************************    “My Tinkerbell,” he said before brushing a kiss on my forehead. Hex dubbed me a little flying fairy early in our relationship and always referred to me as Peter Pan’s mischievous friend. It was either a reference to my slight build, fair skin and hip-length blond hair, or some weird elfin fantasy.     Already adorned with tattoos, Hex was thrilled at the idea of me getting one. Apparently his extensive knowledge of the art of tattooing kicked in because he immediately announced we were first going to Casa Bonita for tequila shots. We toasted to tattoos, we toasted to friends, we toasted to tequila, we toasted to getting toasted. At a buck-o-five, four shots had me melting to the floor.     Allie and Hex took action. “Let’s get her to Tigger’s before she changes her mind,” Allie said. And so they did.     Tigger’s Tattoos in the heart of Deep Ellum, a trendy renovated warehouse district in downtown Dallas, featured a movie screen glass window for spectators to live vicariously through the wantonly tattooed and pierced. With my courage nearly as high as my blood alcohol level, I introduced our trio. “We’re here to get a tattoo,” I said with a crooked, drunken grin.     A flamboyantly ink-covered young man gestured to the benches lining the wall. “Have a seat,” he said. “Electricity is out. It’ll be another hour or so before we’re up and running.     Had they overloaded the circuits with too many darting needles? My courage took a turn. “Oh, too bad,” I said. My high school theater classes came in handy as I lifted my hands in ‘exasperation.’ “We simply don’t have the time,” I added hopefully.     Allie and Hex were way ahead of me – ‘we’ve got plenty of time’, they sang in sickeningly perfect unison.     We spent the next hour designing the ideal sunflower and selecting the perfect spot to plant it. I decided on my inner thigh – hoping the meatiest part of my body would buffer the sharp vibrations of the needles. (Not nearly as erotic as you were thinking, right?)     After another twenty minutes listening to tattoo parlor banter -  ‘Hey, Toby, there’s another nipple piercing.” “I’m sorry sir, but we don’t have a regulation safety pin large enough to fit that.” “Lady, before we can tattoo you, we have to see the skin.” – Toby the tattoo artist called my name and led me to a dark gray leather and steel dentist’s chair directly facing the wall of windows.     “I guess you’ll just have to straddle the arms of the chair,” Toby said with a satisfied smile. He was still smiling half an hour later as he put the finishing touches on my immortal flower.
