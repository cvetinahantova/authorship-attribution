CASTAWAY TIMES TWO i am a tomato.  i got the crap sunburnt out of me yesterday.  i'm still in san pedro, day three.  i could stay here indefinitly.  its one of those places that attatches a sensor to your brain and blocks everything but what's around you. we took kayaks out yesterday.  Karen and Gabe (seattle/nyc) were in one and jessica (maryland) and i in the other.  the lake was windy as hell and it wasn�t long before we started taking on water.  but we kept right on paddling out in the middle of the lake.  we were similar to those cartoons where the character keeps paddling until he's underwater.  yeah, in the middle of lago atitlan, jessica and i were forced to jump ship.  hollywood makes the concept of being shipwrecked a novel, even romantic occurance.  i.e. titanic, swiss family robinson, gillian's island, that frickin tom hanks one, yadda yadda yadda (feel free to suggest your favorite shipwreck movie int he comments).  but i�ll tell you what my friends, being shipwrecked ain't no box of twinkies.  two words: life and death.  we hung in the balance, staring down the bloody point of the grim reaper's sickle.  well, not really, but it kind of sucked a little.  the kayak flipped over and we clung to the upturned bottom. waves bombarded us and all the while i successfully held both our cameras above water.  it took about 45 minutes for the wave to drift us into shore.  overall it was a good conversation starter.  as jessica and i faced immenent death head on we shared with each other what our favorite books, cds, and movies were.  a nice little icebreaker all in all. meanwhile gabe and karen were on shore watching the whole debacle.  we got to shore safe and in one piece which i was pretty happy about. we switched kayak partners on the way back, gabe and jessica had the kayak i was in earlier and low and behold the water taking on happen to them again.  karen and i didn't know though because we had jetted off across the lake.  a half an hour later we were like "Now where did they go?" i got back and went to a pub to watch the end of the holland/sweden euro cup match.  near the end of the game jessica storms in.  "do you have the key?� i lost my $%&@# sunglasses! it's fine with me it i never see a $%&@# kayak the rest of my life!"  i was sincerly empathetic with her plight, but the look on her face and overall demenor at that moment was empathatically hilarious. it's been really great hanging out with karen, gabe, and jessica.  cool, chill people.  as opposed to the potentially annoyed german gal in antigua, these three are true traveling buddies.  like rockstar chris from the bronx, who billy and i met in italy.  it a bit like a camp atmosphere at times because odds are you�ll never see these people again but the connection everyone has though the love of traveling is huge.  world budget travellers have a lot in common, similar personalities too.  it's pretyy cool the people you meet halfway around the world.  i go to guatemala and meet frenchies, israelis, dutch...etc.  cheers.
