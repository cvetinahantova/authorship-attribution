I'm totally zonked on Day-Quil, and life feels so weird right now.  * For those interested, my presentation on Joan Littlewood went really well.  * I overslept and missed rehearsal this morning, which nobody has let me forget yet. * I really like the biscuits at Popeye's chicken. * I have way too much to do this evening. * There is a production on campus that I'm involved in every weekend for the next four weeks, followed by dead week, then finals. Then summer school starts. * I need a drink.  Thank you. That is all.
