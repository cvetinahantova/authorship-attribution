hello,  well i was wrong about when monsoon season starts in thailand.  it's not the  middle of monsoon season it is the start of it now.  well as you can imagine  it is pouring down rain.  apparently it lasts till september and sometimes  into november so lots of rain is coming my way.  i don't really mind, but  sometimes when i absolutely have to leave my house it is a bitch.  also, i  lost my umbrella for a day so it caused me to be a hermit.  i just couldn't  deal with getting wet anymore.  anyway... tameron, the girl from south africa who is splitting my classes  with me, is working out very well so far.  she has tons of good advice and  is very active in helping me plan the classes.  i think she will actually  turn out to be a great teacher if she doesn't lose her drive.  sometimes st.  joe can take the drive out of you without you noticing.  there is just so  much paper work and lots of needless bitching it can take a toll if you let  it.  i try to stay positive, but at times i find myself complaining over the  smallest things.  anyway... the queen's b-day is tomorrow so no work.  yeah!  i'm glad because  i need a day off.  i'm still adjusting to this wake up at 7:40 business.   ugh!  just when i think i have the schedule down pat something happens to  mess with it.  i just have to roll with the punches.  fortunately, having  three older brothers has made me accustomed to this.  jk.  ya'll be good and i hope you are having a good summer.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ On the road to retirement?
