I’m experiencing a kind of peculiar laid-backness. I don’t know what it is, but there’s this odd kind of faith, suddenly, that everything will be okay, and everything will get done, somehow, if I just don’t think about it too hard. I haven’t really considered the approaching horrors of this essay-tastic weekend very seriously for a couple of days now. Maybe they call this denial, or maybe the auto-pilot has finally kicked in. Maybe I’ve reached some higher plane of teaching insight. Or maybe I’ve just got to the point where I couldn’t give a shit.  Whatever the reason, it’s quite nice. I’m working with it while it lasts.
