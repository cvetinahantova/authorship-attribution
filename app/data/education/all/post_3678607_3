I read today that the some bloggers are invited to the Democratic Convention, I wish I could go, but its a) on the other side of the country and b) I am not eligible to vote because, well, I'm not yet 18. I wish I was, I really want to vote. Anyway, I think that it's pretty neat that these bloggers get to go, they are a form of journalism, people read thier stuff, it makes sense.  Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner! That is what i'd truly like to be! For if I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner, Everyone would be in love with me!!  I don't even like hot dogs, or B-O-L-O-G-N-A, all those commercials did for me is teach me to spell bologna. Oy!  read  urlLink THIS !!
