testing today !   SAT 9   It is beyond me how the state can mandate testing for this population. They tend to have difficulty in stressful situations. Three hours of testing each day for six to seven days would cause "normal" folks lots of stress. Heck, most of the students at our school don't even have a chance to graduate. The only way the students can get out of it is to have their parents sign a waiver. The catch is, the districts are encouraged to not present exemption as an option. So, most schools say nothing about that possibility, and the parents have no idea.   The irony at my school is that one of the smartest students at our school, which is above normal I.Q in all academic areas, is exempt from the test. His mom has connections. Some of the most fragile, low self-esteemed children are having to take it, even though we know they will fail either by quiting, or taking it. Tlak about screwed up.   Second session of testing is starting...gotta go  Peace, Dave
