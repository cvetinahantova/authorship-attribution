Hello! Well its finally Friday!!! I am glad I have been extremely busy lately studying with my friend and co-worker Lissette for the CSET which is like HELL. (5 hour test on social studies, history, visual and performing arts, human development, Physical education, math, science, english, grammar-its a mixture of multiple choice and essay questions). We need to take the exam to be able to get our credential and start working. I am happy to say our studying has been going great and we are as I say killing...each section. I just pray that God give us patience and the knowledge to do well on test date (Jan 24).  I am also excited because I was able to see Sergio today. It was nice we went by the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and sat at a bench and looked at the sky and talked about what we have been reading in scripture and what we have been learning from God..through God. We had to come back because it got to cold.  I thank God because He has been blessing me in numerous ways. To mention one I have been blessed with a wonderful job. I just got another permanent assignment. I just pray everything works out.  Well just wanted to drop some lines got to go adios amigos y amigas.
