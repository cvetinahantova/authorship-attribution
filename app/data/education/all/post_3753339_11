Comments:  The less said about these two days, the better.  I got news so bad it left me in the "lacking will to get out of bed" stage.  Of course, I was unable to work on  anything , and the feeling of uselessness plus the feeling of guilt was a nasty combination.  My eating and sleeping became super irregular, so that was another nice feature.  I was almost completely reversed in terms of sleeping (i.e., I was sleeping all day and waking up around 5pm).   9P
