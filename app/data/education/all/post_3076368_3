...I don't have a whole lot to say, but I'm writing anyway.  This should NOT  become a pattern, but it is kind of fun.  Right now, I'm lamenting the fact that I'm VERY full, and I have an entire chocolate pie in the freezer that I REALLY want a piece of.  *sigh*  Oh yeah, and the Fullerton Revenue Patrol are now up there with the dentists.
