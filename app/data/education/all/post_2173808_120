Newsday  has my  urlLink take  on the legacy of the 9/11 commission.  Here's the gist of it:   "Why do these commissions usually fail in their task to bring consensus? One reason is that any commission, no matter how thorough and comprehensive, can't examine every piece of evidence. Indeed, new evidence often comes to light only long after these commissions complete their work. In other cases, the evidence will never be known. Oswald and the 9/11 hijackers took their thoughts to the grave. And into this vacuum of ignorance steps what historian Richard Hofstadter called "the paranoid style" of U.S. politics.   Many have always seen conspiracies lurking beneath the surface of American politics, but such thoughts are particularly evident in the wake of tragic events, as though something as horrible as 9/11 can only be the result of dark forces. Given this, the 9/11 report will not mark the end of, but just another stage in what will surely be an enduring controversy."
