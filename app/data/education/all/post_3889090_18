I wanted to avoid this for some reason, but I guess you can't escape God when doing philosophy. I need to know what will bring me maximum happiness, but trial and error isn't great and other people's suggestions might or might not work. This is not particularly satisfying. The other option is to ask someone who would know, and that person would be God. Well, does God exist, because if he does, I want to ask him what can make me happy. The notion of God is tied into my understanding of 'not me'. Here we go again, I hope this doesn't get circular...
