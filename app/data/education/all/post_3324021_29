I'm not so sure that there will be a class meeting tomorrow. I know that Gayle will be away on the field trip, but most of us I believe will still be at school. I'll be calling Gayle tonight to see what she wants us to talk about. Really, there isn't much to be said for the class, the end of the year is approaching, we are wrapping up things. From the looks of it, our budget is showing massive holes this year, before the dance we had a little under $700, when we started our term off with right around $3000, I would say this years profit margin will be about -$2000. To review what we did this year, we started off with about 1,500 from leftover Class of 2003 funds. Homecoming costs hit us big, countering our profits from the freshman mixer. A November conference put a little hole in our pocket, the rose sale covered up that loss. Then the big Traverse City conference took out a chunk of change which the Spring Dance surely won't be able to counter. As we wrap up the year, we have a special surprise coming your way, plus we will be working on our banner for the incoming freshman, and putting together a binder for them to use as a model when they start-up their government. Feel free to post any of your comments!
