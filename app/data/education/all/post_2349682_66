Three days without my depression medicine so far so good. I mean I think I cry more now than I did when I was on the medicine, it doesn't seem right. Praise God though because I am sleeping, something that I was worried about. I even get some naps during the day, well not lately because the boys are in VBS and Camp this week. I thank all of you who are praying for me, it helps to know that I have the support.  I was kind of embarrassed because in the prayer email that was written to the whole church it says that I have rheumatiod arthritis in my eyes, it just sounds funny. It is affecting my eyes but I don't think that eyes have joints. So for that I go see a doctor tomorrow. When I called to get an appointment the lady I was talking to asked what the deal was I told her I have arthritis, I don't know if she didn't believe me or what because she was like "how old are you?" I'm 24. Oh, and then she went on asking questions. I guess that I don't sound old enough to have arthritis. Don't look it or sound it, great for me!! Tonight we had a waterballon/water gun fight with the youth at Freestone Park, well everyone else did I ran away. It was kind of windy and cold, I didn't want to get wet. Angela, Amy, and I were watching an obedience school for German shepherds being held and we were far away on a hill from the water, we were safe so I thought. I could see Robert and Steve coming with a bucket, Angela and I started getting up to get away. I thought they were going after Angela we were both screaming I think, they went after me! I was like don't make me run, don't get me wet!! Those boys brought an empty bucket, they are so mean!  Another cute thing was that there were a couple of people who were like Cela isn't wet yet, Andy and Zach were like you leave her alone don't get her tonight. They were watching out for me, isn't that awesome?!
