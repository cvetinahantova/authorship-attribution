Lostprophets- Burn Burn    Where do I begin? With this life we're living in, Market youth their uniform,  Make us all fit in... But do you think that we're that blind? And we can't see through all your lies?  Cos it's no good (Burn Burn the station) We'll burn it down (Burn Burn the truth) Enjoy the flames (In celebration) Enjoy the sound (For us, for them, for you)  I know that I've been told My integrity was sold Priced and placed upon a shelf, It's worth its weight in gold... But do you think we've lost our minds? And we can't see through all your lies?  Cos it's no good (Burn Burn the station) We'll burn it down (Burn Burn the truth) Enjoy the flames (In celebration) Enjoy the sound (For us, for them, for you)  Burn Burn the truth, the lies, the news, Burn Burn the life that you can't choose, Burn Burn the hate that gets you through, Burn Burn for us, for them, for you...    (x9)  Cos it's no good (Burn Burn the station) We'll burn it down (Burn Burn the truth) Enjoy the flames (In celebration) Enjoy the sound (For us, for them, for you)  For us, for them, for you... (x5)   This song is so totally amazing it's unbelievable- I just want to listen to it all day long, and it's gonna be sooo cool live... it's totally cheered up my day from my shitty mood earlier  Can't wait for the show Ceff x
