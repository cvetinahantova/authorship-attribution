Today  urlLink The Presurfer  links to  urlLink Cosplay.com , an internet community of people who dress up as their favorite anime characters.  I'm not an expert on Anime, but what exposure I have had to the artform seems to indicate a peculiar fascination with white people; despite being quintessentially Japanese, there is a notable lack of recognizably Japanese characters.  Whatever this means, and I realize it could mean a lot of different things, there is an odd effect to seeing white people dressed as japanese versions of white people.  This exaggeration of the features, along with the satiny, revealing costumes themselves, the fetishistic qualities of so much effort going into so marginal (or at least uncommon) an interest, it makes the whole thing feel vaguely pornographic.    It doesn't help that the featured girls are sisters (21 and 18, respectively), that they hold each other in intimate poses, or that there is an innocence to this whole endeavor that seems obliviously virginal.  Am I way off here?  Know more about this than I do?  Please share.
