so i went downstairs tonight to see if there was anything of mine still down there and i noticed a pile of cd's.  suspicious that they were mine, i looked, and indeed they were.  while i've been at work, i guess shea has been taking my cd's and burning all of them without asking me.  i'm kind of upset about it.  one, he didn't ask me if he could borrow them and burn them.  two, i'm protective of my music.  i feel like i really understand and relate to all of my music and it makes me mad when people act like they can relate to it when they've never experienced what the songs are about.  not saying that he doesn't, but to share my music with someone, i have to feel like i can trust them, in a way...if that makes sense.  he's not even talking to me...this is just another way he's using me before i leave.  i'm sick of being used.
