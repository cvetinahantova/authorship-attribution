last night...  me: dad!  what are these giant bugs on the stairs to my room? dad: can't you just ignore them? me: can't you come see what they are and make them go outside? dad: (comes over...): those are just cave crickets -- can't you ignore them? me: can't i live in a house without bugs for a week dad: you're in the South -- we have big bugs; it's part of the deal, enjoy it. me: there are plenty of houses in the south without bugs... can you please make them go away? dad: they're not coming in your room -- they're just on the stairs, go see. me: (go up to my room) dad!  there's 2 up here, please do something about them! dad: (chases them into my closet) me: dude, i'm not 3 anymore dad:  I  can't see them anymore though... you're fine... good night.  back to the usual.  am i ridiculous to not want bugs the size of the palm of my hand bouncing around my room at night?  blah -- this could be why i choose to stay far far away most of the time :-P  later dudes :-P
