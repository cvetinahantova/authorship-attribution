You all did such a great job yesterday out there in hilly La Jolla!  I know, I know, you didn't know about the hills, but you conquered them like true women.  Next time we send you out on a hilly course (and yes, there will be more, ladies), say to yourself, "Hill?  What hill?  I don't see any hills."...eventually your legs and lungs will catch up with your words!      Following is information about this Sunday's run.  After the run, there will be an injury prevention clinic presented by Dr. David Revivo, Chiropractor and nice guy!    What:  6 mile out-and-back course    When:   Sunday, August 1st              RUNNERS:  Meet @ 7:15 for 7:30 start.                WALKERS:  If you want to start earlier, meet at 7:00 a.m.  I will be there by 7:00 with maps.    Where:  Doyle Park, UTC area    Directions:     I-5 Fwy.  Exit at La Jolla Village Drive and head east.  Turn right on Regents Road.  Park is on your left just past Nobel Rd.    Have a great week!  Remember, feel free to contact your mentor with any questions or concerns.    Wendy
