I have filled anoter seat on my plane to the research station on Antarctica.   I saw a clip of Rick Santorum's infamous comments about homosexuals. Three weeks or so after Trent Lott made his unfortunate remarks about Strom Thurmond, Santorum likened homosexuality to incest and bestiality. But unlike Lott's comments, Santorum had the decency to make his comments to the AP.  And unlike Lott, nothing happened to Santorum. Not even so much a rebuke. Just shows that in this country, homosexuals are still firmly in the underclass.  Heres Santorum's comments in full:   AP:  I mean, should we outlaw homosexuality?   SANTORUM:  I have no problem with homosexuality. I have a problem with homosexual acts. As I would with acts of other, what I would consider to be, acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships. And that includes a variety of different acts, not just homosexual. I have nothing, absolutely nothing against anyone who's homosexual. If that's their orientation, then I accept that. And I have no problem with someone who has other orientations. The question is, do you act upon those orientations? So it's not the person, it's the person's actions. And you have to separate the person from their actions.   AP:  OK, without being too gory or graphic, so if somebody is homosexual, you would argue that they should not have sex?   SANTORUM:  We have laws in states, like the one at the Supreme Court right now, that has sodomy laws and they were there for a purpose. Because, again, I would argue, they undermine the basic tenets of our society and the family. And if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does. It all comes from, I would argue, this right to privacy that doesn't exist in my opinion in the United States Constitution ****************************  See kids, religion makes you crazy,  For what it's worth, the homosexual community is now pushing to have the word Santorum included in the common parlance. Here is the definition of Santorum:  Santorum: The frothy mix of lubricant and fecal matter that is sometimes a byproduct of anal sex.
