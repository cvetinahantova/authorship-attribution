So much news today I don't even know where to begin.  First, you may have noticed a few changes... Yes, I couldn't resist the zingy new templates. I tried to stave off the temptation of their clean lines and pretty colours, but I just couldn't help myself. They made eyes at me and whimpered like labrador puppies in a pet shop window, and I caved like the big ol' sissy I am. Unfortunately the Haloscan commenting is gone, and I can't backdate the new system, but have no fear- I have all your witty repartee stored neatly away in a Word file at the back of my hard drive. I will look back on it fondly, one day when I am really, really bored.  Thanks be to Chris, who deployed his razor-sharp HTML acumen to help me restore my links, and has therefore been rewarded with his own. I trust he'll be changing his URL as soon as he reads this, so get there while you can.  Today Carla came in and boosted up my ego no end. She said lovely things about my monoprinting lesson and, although she disappointingly didn't wink at anyone today, she did redeem herself by  telling me off  for working too hard!  Apparently I'm destined for some kind of embolism if I carry on working till 1am every night. Who knew? I have been told to limit my dedication to more sensible hours, and so I shall. As of tomorrow I shall be not so much teacher as Zen Master. A veritable Art and Design Jedi, suffused with calmness, and serenity, and the ability to move small starfighters using only the power of my mind.  Do, or do not. There is no try.
