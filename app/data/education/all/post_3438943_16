Just purchased Dean Koontz's new book- The Taking.  Since first finding his web site I have known about this book and have been waiting atleast six monthes.  Also picked up a second dvd play so i can have one in the bedroom and one in the living room where my tread mill is.  Today is going much better than yesterday- even feeling better too.  More commentary re: the taking to follow shortly.  Probably won't get anything else done till the book is finished.
