you pass people that you don't know and they smile at you.  little old men strike up conversations about the weather.  it's sunny out.  i have a great conversation with someone.  i feel happy.  i feel like i have made a difference.  people make an effort to do something with me.  someone enjoys my company.  people understand me.  i hear from an old friend.  i make a new friend.  i find old pictures from my childhood.  i have a wonderful dream.  i don't have to answer to anyone.  you first start dating someone and you get butterflies thinking about them and a feeling that maybe you won't be alone forever.  i can read someone correctly.  a song i've been dying to hear comes on the radio.  i get mix cd's.  i get new gadgets and open new cd's.  my sisters are around.  i feel energetic and alive.  i get to sleep naked.  no one is around and i turn up my music super loud and dance.  i watch a good movie.  i get snail mail.  someone has been thinking of me and does something special for no reason besides the fact that they wanted to.  people want to know about me or have an interest in me.  i build something.  i take something apart and put it back together.  my dad makes waffles on sundays.  a restaurant has deep fried mushrooms.  i beat a game.  i'm winning.  i feel successful.  people are honest.  people don't keep the truth from me because they are afraid to hurt me.  others listen.  it's a beautiful day out.  there's a thunderstorm.  karma works.
