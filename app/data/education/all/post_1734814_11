Why do all these forums/blogspots have automatic entries that we can't control. Just decided to review my profile since it has been some time since I first filled it out. Why do I automatically get told what my star sign is and what chinese year i was born in?? If I'm interested, I'd know already, and quite frankly I'd rather not have it up there. Sour grapes I know but I still haven't got that coffee...
