A decidedly Sundayish feeling to today. I hate Sundays. Not just because it’s the day before Monday, cos, let’s face it, that’s how things have been since Gregory invented the calendar and if we haven’t got used to it by now there’s a problem somewhere. It’s just that they’re so  disappointing.    In the movies Sundays (and therefore also, I guess, bank holidays) begin with your being woken up by golden sunshine pouring through the window, or by some unfeasibly beautiful women stirring at your side, or by a shaggy dog jumping on the bed. You spend Sundays playing chess in the park with old Jewish men who bring along breadcrumbs for the pigeons, or drinking coffee on terraces with people in corduroy, or Guinness in charming pubs which are showing the football, but no-one is watching it. At any given time during all of these activities you will always have slightly mussed hair and perfectly even stubble. You will wear sloppy sweat tops and holey jeans in which you will look  just fantastic.  This is what Sunday is about. It is the law.  So how come, then, on any given Sunday round my house, we lurk in our rooms doing work all morning, emerging bleary-eyed and grumpy about 2ish, do some washing up and the hoovering, eat a pizza, watch whatever dreck Channel 4 have decided this week is a cinematic classic, discuss our mild disappointment, and go to bed?   I’m starting a campaign for More Exciting Sundays. Who’s with me?  Just me then.  OK.
