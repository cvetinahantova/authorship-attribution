Helloooooo!  Well in case you haven't guessed by the lack of my blogs I have been on holiday. Nowhere nice, just sitting at home, but I thought I should take a break from computers as well. I have lots of catching up to do - good news, bad news and lots of events to tell you all about, so stay tuned for the updates.
