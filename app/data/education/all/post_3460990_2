Okay, so I've actually been thinking about starting my own Blog for a while now, especially since so many of my friends are geographically far away. However, what really pushed me to finally do it was a conversation I had with a friend from Texas about two weeks ago. It made me realize that I am about to reinvent myself (again) and it would be an interesting thing to chronicle this journey from the beginning.   Soooo, what's a girl to do when she decides to move her life in an entirely new direction? That's right, get a new haircut! So, wanting to have my newly found direction benefit others, I went out last week and donated most of the length of my hair (over 12 inches) to a charity called Locks of Love, which makes and distributes wigs for children who have no hair due to illness. Pictures to be posted..eventually. So far, short hair is really nice. New York is just starting to get hot and sticky, and this is making it much more tolerable.  Shoutouts...congrats to AmyKatPat, who earned her Master's degree last week. You're awesome, and I'm so proud of you! Holly, I am so glad you have free airline miles, and I'll see you in July!  In other life news...I find out the scores for my teacher certification exams on Friday and my university assignment through the Fellows program in roughly two weeks. And since the New York City Teaching Fellows program will be what I eat, sleep and breathe from this point forward, I have no other information to relay.
