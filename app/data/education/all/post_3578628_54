"It's a school full of so-called at-risk children. It's how we,  unfortunately, label certain children. It means basically they  can't learn.  ...  It's one of the best schools in Houston."     So he thinks that "at-risk" means "can't learn?"  And that one of the best schools in Houston is filled with students that can't learn? What an idiot.
