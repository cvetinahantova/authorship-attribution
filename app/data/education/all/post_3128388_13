I've done absolutely nothing more than simply mow the lawn and do some typing up and inventing of History homework today. Still, only one week left until summer school :).  Went shopping yesterday, brought "Monty Python Sings" and all three Lord of the Rings soundtracks, they're all very good, only one funny. I also got the penultimate Star Wars NJO book and the latest issue of Private Eye. I was tempted by a number of things in HMV as well, such as a Wurzles album; I was looking for Weird Al but he weren't  there :(. Tom Clatworthy was however. Must dash, get on the phone to Becca before school tomorrow; one of the 1000 people in school, and 100 so much luckier people on Warwick SS. It'd be really interesting to be there.
