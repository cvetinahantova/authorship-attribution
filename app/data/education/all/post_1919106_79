Crazy week so far   I don't know what's wrong, but it seems like everyone I know (including myself) has some or another sort of problem this week. If The Lady has any hand in this, and I suspect she does - always meddling in people's affairs she is (but she's my deity and I love her a lot, thank you very much), then she'd better make up for it next week, or she will have a very... Upset... Follower. Sure, she's already made up for it in my case, but I certainly won't just stand there and watch while she toys around with my friends' lives.  Anyway, today at work we figured out why  Trogdor  was acting up - It turns out that it has a bad memory module. We've turned it off for the moment, and Evan is going to run the Dell diagnostics on it tomorrow (even though we already know that it's faulty... That's what  memtest86  is for) and ask them to get it replaced. Apart from that, we didn't get much done. I brought  Boondock Saints  to work today, and Evan just cracked up at the cat scene. He loved the movie, and just  had  to show it to his wife.
