It was presented at Living the future II, Organizational changes for success, April 21-24, 1998, The University of Arizona Library, Tucson, Arizona.  From the site:   Abstract    The "Assessment Plan for Information Literacy" at Indiana University Bloomington asserts the need for the teaching faculty to form partnerships with librarians to ensure an acceptable level of information literacy for all students. Several projects for implementing the plan will be presented, along with a case study on one School.    Paper    Our presentation this afternoon will be divided into three parts. First, I will describe the Indiana University "Assessment Plan for Information Literacy," which was adopted in 1996. Then, I will update you on our general progress in implementing the plan over the past two years. Then Erla Heyns will provide specific information about the challenges of implementing the plan in one school, Health, Physical Education, and Recreation.
