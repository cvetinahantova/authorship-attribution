First up, qppologies to all those whom I should have contacted by now, My phone won't work and my email has stopped working, aside from this crap internet workstation that contiki offers "for a fee", i have no other way of contacting anyone, specially because access to payphones is limited to the hours where we stop off in a city somewhere, I feel so isolated.  So can someone please contact sarah or my home to tell Laurie what the story is.  Sorry, I really cant write much its too frustrating. The keys on the keyboards at this workstation are totally different layout from normal.  Banking is hard here I am having dificulty trying to transfer money back to New Zealand, and because I owe some friends money and an overdue to pay it back, I an starting to stress a little.
