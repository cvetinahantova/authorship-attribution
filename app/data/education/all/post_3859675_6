I don’t know why but the day seems strange to me. I wish I had something fun to do. But all is good because God is good. I mean he has been teaching me about love. Not just the simple lines everyone knows,   “Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” 1 Corinthians 13: 5-7  I wanted to dig deeper and have spent the last week looking for a verse that talked about love in more detail, but all I had to do was read down to a few verses.   “If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.” 1 Corinthians 13:1-3  These are simple words and phases that tell what love is supposed to be. But the question I have been asking is how do I love? How can I dig deeper into understanding this? I think I have found an answer, or a good idea. I need to start loving others. But now the question is how do I start loving others. The only thing that comes to my mind is to be kind, understanding, and to live in the truth as verse 5-7 suggest.  My goal is changing for this summer, now I want to learn to love others, and the way to do this is my getting out more and allowing myself to have more fellowship. I think I am on the right path, just hate waiting but I know Christ will carry me during the hardest times.
