Mood:  Calm, Happy...getting ready for revision  Listening To: Avril's New Album, which is pretty good, no *bad* songs, then again I mark for Avril so..  WOW, Alots sorta happened since Tuesday..   Wednesday  Cinema, saw Harry Potter, not too bad, wasnt really a kid-ish film, nice plot tho there wasnt really any substance in terms of what happened, no voltemort....the next film will rawk tho.  Went with Aidan, Dan(from Ball Boys, FIT, eyed me up loads...¬.¬), Kate, Claire (Who's been having phone sex with Dan...), Nicole and Jen, cool bunch of guys. Met at 12.30, left at like 8, chatted for ages, was cool though.   Thursday  Planned to meet Ryan, nice guy, tho I didnt feel anything, disliked his accent and general looks, mm I'm too picky. Got the 270 home, kenw I'd pass Jo's dads shop which she'd be working at so I gave her a call. Got a strange text from someone called Dan wich i later worked out who it was (15/m/nearish me). We had tons of fun and took LOOOOOAAAADSS of pics, some of which are on faceparty  urlLink which you can click here to see .  Jo's amazingly cool.   Friday   Usual Wated Day (c). Heh, sorta okish day played on PC, Downloaded new Avril Album and Maroon 5. Wanna get Lost Prophets, prolly get it today and leave the comp to download it.  lol, THAT was Friday.   The Weekend Ahead....   REVISION.......doubtful, I need to get some done tho, It would be a real shame if I dont.   Bah, I really like Jayson.... :/
