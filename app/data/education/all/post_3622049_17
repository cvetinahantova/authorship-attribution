I'm finally back home.  After seven weeks of travel I am back in my own little apartment.  The little one is back with her dad, so now I'm having a nice alcholic smoothie.  I don't drink when the little one is around so it's been about two months since the last time I had one. Travel can be terrible but occasionaly inspiring.  Like having a new title for a story pop in your head because you've finally been able to sit and not think about anything else. This weekend is my sister's babyshower.  This is her third and suposedly last child.  I am excited about this one, because now we live so much closer.   I feel like I can be more of a part of the whole thing.  It's nice to plan for a little one. We didn't plan for my little one.  It was very much a let's not talk about it thing.  I'm having a hard time tonight.  It's an adjustment.  I don't like having my world changed.  Now I just don't want to think for a while.
