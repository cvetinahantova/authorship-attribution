this quote made me think long and hard...  'in friendship, as in love, we are often more happy from the things we are ignorant of than from those we are acquainted with.' -fracois de la rochefoucauld  ain't that true from time to time?  maybe that's why i'm terribly enjoying my relationships (friendships and romantically-inclined) these days...i'm ignorant in some aspects as i am immersed in the experience of knowing these people...i just want them to know that they're opening up worlds in me i wouldn't be aware of had they not come into my life...and i'm a better person for having known their thoughts and sharing in their lives.  to the people who matter, i value you.
