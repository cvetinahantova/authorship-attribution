Mmmm. Pimm's. My mum brought a bottle home to try out for the party, and I have fallen in love with it- Pimm's is now my official drink of choice, especially how I had it earlier, with ice cubes, strawberries and apple. Mmmm.  I went into Birmingham with Kat yesterday. We had loads of fun; I laughed and laughed and laughed, and as ever I missed all the JYF peeps as soon as we went our separate ways, but again I was left with that feeling of total inadequacy that the JYF girls seem to give me. I think they're all great and lovely and stuff, but I always feel so fat and unattractive next to them, and that my personality is dull and boring in comparison to theirs. They do fun stuff, go out to cool clubs, dress in really funky clothes and generally seem to have a lot more fun than I do. It doesn't really help that I swear I've put on weight recently- it's all this sitting around the house, doing nothing except writing and eating Jaffa Cakes.  I tried on some bikini shorts in Marks & Spencer yesterday and my legs looked hideous: all lumpy and blotchy and flabby and disgusting. I will be surprised if, when I get to Italy this Summer, if I don't clear the beach of holiday-makers at the sight of my horrible white pins, or at least make them throw up into their beach bags. Blegh blegh BLEGH.  Due to the horror experienced by the sight of my disgusting, horrible, vomit-inducing body shape, mum and I decided to go swimming this morning, with the intention of making it a regular thing. But as it always is with us, our plan was unsuccessful. The University baths were closed from midday, and the Gala baths aren't open yet after some silly person set them on fire (incidentally, how do you set a swimming pool on fire? It's made of water!), so instead we went to Ann's (Godmother's) house and sat in the garden eating pretzels. Gah.  Ceff x   Obviously, she's out of my league...
