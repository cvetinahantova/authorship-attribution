So, I have just spent some time reading the  urlLink user comments  on a website called  urlLink RateMyTeachers.com  and the bulk of the comments are negative.  Many of the users question the site's validity and many feel it is simply an open forum for students to bash their teachers.  I agree.  How many 11 or 12-year-olds (or 17-year-olds for that matter) do you know that can actually give a fair assessment of a teacher?  There are many teachers out there that are tough, but fair.  Do you think they will receive a "smiley face" on this site?  Probably not.  Did I receive a bad rating?  Am I a big, fat whiner?  Do I really care what my students think about me?  Eh.  At the end of the day, you have to realize that you are going to tick off some of these kids - many of whom came to school in a rotten mood because of something that happened at home.  I have to wonder if there are libel issues at stake here.  I also have to wonder how long a website called RateMyStudents.com would be allowed to stay up before parents were threatening to sue.    It is only the ignorant who despise education.   Publilus Syrus     Thank you, Janeane Garofalo for a notable quotable: Dubya is "cocky with Christ"  - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart
