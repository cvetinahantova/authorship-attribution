Weekend of Hell and Heaven   Time to catch up again. Well, probably the only thing I have to say in my defense now is that there was no chance for me to blog from where I was. So, let's start then: *  Wednesday night  - Went over to Jeff and Tracy's, met Shawn. Interesting guy, knows a lot about music. Has a neat Giger deck too.  *  Thursday  - Off to Deer Camp. Got there early afternoon, went out to track some deer, didn't shoot anything (except for beer cans & bottles), got rip-roaring drunk, passed out.  *  Friday  - Got up early to hunt deer, sat in the blind for 10 minutes, then everyone decided to go back and take a nap. Agonized the entire morning due to a hangover. Andy arrived. Went for a trek to the old foxhole. Got back, had dinner, got slightly drunk, saw lots of shooting stars, passed out.  *  Saturday  - Got up not so early, had breakfast, went for a hike up the hill by the pig pen. Got back, Chuck arrived, the others went hunting, we decided to get drunk before everyone got back in case they got a deer and wanted us to help clean... The rest is a blur, but I remember my "cool" idea of using an electric fan to fan up the bonfire (and it worked like a charm too), and that Evan promised to throw a party at the end of the semester to which everyone at the Anime Club is invited. *  Sunday  - Actually got up early, packed up while Chuck and Andy and Tony were hunting, finished packing, Chuck got back with a 9 point (and for some reason an extra leg), we left. Got back home, had a shower, went with the girls to Jo-ann's and then to World Market, went to Tracy's, got back, passed out.
