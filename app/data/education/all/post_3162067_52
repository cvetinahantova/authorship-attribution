One more week to go, one more week to go!! Thank GOD because I am almost faint with exhaustion at the moment. Had an ok time in London yesterday. The job looks like it could be quite enjoyable, although I don't think the interview went spectacularly well. I'm sure I'll do better once I've broken up from work as I'm always so shattered come interview day. Went to Harrods for more Krispey Kremes (had to queue for 30 minutes!!!!) and went to the Natural History Museum to take a picture of Dorcas for Si...and was very scared by all the animals. Got back at about midnight feeling suddenly overwhelmed by all of this, and having spent at least an hour on the train fighting back tears. This morning Si and I overslept. This evening, we're planning our wedding!
