I knew it was coming, but I didn't know just how confusing and boorish the whole situation would be. Bill Clinton has now released his memoirs (or book of lies as I call it), and the entire media is in a frenzy. However, it isn't all orgasmic like it was when he was president. Some folks are just fainting in the aisles to get his signature, while others, like the  New York Times , are panning his book in order to take him out of the limelight.    Poor John Kerry can't get a word in edgewise! I can just see him standing outside of the pool of light that Bill Clinton is hogging, waving his arms around trying to get people to look him with his "Lurch" face and listen to his ever-changing message. I swear, he has no original ideas of his own. He has no vision. He's just an aging hippie whose causes have all died of starvation.  But back to Billy Clinton...  He was on  60 Minutes  last night. Don't ask me about the interview because I didn't watch it. An entire hour of Bill Clinton and his shiny red alcoholic nose would just about put me into convulsions. I do have my health to think about. However, I did see the clips on Fox News this morning as well as several interviews by PR pros. The interview was like a watching a T-ball game. There were no really hard hits, no one was running the right way to chase down the ball, and everyone was overly concerned that no one's feelings got hurt. Ick. I don't know why Dan Rather (whose suit matched Bill Clinton's perfectly) didn't just get down on his knees then and there. Then again, that may have happened after filming wrapped. You know how kinky Clinton can be, and I bet he's not getting any from the ice maiden either. I hear she's running for president soon, but that's a topic for another blog.
