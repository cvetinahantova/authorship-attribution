Some educators argue that we learn much more from our failures than from our successes. Why? They believe that we should put students in situations where their hypotheses or predictions fail. Can you think of a situation in which you learned a lot from a mistake?  Not so much a mistake but a failure.  In music, students are often put into situations where they don't succeed as well as they had hoped.  It is these "failures" that make us challenge ourselves to greater success.  For example, when I was an 8th grade music student, I tried out for All-Region band.  There were 93 trumpets that tried out that year.  After the tryouts, I placed 80 out of 93 (NOT TOO GOOD!!).  I would consider that a failure...I did then and I still do.  After that, I learned what I could do to increase my chances for success.  I started taking private lessons, began to practice more, and prepared myself better for the next year.  The next year's tryouts came and 112 trumpets tried out and I placed 1st out of 112.  I would consider that a success....did then and still do.  So, I learned from a failure and turned it into a positive learning experience for me.  I have seen it in my own students as well...success can come from failure.  BC
