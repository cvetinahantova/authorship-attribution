This blogger thing is a lot different now I sure hope I know what I am doing. Well today I didn't get up till one, isn't that sad?! I didn't know that I was even that tired! It's funny eating breakfast at one, lunch at 4 and dinner at 7 what a good eating schedule. School is done hooray! I am off for three weeks! It's amazing how rest is really so important and how sometimes we forget to do it. I want to just go and party all day but most of my friends work. This isn't high school anymore, even in high school I would wait till Sharon got off work to do stuff.
