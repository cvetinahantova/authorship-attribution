Karl was in town last night ad it was great to see him.  Having Jay, Kyle, Karl, and myself get together was like old times, and a whole lot of fun.  Even though it was like old times, it really was like new times.  All of our life situations are so "adult" now.  Whether we talk about marriage, homeownership, or our jobs, it always seems to be the things my parents used to talk about when I was little.  But this is a good thing we all know.  Each chapter of life presents a new and exciting challenge and goal for us to accomplish.  As long as we head in a direction of some sort, we will do well.  And almost all of the original crew have done well.  Nothing is perfect, but manhood looks good on all of the original bunch of idiots who chose to hang out together over ten years ago.  What is next for this intrepid bunch?  We'll chat...
