Anyone who says that chocolate and PB isn't the perfect combination is just plain crazy. It cures all that ails you, and I just ate way too much of it tonight. Not that it was all that bad of a day (it wouldn't have been sweets I was downing but a whole lot of something alcoholic had it been that bad) but some days the PB and chocolate chips are just calling to me from the cabinet, know what I mean?  So, clearly, there's not much new or exciting to report...things with the hubby are better, though we didn't really talk much more about anything. Sometimes even I realize that I can talk things to death. We're just so tired, and God knows this full-time parenting thing can take its toll on just about anyone! Buttons have been pushed left and right around our house lately...okay, time for some cuddle time before bed.  I'm not sure I'll be able to write much 'till next week, since we have about 45 people coming on Saturday for a BBQ and surprise retirement party for my dad (at least I can get my drink on!) and my best friend/almost sister is coming in for the weekend tomorrow. Yay! Hope everyone out there has a great weekend!
