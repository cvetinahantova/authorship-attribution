Greetings in the name of Jesus!  this Tuesday and Wednesday, i spent the school day playing with 1st graders and kindergardeners respectively through the YMCA Fun Bus. OH MY GOSH, they are so cute!  i saw a lot of my King's Club kids there too. most of them are 2nd graders or older, but i had some kindergardeners today. it was good to see them, and they actually recognized me. i made some new friends too, but i'm biast to my kids first. OH I MISS THEM!   seeing them a few times a week, through the program and home visits will leave the deepest of memories with me. it really makes me thing what kind of work/ministry should i persue? i know that where i am now is exactly where God wants me, but how do i figure out where He wants me to be in the future, or how to get there? i feel really slow when it comes to hearing and listening to His voice.   i am so grateful that in the midst of looking for a job and finding direction, God provides me with simple loves and joys. may i continue to live and be a blessing to everyone i encounter. all things in His great timing.  By His grace and mercy, Gill
