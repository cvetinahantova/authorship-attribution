Well, this week, I am so tried of summer break. I am just waiting for school to begin so I can have a small break. I mean I need something more to do then just taking the kids (nephew Kevin age 6, niece Trinity age 4) to the movies, and figuring out more about my computer. Today we saw the “Cat in the Hat,” I didn’t like it.   My best friend and fellow brother in the Lord, Owen, has gone on a weeklong mission trip to Mexico. He went with some others from his church, Lighthouse. He left Saturday and should be back latter this week. I hope all goes well for him.  I went to church Sunday morning and found out that my pastor, Pastor Jim, has asked the church board for a 6 month leave because of health related problems. I know Pastor Jim has been sick before and he had an accident a few weeks ago and that has not helped him. The church board has granted his leave and now he is at home, I think, healing and getting better.
