From the satirical webzine  urlLink The Onion :    urlLink CIA Asks Bush to Discontiue Blog     urlLink    WASHINGTON, DC—In the interest of national security, President Bush has been asked to stop posting entries on his three-month-old personal web log, acting CIA director John E. McLaughlin said Monday.   According to McLaughlin, several recent entries on PrezGeorgeW. typepad.com have compromised military operations, while other posts may have seriously undercut the PR efforts of White House press secretary Scott McClellan.  A July 24 posting read, "Just got back from a lunch with Colin and Adil Moussa (one of Prince Saud al-Faisal's guys). Colin wants the Saudis to send some troops to Najaf—so some of the soldiers are Arab, I guess. This Moussa guy sure wears a lot of jewelry. A golden chain, a golden ring with his initials or something, and some other sparkling stuff—kinda effeminate. Anyway, best of luck in Iraq, Iyad."  McLaughlin, normally hesitant to express public disapproval of the president, said the blog was "ill-advised."  Funny stuff. Thanks to  urlLink Rudy Carrasco  for the link.  P.S. Yes, there really is a weblog at  urlLink PrezGeorgeW.typepad.com .
