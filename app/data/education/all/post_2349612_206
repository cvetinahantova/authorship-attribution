so jessica's dad drove farther than we guessed today and she can't make the movie tomorrow since he'll be getting in several hours earlier than planned -- oops!  this means we'll take a rain check... so it goes.  on the other hand, not having to be up by 9am, i decided to go ahead and finish posting all the trip pictures i planned to post... all 79 ones i've posted from the last 2 weeks are online now... same link as last post...  really, now, 3am, i should get some sleep or i'll be noctural this weekend and my guests won't be!  doht!  night! =P
