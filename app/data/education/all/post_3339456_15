Well, it looks like the 1 year US exemption from ICC prosecution for US peacekeepers on UN forces  urlLink won't be extended .  No wonder, after what has been revealed in recent weeks.    They should never have been given immunity in the first place.  It is a travesty of international protection of human rights that such an exemption was allowed in the first place.  It reveals how power politics at its worst and most cynical can play out in international affairs.    China won't vote for it because it sets the wrong example, which is kind of a hypocritical thing for them to say, but the important thing is that it will not pass.  Good for  urlLink Kofi Annan  as well, taking a stand against this measure.  Note the US puppets who are voting in favour -- Britan, the Philippines, Russia, and Angola.  Pakistan and Algeria are pondering whether to break the bond.       One step, but a small one, toward ending US arrogance and militarism on the world stage.
