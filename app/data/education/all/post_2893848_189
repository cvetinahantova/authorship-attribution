Vamos   The Pixies have extended their reunion tour, and I was able to get tix for the Chicago show in November for $590 less than $625.  (Actually, when you factor in all those fees Ticketmaster makes up, it was more like $580 less.)  To all my Chicago people:  hope to see you there, November 13.  The tickets just went on sale today, so there are probably some still available if you move fast.  I was looking through the comment threads, and I am glad to say I have finally pissed someone off (though apparently mildly).  Maybe glad isn't quite the word; I'm not particularly proud or ashamed of the post in question.  I don't think it is is worth either apologizing for or defending, so I'm not going to do either.  But hey, a comment is a comment, and I'm always glad to get one.  I used to take a lot of pleasure in being offensive.  My old band even made a minor, local career out of conscientiously pissing off our audience.  People used to say things to me like, "I love you, but you're an asshole," or just, "you're (such) an asshole."  I was fine with this.  Maybe I just liked the attention; maybe I was simply immature.  But in my own mind, it was a question of rebellion, of struggling to set myself apart in a subculture that claimed to be about individuality but was really as viciously uniform as a fraternity during pledge week.  I was so proud of myself.  I was a self-appointed inquisitor to the punk scene, and quite obnoxious.  In retrospect, anyone who did like me probably managed to do so despite my self-conscious efforts rather than because of them.  (Something that is maybe true of all good friends in all situations.)     I've lost the fire, thank God, but I'm still willing to say things I don't mean if I think they're funny or otherwise worth saying.  Perhaps this is a bad habit.  Depending on my mood, I will pick a fight from either side of a question.  Maybe being contrary isn't a problem so much as being ornery and contrary at the same time.
