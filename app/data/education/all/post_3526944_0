Well, I just found out that the bill to fix my car to pass inspection will be $500. I hate living in a state that inspects cars. Plus, I drive a pretty nice car, and I see beaters driving all over my neighborhood that pass inspection without problem...makes me wonder if I'm being held to a higher standard because I drive a newer car...if they think I have the money, their terribly mistaken.
