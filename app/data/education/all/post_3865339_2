I think that the main point of this article was to provide positive reasoning for including computers in the elementary school classroom.  The article discussed how upper-elementary students were using computers in their classrooms.  Of course it toucher on the skepticism that some educators have about integrating computer use in the curriculum.  It talked about how students used the computers to write short stories, prepare web pages and power point presentations, and use a photo application program.  For example, it was stated that the use of word processing for writing short stories benefited students that had difficulty with writing.  There were teachers that were skeptical about using computers in the classroom, arguing that they had no use for them and that students were not ready for the computer applications.  But according to the article, students were enthusiastic, very helpful, and knowledgable about using the computers.  Teahcers seemed at first apprehensive because they did not want the computers to replace actual teaching in the classroom but later realized that computers are a resource, not a replacement.  This article was interesting because it talked about how educators are divided on the issue of integrating computers in the curriculum.  Being that I have dealt with computers so much, I feel they are important to use but should not take the place of what is taught in the classroom.  The author discussed how the power point presentations that the students prepared were flashy and he was not very impressed.  In  that instance, I agree that the presentations had no true educational basis except to teach the students how to use power point.  It would have been more beneficial to have the students prepare presentations based on a particular subject area.  That, I believe, is how computers should be used in the classroom.
