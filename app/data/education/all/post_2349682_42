We had a great night with the college group last night, after group some of us went to Canyon Lake to go swimming. Well it was chilly out so I already knew that I probally wasn't going to get in. I didn't prepare for the fact that I would get motion sickness on the way. I don't know what happened, I'm usually not one to get sick but I did. Mandy and Amy were in the back of John's truck screaming like crazy girls and the first time we stopped a cop came up after we had parked and asked, "Why are we screaming people?" How old are you all? We are all over 21 (we forgot that Steve was only 20), but then Mandy raises her hand and tells the cop, "I was the one screaming, I am a 29 year old mom and I don't get out much!" Amy did the same thing, it was funny. I was glad he didn't ask if we were drinking or anything because I had just got done throwing up in the bush. I'm sorry that's gross, huh? But it was fun watching Mandy, Susie, Amy, Jen, and Obie pretend not to be cold while they were swimming. John and Steve started throwing rocks at them, we were way too loud for the people who were trying to fish. Oh well we had fun. Then we went to Denny's and the guy who was there was the guy who was our waiter on Thursday morning when we took the seniors out to lunch and he remembered all of our drinks and orders exactly. Well not exactly because he thought I was Angela, but I don't mind because she's beautiful. I didn't get home till 2 and then mom was up and she was talking to us till 3. Craziness. She had a lot of energy for that hour she amazes me.
