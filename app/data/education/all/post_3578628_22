As administrator of Local Cafe, I support Michael Moore and his creation of Fahrenheit 9/11.  I am a growing individual and I am not afraid of the truth.  I believe in spreading it and so far, there has been nothing to tell me that this movie isn't hard fact.  But that's not what this posting is for.  It's so I can tell you that this man is being asked to not air commercials for it because it slams Bush.  Therefore it could not be aired on TV in the 30 days before he is nominated to be running in November.  It would be pulled July 31st if this is enforced on his ad.  Let me say if Dodgeball was pulled, I would find it absurd that it would be pulled and not able to run.  Ads for movies can play as much as the maker wants.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a movie not a campaign ad.
