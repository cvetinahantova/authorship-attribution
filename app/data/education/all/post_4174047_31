Of course this is translated to English, but this is a version of what I and perhaps other Gyopos may go through when communicating with a stranger in Korea.  Scenario: In the store  Me: "Could, I please get two kilograms of Kalbi Sal?"  Korean(shopkeeper) "Pardon me?"  Me: "Could, I please get two kilograms of Kalbi Sal?"  Korean: "Ah yes, of course."  While the shopkeeper is getting the meat, he/she says...  Korean: "Are you Chinese?"  Me: "No, I'm from Canada."  Korean: "But you look Korean?"  Me: "Yes, I'm a gyopo from Canada."  Korean: "Ah, yes...that's great, what are you doing in Korea?"  Me: "Studying Korean and Teaching English."  Korean: "That's great...well enjoy your time in Korea."  Me: " Thanks, Goodbye."   These situations happen because my Korean, although quite decent, does sound different from Koreans. It will always be difficult to have perfect pronunciation. Just as native speakers of English can differentiate a native to a person speaking English as a second language. So, can Koreans...my point is that there is always two sides to a situation. For all you English teachers out there that complain and get frustrated when your students aren't grasping your lessons, try to think of how you feel when your speaking Korean...especially for Gyopos. People can be kind and interested in what you have to say, and in turn you can tell your story while practicing your Korean.
