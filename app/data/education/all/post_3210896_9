Well, at least school is  almost  out. We've got 8 days left with students, and 2 days of end-of-the-year work remaining. I'll be working about 6 days out of this summer. The rest of the summer will be spent with my daughter, cleaning my home, and various youth and children's ministry stuff. I'm looking forward to it, as this is my first summer vacation as a school employee.  Angela will be taking a total of 3 classes this summer as she continues to finish her degree. I should be starting back to school this summer, with night classes. Hopefully, we will be able to balance all of this. People have been asking us if and when we will have another child - my answer? Not any time soon! We've still got to potty train Alyssa. Which is a chore to say the least. More on that later...  Speaking of daughters,  urlLink Jared  has a great  urlLink post about his daughter Macy on his blog . Be sure to check it out.  urlLink Heather  is  urlLink closer than she's ever been to giving birth to her son David .  And finally, speaking of dads and moms, Mother's Day was yesterday, and my mom, my grandmother, my mother in-law, and my wife were all at church together. We had a chance to take some great pictures, and I'll hopefully have those up soon. I wasn't able to give  extraordinary gifts this year, but I've got 364 other days to celebrate the love and joy that these women in my life give to me. I pray that I succeed in returning that joy and love to them not just one day, but every day of the year.
