done did it indeed... talked to amanda just now and asked her about next year...  she wants to live further south because of hospital rotations and driving time, so no problem... i just don't like starting conversations that have the potential to be a little sticky whether they likely will be or not... like a certain someone said last week i think too much about everything... so it goes.  i've had my tv fun tonight... now it's homework time.
