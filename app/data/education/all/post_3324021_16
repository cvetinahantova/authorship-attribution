Yesterday, when I opened my copy of  "The Tower"  I saw a small editorial about the new sports and activities fees that will become effective next school year. I was even more shocked than I already was when I saw that they want all club sports (rowing, sailing, and field hockey) to be included in this fee range. Now, as far as I know, the crew (rowing) team only receives $2000 (two-thousand dollars) from the South budget. Please also note that the crew team does not use the school district's facilities, the only thing that the school's money goes towards is coaching costs, It hasn't effected our club dues one bit. From my latest count, South has 52 rowers. Lets see, what is 52 times the fifty dollars per person the school wants to implement, what's that, $2600 (two-thousand-six-hundred dollars) That would mean that the crew team is paying the school, the school which is supposed to support us, not the other way around. If the crew team is forced to pay under any circumstances other then the school bumping up its support, I will start a movement towards just rowing as DBC all year, because fifty dollars a person is far too expensive to just use the name Grosse Pointe South. Be sure to express your anger towards Superintendent, Suzanne Klein; Asst. Superintendent of Business Affairs, Christian Fenton; Principal, Al Diver; and Asst. Principal of Athletics; Matt Outlaw. Their E-Mail addresses are like all other staff members in the district, firstname.lastname@gpschools.org
