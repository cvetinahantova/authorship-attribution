...............  dreams  ................  this weekend i dreamed that i had made a creamy plum and pomengranate sauce to be served with grilled salmon.   it was amazing.   i've never made a sauce for salmon, nor have i ever made a creamy sauce that included plum or pomengranate.  lynn dreamed that i broke up with her to go out with johanna.  jaelyn never reports her dreams, and the ones she does, i know she makes up because they're too much like the story structure she uses when she tells normal everyday stories.   this morning, though, she promised rather cryptically, that she would reveal her dream from last night at supper.   we sort of ate in shifts around the counter and there was never any "formal" family conversation. now she's asleep.  Drat!  I'm intrigued by the world of children's dreams.
