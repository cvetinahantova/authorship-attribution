Ok, so, everything is so much better now.  I bluffed big time today to Cop, and told him I was moving to the bay area so that his wife can move in and I won't be in their way.  He sat me down and we had a really long talk about everything and we got everything out in the open, and then he was telling me how much he loves me and started crying.  I was like what the...???  I've never seen him cry in the 8 years I've known him, not once.  So he made me promise not to leave and told me that he is going to work on changing some things.  I feel so much better knowing I have my best friend back.  =)
