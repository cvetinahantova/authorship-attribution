Luz, Allen, Jam and I went to the Avilon Zoo in Montalban last Saturday. I was really excited, as I've NEVER been to a zoo before. Thinking that we’d be going on a gimmick later that night and that zoos lie on flat land, I wore high heeled sandals. Those sandals were the most comfortable ones I had; I was really used to wearing them. Apparently, Avilon had a span of 7 hectares -- not a square foot stood on flat land and most of the road had “rough” tiles. Well. Alam nyo na nangyari sa paa ko. Hehe! Nevertheless, I enjoyed looking at and teasing the animals, especially the tiger with sumpong. :)  The one thing that spoiled my Avilon experience (sounds like something from Star Trek) was our tour guide, or should I say, TOR guide. Yeah, she was cute. That was why Allen and Jam insisted on following her in the first place (Luz and I preferred the cute guy). She mispronounced every two words that came out of her mouth… emu as M.U., pavilion as favilyon, and my favorite, habit as habEt. A kid there had to correct her (“habIIIIt!!!”). Our eyes were bulging from our heads because we really had to stop ourselves from laughing. At least we had some entertainment during the tor.  If you guys have the time, drop by the zoo. The place is great. They’re open everyday from 8am-5pm, with guided tours every hour til 3 pm. Each tour takes about 2 hours. Entrance fee is P180 per person. You can call the Avilon office at 9425960, or call Stef at 0917-8995126 for roadmaps. Better yet, call Luz, Allen, Jam or me.  Pabahol -> Luz was the BEST tour guide ever. :)
