For those of you who know anything about me, you should know the "Bill Clinton" orgy going on on the top of my blog pisses me off. There is no way I would buy that doorstop, even to set it on fire! Why do blogs feel the need to slap an add on our sites anyway? And if there really is a need for them, why won't they be bothered to assign them correctly!?!? If nothing else, my site should be hawking George Bush 2004 items or a Reagan book or something. Even Blogspot is hopeless. Argh....
