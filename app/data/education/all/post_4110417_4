(If you didn't get that subject line, you need to go watch "The Two Towers".)  I just got online and looked up calorie values for sushi.  Pieces of regular rolls (California, others with rice on the outside) average 25 calories per piece.  Nigiri sushi (slices on rice) average 60 calories each.  Dragon rolls are 75 calories per piece (ouch).  Amazingly, ramune is only 75 calories per bottle, probably due to the fact that there is more glass than liquid.  Motivation for this calorie search?  Scott and I went to the Pearl Street Mall sidewalk sales in Boulder today, and I discovered just how many tempting restaurants are in that part of town.  I twisted Scott's arm and we had dinner at Hapa, during happy hour when they offer 2 rolls for $2.50 each.  I was really worried about blowing my diet, but it looks like I'm still in my target range.  Even with the fried calamari.  So I guess sushi parties are still okay during my diet!  I just have to avoid the tempura stuff and go easy on the dragon rolls.  And I need to go to the Asian mart for seaweed salad, because it is really yummy, no fat, and very low calories.  Expensive, though.  In other news, I just applied for a chemistry position at Overland High School.  I'm going to bike to the post office tomorrow to mail my resume, and then pedal on to Overland to see how far it is from here.  Chem is always a good place to start, because you get fewer yahoos in the classes, and fewer people apply for the job.  Keep your fingers crossed for me!
