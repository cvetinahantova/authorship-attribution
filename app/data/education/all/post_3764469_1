And I didn't expect it to happen this soon. Only four days after  urlLink Mr. Web Presence himself  announced the presence of Pisay98 blog, 15 members are now part of the blog and there are now six posts. Yes, six post; I know it's small, and maybe the rate of posting is dwarfed by  urlLink nikki's . But the invasion is happening at the back of Pisay98's main blog. Our batchmates are slowly being pulled to the dark side of the blog world. (cue background music:  The Empire  music). Tseri just started her  urlLink sakura mind speaks  (whoops), and Jem may have found another  urlLink place  to put his legendary  WTF List.  Got a blog, and you want to add it to our blog roll? Just email  urlLink me  or  urlLink jaemark . Your blog is on our blog roll, and you want it taken out? do the same!
