The girls team kicked ass today. I got second place and eight points. McPhail was a lap ahead, but she's a great runner so I can't complain.   Ahhh Auditions on Friday. I'm not really worried, because it's just for fun and if we don't make it, I wouldn't be surprised. If we do make it, that's the only time I'd get nervous. But I honestly don't think we'll get that far. It's all good.   Ehhh! Shelb bought be the Punisher Soundtrack Album. Amy Lee and Seether...kick ass! There's some other hot stuff on there too. Nickelback and Trapt...Drowning Pool...awesominity.   I wanted you to know, That I love the way you laugh. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Away...  I keep your photograph, And I know it serves me well. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome And I dont' feel right  When you're gone  Away...  The worst is over now, And we can breathe again. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain Away...  There's so much left to learn, And no one left to fight. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain...  'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome... And I don't feel like I am strong enough. 'Cause I'm broken When I'm lonesome. And I don't feel right When you've gone  Away...
