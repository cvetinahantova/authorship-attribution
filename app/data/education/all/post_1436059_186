Merry Christmas!     Which  urlLink Legendary Actress  are you?  I've updated again.  Where having a cookout today after I go out to drive.   I ran five miles this morning, even though today was going to by my "rest" day. I don't feel comfortable eating all day and not running. I don't know why. A bad habit from three seasons of constant running.  The Smiths (YAY CORYNNE! LoL) and the Pinkhams are coming over, and Brian is coming with the Pinkhams. We are going to barbeque since it's nicer out than it was yesterday. Set off sparklers...YAY!  Well, I don't much like my heading at all, really. I don't have time to change it since I can hear the Smiths already at our door, but I'll change it after our Fourth of July BBQ!
