Well yesterday was a very shitty day, I had to brake it off with my significant other (well tried to) but I couldn't do it because I love him more then anything and I don't want to loose him. I don't know how my life would be without him in it, but I know I don't even want to picture it. Anyways the reason why I was going to was the fact that in the begging og out relationship I had told him I will not lie about my age and yesterday I found out he told his mother I was 19 when I'm not. So I figured if he's that afraid to tell people maybe we should just wait till I'm 18 before we get serious that's it for now thought id let you know about it post more later.
