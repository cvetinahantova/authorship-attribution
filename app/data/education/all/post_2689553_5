Well, I had a pretty rough day on friday. New semester, new classes, whole lotta headaches. It started about, oh, about...4th period. It was government, with Mr. White. I have nothing against him, except for the offensive symbols he chose for his desktop background on his computer, but then again, it was just the Eagles. (I'm still mad at them from botching up their chances at making it to the Superbowl.) And then, he handed out the books we'd be using, and expected us to cover them with the most annoying book covers ever. I torn mine, and had to use a lot of tape. But still, it worked, which is what mattered. Then 5th period was gym. My stupid lock for my locker wasn't open. Took me half the period tryin to get it open. My gym teacher, who looks like Vin Deisel, was pissed. Then I went to the nurses office to take my carafate between gym & 6th period. And they wouldn't let me take it, because it was "too far from lunch", which really is when i'm supposed to take it, but i figured that it wouldn't matter, I could just take it while i was up there. But i couldn't. So i went to 6th period, Mystery & Detective lit, and that was ok, except the teacher was incredibly boring, she got the number of Bond movies wrong, she said there were only 4 Bonds, and she said James Bond has been out for 40 years. Actually, its 42 years. Then I had lunch, which was okay, cept some guy kept bothering me. Finally, it was 8th period, and time for Advanced Computer Applications. I couldn't find the teachers room, and she had a wierd voice which kinda got on my nerves. She's a great person, but her voiced was...eh, well. Thats about it. Gave me a headache the size of Texas, so I hoped into Dave (my red 1990 VW Jetta GL) and went for a drive. That took care of it.
