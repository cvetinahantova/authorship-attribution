I absolutely love not having classes for a few weeks.  I get to come home, spend some time with my wife, eat dinner as a couple, and then the day just flows as it should.  Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoy furthering my education, but I think that after I receive my master’s degree, that will be my final stop on the edutrain.  We are currently dogsitting my sister in law’s dog, which also happens to be a Sheltie, however, her Sheltie is about 1/3 the size of our seven month old dog.  It’s hard to believe that a runt is really that tiny.   Well, unfortunately this writing isn’t too exciting, so I won’t waste any more of my time with it this evening;  just didn’t want to let my fans down =).
