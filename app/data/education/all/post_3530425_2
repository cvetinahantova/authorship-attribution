The difference in men before and after sleeping with them can be amazing.  They go from, "I want you, I'll do or say anything to get you," to "I'll call you baby."  It's like flipping a switch.  After a couple of weeks of daily phone calls and emails declaring how wonderful I am, I finally made the beast with two backs with Juan.  And I haven't heard from him since.  I thought I was a better judge of sincerity, but I obviously need to reexamine my skills, because he fits the description above.  Actually, I could sense the switch the night he was here:  something was just -- I don't know -- different after we finished when he was getting ready to leave.  Something in his demeanor told me that his words were just another line.  The good news is that I'm not neurotic about it.  I don't feel I have to call or email him and seek some sort of conclusive word from him.  I'm just chalking it up to a life lesson on men.  Frankly, I don't have that much experience with dating.  Sleeping with a lot of guys isn't the same.  So, should I make them wait longer to sleep with me, to prolong the relationship?  Or should I sleep with them right away, just to find out if they mean what they say or not?  It's not a question I expect an answer to, but it would be helpful to know others' experiences.  Frankly, I'm more likely to sleep with them right away, to cut my emotional losses.  Well, whatever happens, it's a life lesson.
