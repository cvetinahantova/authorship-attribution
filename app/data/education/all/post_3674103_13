even after living in south korea for almost two years now, the normal notions and tendencies still amaze me. for example, there was a student in my class today who had a sun burn on his face. he had went to a theme park on the holiday and spent a little too much time in the sun walking around. now i can understand how that would be embarrassing for a child. i mean, imagine if that happened to you when you were in elementary school. i'm sure the children would laugh at you at least a little, but that's not the point here.  koreans are very sensitive about their skin. the reason is, well for lack of a better term, they're racist. if you were that child with a sun burn, i highly doubt you would have to listen to the same ridicule as here. comments such as "you are dirty" and "you are black" are the norm. in fact, even if a student of mine gets a normal sun tan (this is not restricted to burns), the students will say they look black and laugh at them.  also, the inter-racial couples are pretty much the same. hiddink (the white soccer coach for the korean national team) was engaged to a black woman, and that was big news here. again, this is not restricted to just famous couples. i've heard many a story about a foreigner and a korean walking down the street together and the passers-by making comments and the like. (however, for some reason a white male and a korean female is not considered very bad because a white male is considered to be rich and therefore a good choice for a korean woman).
