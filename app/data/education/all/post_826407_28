I've been using my computer quite a lot in my personal spiritual life recently, meditating on different Images, prayers and scriptures.  There's something about that I find a lot more accessible than a daily reading booklet.  Maybe it is the interactivity of it all, I dunno, but it works for me.  Anyhow, These are seven simple animations/meditations on the   urlLink .:::rejesus - spirituality - seven sayings:::.  of Jesus as he hung on the cross.  They are very simple but extremely powerful.  The whole  urlLink Rejesus  site is well worth looking at as well.
