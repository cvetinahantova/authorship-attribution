it's official -- i don't care anymore... seriously, i have no problem turning in completely made up answers to my profs, getting horrible grades, and just being done with things.  i've never had so much to do at once as i have had this weekend, and my brain is fried.  i learned lots of stuff this semester, just not quite what my profs wanted me to.  its been a recent revelation that grades are pretty insignificant in general (at least in terms of math grad school).  either you have a tough prof who gives mostly Bs, or an easy prof who gives mostly As.  as long as you turn in stuff, there's not a chance of getting a C because no prof can justify being the one who got you kicked out if you've been turning in your work and going to class and making some sort of an effort.  if i'm going to turn in hours worth of work and most likely get Bs all around anyhow, i might as well not agonize anymore, right?  right.... you know as soon as graph theory's done i'll be panicking over algebra, and after that over analysis... remind me of this entry when i do that.  i'm grumpy, tired, feeling dumb, and who knows what else.... at least i have a bowl of pistachio pudding. =)
