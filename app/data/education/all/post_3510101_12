Okay well it is June 19th, 2004.  And it's about 7:00 in the morning.  I haven't gone to sleep all night, but shhh...don't tell my mommy.  Okay well aside from that, I am bored. And ummm...footsteps.  Okay it was just my mom.  Well I have had a nice week, I bought new shoes, and new charms for my charm braclet, it's not an italian charm one, it's the good old fashion one.  My charm of choice is four buttons hanging on links.  It's a cool bracletand I am still bored. Well by now I am coming to the realization that umm..no one comes to my blog, I am just writing and writing to thin air.  And believe me the air is thin, have you heard of the Greenhouse effect?  Lol. Okay well anywho.  I have had a nice week, I got the new SWITCHFOOT CD!! YAY!! And today I could go to Jasper's Birthday party, or go to DOt's hmmm....choices.  Well the other day, or last night for that matter, I made another website, it's pretty cool. Well I am feeling tired of typing.  I don't think that last sentence made sence, but that's okay cause I am sleep deprived.  Well hope you all have a peachy keen day! ADIOS! Asta pasta, adn leave comments or sign my guestbook on my actual website!  BUBYE!
