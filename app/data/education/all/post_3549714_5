Sometimes it feels as if we spend half of our lives standing in a queue, “waiting”…its hard to wait for anything may it b something or someone!! Standing at the end of a long queue with a waiting status is killing… We all are somehow or the other in a waiting phase…waiting for hard times to end…waiting for another day to start, waiting for the sun to set and give way to a peaceful night. Waiting for all the struggles of life to end, waiting for a better tomorrow…!!! Like the whole world out there I am standing in the same queue since ages, the strange part is that the queue keeps on growing delaying my turn to attain my share of happiness and this time the queue is lined up in front of Gods distribution cell. Theirs a fear that keeps on haunting me, what if when after standing in this wait queue for so long when my turn comes up and I reach the window of God’s distribution cell of “happiness”…….what if I find a label there “ store out of stock – CLOSED!!!”    Plz God!!  Don’t do this to me!!!
