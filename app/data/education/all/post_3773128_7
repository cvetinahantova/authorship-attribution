We had a birthday party in the lecture hall just now for those who's birthday is in the month of July. The party came as a surprise for all of us, because none of us knew about it. Our lecturers were the ones who planed it.  The party reminds me of all the Birthday Bash I had in my youth group back home. However, during the Birthday Bash we had fun and everyone would be laughing and enjoying themselves.  Yet I could sense that a lot of us had a sad feeling during the party this afternoon.  Maybe it's because of Q1's story: when he came to study in Malaysia, he had to celebrate his birthday alone. None of his friends in Korea remembered his birthday.  I guess it'll be the first time for most of us to celebrate our birthday without our families :(      Tried my hand on tennis. It's actually quite fun.    I figure that since I have to learn a language from the beginning and rely on it to survive, i might as well learn a few more stuff, right from the beginning.
