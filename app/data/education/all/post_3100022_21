I will turn your attention to the first section where I took the nicety of sitting behind an exit door for granted. Our second league was not as convenient, not being so horizontally challenged as most; getting good quality shuteye on the thirteen and a half hour flight to Heathrow was difficult and not at all pleasant. However exhaustion and ultimately free alcohol got the better of my sunny disposition and soon I was off to the land of nod, and surprisingly had some good REM time. In total I think Rachelle and I got no more than three hours between the two of us for 36 hours of being awake. (Aaron got the most at one stage he was fast asleep and I needed to make a visit to the bathroom.  I tried for at least 5 minutes to wake him up and of course I couldn't so I called for the stewardess and asked if I could climb over Aaron. Sure not a problem was the answer and she helped me do so (a special note just picture airline seats made for midgets and the near physical impossibility for any normal sized person to sit in comfortably, little own perform amazing feats of contortionism. Oh if only I had been awake to see the fun. - Aaron.)  I even had to climb back, still not a stir from sleeping beauty. ) So as you could imagine as I write this I don't yet think the exciting reality of this experience has surpassed the surreal dreamlike zombie state that we are both in. It's truly amazing how funny the most mundane things become when you are deprived of sleep. I had a dream that I had superpowers if I wore in my favorite underpants on my head.
