wow today was a long day. first off, last night I stayed up until 3am hanging out with my brother's friend paul. and we made him a xanga  urlLink http://xanga.com/paulisqueer   he is obsesed with the word gay so the whole thing is a joke but anyways... ok so today I didn't go to school...I called in sick and my techer hopefully believed me. So I did some schoolwork off and on until about 3. Then I was washing cars with my brother and paul...we washed my grandpa's car, my neighbors suv, my other neighbor's van, and we were going to wash matthews(one of the twins) truck but I had to get ready for ballet. um that's pretty much it. I started making another ballet layout but it's not finished yet oh and I am so mad because I can't download songs to a disc on my computer because we don't have all of the software set up. yeah so that means I am going to have to buy a bunch of cds or just listen to them on the computer...bye!
