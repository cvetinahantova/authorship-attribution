Hello Ladies!  I meant to get on here yesterday, but my computer at home is having problems connecting with the internet.  I just want to let everyone know that I am A-OK!  After spending a couple hours at Urgent Care yesterday, I left with 7 stitches on my chin.  The good news is, I can start running again in a couple days.  It has been a rough start, I had shin splints and then this (bad things don't ALWAYS have to come in three, do they?), but I am not going to let it discourage me.  I have a couple extra special thanks to give out... to the lovely ladies that were running with me during my unfortunate spill... you are awesome!  When you ran by after you had run the hill and shouted out "We ran it for you!" you managed to put a smile on my face (which at that time was almost impossible to do!)  You are my inspiration to get back out there and keep running!  Mary Kay... Thank you for helping me yesterday and keeping calm. I really needed that.  I have never had stitches, broken any bones or even remember getting stung by a bee!  This could have been a really tramatic experience for me, but your relaxed state helped me calm down and not panic.  You are a born leader!  The doctor said I can probably get my stitches out on Friday, so by our next run on Sunday, I should be 100% again.  Thank you again for all your love and support.... I hope you all have a fabulous week!  Jessica
