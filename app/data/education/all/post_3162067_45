Chihuahua! For some insane reason this stupid song from the Ministry of Mayhem is trapped in my head. Me and Si keep texting it to each other...because right now, I really need to jazz up my phone bill! Jees my feet smell bad. If only I could take them off and put them through the washing machine. First (proper) day of the holidays.Â  I've been to the dentist to get my two fillings replaced (which didn't hurt at all, although now my mouth feels very crowded. I've been living with two gigantic cavities for too long) and now I'm sitting glaring at my mobile, willing Jayne to ring and tell me if I got that job or not. I'm so nervous. I really want this job and the longer I go without hearing anything the more I feel that the news is not good. Knowing my luck Jayne's off sick today. I'm finding it very difficult to motivate myself to do anything until I know. It's kinda like savouring that last moment of relaxation: if I get the job I'm going to have to immediately start a wild flat hunt and if I don't I'm going to have to resume my wild job hunt. Ring, dammit, RING!!!!!! Oh and Haru, if you're reading this, I've lost your email address: please email me :)
