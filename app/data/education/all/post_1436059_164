Yes, my friends. In nine days I will reach the mature age of fifteen. (Bloodstained Eleanor opens on my BIRTHDAY!! Whoot!)  *snickers*  I've only asked for a few presents of my parents. Probably because I really don't want much. A new CD player since mine is old and stopped working last week. A new pair of shoes just because mine are getting worn and the shoelaces have frayed and the laces won't lace. Other than that, everything is up to my family's discression.   This weekend Amanda and I are going to go see The Day After Tomorrow with my father (though not necessarily *with* him). My gore-scared Aunt is coming into town this Saturday from Minneapolis, and is going with her sister (mum) to see Shrek 2. I've already seen it, and I really want to see TDAT with Amanda. So, yeah...our plans are set.  The closer my birthday gets, the more I realize that I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don't know if I'd ever be able to write professionally. Going into the Naval Academy is at least an eight-year commitment. Music is lovely, and I could do it for my whole life, but in a world where nobody says what they mean everything I like could be lost on the ears of today's objectional population. I don't want to be stuck in a job that I hate, no matter how much it pays and no matter how cliche that sounds. I want a job that I would not mind getting up for every single day of my life.   I am small and the world is big...  But I'm not afraid of anything.   The HSA's kind of suck. They're easy as any test could be, but when you have to sit quietly without anything to do or read and not allowed to sleep for three hours, it gets to you after four days of it.  Track went well. I had enough points to get three or four letters, which is all well and good since I worked my ass off for it.  I feel fine.  In any case, I will get back to this when I am less confused.
