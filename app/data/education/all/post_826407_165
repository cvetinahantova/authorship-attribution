Helen and I are leading a team of TTs/Formees on Mission to Rome in 2 weeks (tough one I know).  We will be hooking up with Marco and Cinzia and spending a week supporting them and helping out.  As neither us or our team have the money to pay for this trip we decided to raise as much of it as possible through a sponsored silence.  Helen and the TTs will be keeping quiet from Sun Up to Sun down (or thereabouts) this Tuesday.  I Shall not; silence and teaching do not really mix.  If you know us and would like to sponsor Helen then please get in touch.  Thank you.
