I think my curse in life is the play mediator and try and make everyone happy. It is a constant battle I face and it times it is too much for me to take and I wig out. I hate people to be mad at me or unhappy so I am often compromising or just giving up. Often I have nothing to do with the situation at all yet try and bring people to a compromise.  Some say a gift I say I am cursed. I can't believe I ever worked in staffing cause talk about playing mediator. No wonder I hated that job.  I always give in and always let the other one win cause it just takes too much time and energy to fight.  I have been doing it all my life. The oldest child of divorced parents will do that do you.  I always was having to deliver messages to the other side or defend the others actions in their absence. That is a lot of mental work for a ten year old. Now my parents live about 40 minutes apart from one another and when I go home I spend the time trying to see everyone and making sure everyone gets and equal share or I never hear the end of it.  It is no wonder I avoid going home.  I feel like I could use my powers to at least make more money.  Like a labor negotiator or peace talks in the Middle East.
