it's amazing how much power a nice mug of hot drink has.  be it mocha, espresso, plain black coffee, cappuccino, cocoa, cider, tea, you name it.  (1) hot drinks are wonderfully yummy cups of happiness... i've never met a hot drink i didn't like, or that i couldn't modify with milk and/or sugar so that i did.  (2) hot drinks are generally so full of sugar and/or caffeine they give you the energy you're lacking just when you need it, and that's great, but even better...  (3) hot drinks are a source of security. i've slept 15 hours of the past 96 (less than 4 hours per night for the last 4 nights), and the next two nights aren't looking much better.  i have so much homework to do before the semester ends that i don't know if it's humanly possible to finish it all if i were able to go without sleep and not be running on caffeine for the week, and my semester ends with a final for a class that i'm pretty sure i have one of the lowest 2 or 3 grades in for the term to date, and it's all a bit overwhelming, but i find it absolutely amazing that i can get home exhausted, having been in class and/or doing homework pretty much for the last 14 hours straight, ready to collapse, but 10 minutes later with a large fresh mug full of hot honey vanilla apple cider, it's all ok, and i'm good to go again.  ah, the power of hot drinks  the end. =)
