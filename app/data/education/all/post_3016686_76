urlLink      (the title of this post is a quote about kd lang. Can you guess who said it, in a moment of cleverness?)    kd lang  is about to release her new CD called   Hymns Of The 49th Parallel   on July 27th. It's a covers album of songs by Canadian songwriters, including Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen and Ron Sexsmith (who is still in his prime).  You can already sample her brilliant cover of Neil Young's "Helpless" on itunes (or just get  urlLink snippets of a few songs  on Amazon). I played it over and over yesterday.    I don't have a recent picture of kd, but the last time I saw her I realized that  urlLink Clay Aiken  has sort of stolen her look!
