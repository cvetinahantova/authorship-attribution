[experiencing technical difficulties]  Or, at least I was.  If you've wondered why posts have been lacking lately, it is because I finally chucked my Microsoft CD's out the window.  I am operating on a "brand new" computer:  the same hardware now running  urlLink Fedora Core 2  (formerly Red Hat Linux)  I don't have everything up and running yet (DVD video, TV tuner, some other things aren't configured yet) but I was pleasently suprised just how much worked "out of the box" (iPod, SATA RAID, dual head monitor/dual video cards, etc).  It is looking good and running notably faster than under XP.  Anyhow, I am up and running again.
