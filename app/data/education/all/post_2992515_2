I'm not surprised. Who would be?  Very  predictably, my little summer schedule thingy has failed again. And I had even revised it. But just for the benefit of anyone (me?) who may want to contemplate its impossibility (?), I'll put it here...Who knows? Miracles do happen, and tomorrow I may end up writing here that I actually went according to plan.   6-7..............Study Physics 7-7:30...........Revise Almas's story 7:30-8:30........Write letters/post on my forums 8:30-9:30........Study Bio 9:30-10:30.......Break  10:30-11:30......Paint/Write the articles 11:30-12.........Revise Br. Elias's book 12-1.............Blog  Anyway. Nothing much is up. Yesterday, I went out the second time since we've been here, and it wasn't even worth it. My mom loves shopping, especially for clothes, so I lured my parents out to this clothes center...because it was behind one of the biggest bookstores in Jeddah. (See, my parents have this passionate dislike for my reading obsession.) I'd planned to beg my way into the bookstore if I got the chance, but by the time we came out of the clothes place, it was past closing time. I guess my dad felt sorry for me, so he said we could go today. I just hope the  Bourne Ultimatum  is on a clearance sale or something.   Right now, my little cousin is annoying me. She just wants to play house, house, and more house. Blergh. It wouldn't have been that bad if we hadn't played house every day for the last 10 days or something. And yeah, that's why I plan to begin my day 6 in the morning, so that I'm free by the time she comes over. (She lives next door.) Problem is, my mom makes me go back to sleep after Fajr, so it's  kind  of hard to live up to my schedule.    I've been thinking about things, and I really want to write it down, but the mood passes before I can find an opportunity sit on the comp. So hah.   Have to get ready for Maghrib now.  Peace.
