I am trying a scary thing for me, I am trying to completely be off my anti-depressant drug. The last month or so I have been feeling foggy and having headaches feeling weird so when I was house sitting I brought enough medicine for seven days but I was there nine. The last two days I didn't use my medication and guess what? My head isn't foggy and I don't have headaches, the best thing was that I slept all night without my drugs! So I asked my dad what I should do because if it's wrong to go cold turkey I don't want to do something that's stupid. I've been on Remeron for ever it seems like, two to three years I think. I asked my psychiatrist once if I could gradually wean myself off and she got upset saying that I have had three major depression episodes and that it would be likely to have another. She was like if you want to get off of them just do it, don't wean yourself off. I was thinking don't get an attitude I just want to know what my options are! I am scared because I know how to handle my emotions properly now but I hope that I can, and I am scared that I will go through a withdrawal. So my dad says to see how it goes for the next week and go from there.  Lord I pray that you will be the owner of my emotions, I pray that you will be my strength, help me through my fears. I am so excited and nervous because I have wanted for a long time to get off this drug. I pray that you will take hold of the depression and make it not be an issue anymore. I believe that with your help we can get through this together so please take my hand and guide me. Thanks.
