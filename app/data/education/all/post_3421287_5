Hey.  Finally, I get around to having my own blog.  These things take me a while.  From thought to action...eventually.  That's me.  Lets see how long I keep this up.  Today I feel rough.  I may have given myself food-poisoning. Tomorrow I have to be up at 5am, to see someone off at the airport.  I should sleep now, but I wont.  I'll hang around on here for a while, and watch some tv and read some mags, and then I'll drift off to sleep and I'll get 2 hours sleep and in the morning I'll look like shit.    I don't like sleep.  I always feel like I'm missing something.  Sleep is what I do when I want to get away, when it all gets too much, so to do it on a regular day seems wrong.  But until they figure out a way for me to do without sleep, I'll do it my way, and I'll look like shit.  So what.
