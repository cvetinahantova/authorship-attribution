What program are you on?   I am doing not a whole lotta anything right now.. hense this web community.   What do you want from coming here?  I would like to try and be better motivated.. and be held accountable. It really helps me to be motivated...   What works? How has it worked?  Weight Watchers works for me (when I am being good). I am not fully in it right now, but want to be.  Okay... that is it for introductions.
