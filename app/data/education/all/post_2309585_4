urlLink          Another Christmas come and gone. I'll miss it. I love having an excuse to buy presents for people. I love surprising people. And Andy seemed plenty surprised by the Martin Backpacker guitar I got him (since his mom said he's been talking about getting one since he was 16). My parents surprised me with an AWESOME digital camera! Yay! I don't have to borrow their old, outdated one anymore! :)  All in all, things are great! I was all smiles when I went to bed on December 25th.  But, for every up, there's a down. Andy decided a couple of months ago we couldn't make it to Walt Disney World for our annual New Years' trip, since he'd used up almost all of his vacation time. So, I decided not to go without him, because a) it wouldn't be as fun without him, and b) who would take care of him, the house, the dog, etc? Besides, it'll mean a little more time together before I go back to school full-time.  And then he and his band got booked to play New Years' Eve. And they're practicing during all of Andy's free time. So, I'll most likely be sitting at home by myself when midnight strikes. I get the feeling that the band doesn't really like me to be around-- sort of a Yoko Ono kind of thing. Looks like it's just me and the dogs (my Luna and mom & dad's Diva) that night.  Then, THEN, the night before my family leaves for WCW, he mentions that I should have gone with them, that he'd be fine on his own. Well, too late now, now that I've gone ahead and scheduled doctors' appointments, let prescriptions run out, put off paperwork, and didn't get any money out of the bank. Oh well.  So, I'm bummed. I'm happy in the grand scheme of things, but I'm super-bummed. But the puppies like me. :)
