Was sad all day today. Last night I asked Craig if he would mind if I attended Rick's memorial service today. Craig said that was fine, that he was not the jealous type. But this morning he told me that he thought I shouldn't go, that I should focus on the living (Wendy, Shelby, and the foreign exchange student) and not the dead. And that six years had already gone by, meaning this was in the distant past. (To me, it was like yesterday)   I knew that Craig was right, so I made plans to take the girls shopping down in San Diego. But all day I was filled with an unexpected deep sadness, and memories of things Rick and I had done together. We were only together on and off for three years, and most of it was tumultuous, but we had a deep bond. I don't know why I loved him, I just did. And I really can't believe he is gone. It's like someone made a mistake, whether it was God or karma or whatever.   I tried calling the coroner's office to find out why he died, but the woman who answered the phone didn't understand the lab report, so she told me to call back tomorrow and talk to the doctor.
