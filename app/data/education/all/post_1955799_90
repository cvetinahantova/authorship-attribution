My life as a Graphic Designer  How many goals are there in life?  How can one flourish or fail?  I'm thinking of adding some additional skills to my roster.  True to form, I'm paninking about how I can fit all of the things I want to fit into my schedule.  I know, however that if I allow myself to think about my ideas over a week or two, a solution will emerge.    It's funny, but moment I wrote about my crisis, the panic faded away.  Life is good.
