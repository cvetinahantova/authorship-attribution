- rain & mortality -    its rainy today in canton.   abby & noah were at our house to play -- two two year olds and two four year olds -- means that you *don't* want a rainy day.   so when i got there, lynn had built the biggest friggin tent EVER out of chairs, couches, afghans, quilts.  it right near filled the whole livin' room.  multiple rooms. hallways. ahhh! nostalgic joy that came from building such tents.   with the humidity recurred a rattle in my trachea.  i had the same rattle (with deep breaths) through much of the month of june (rainy season).  But i never put it together with the rain until today.  using the spiritual-gift-of-worrying that i've started to learn from Lynn -- i just assumed it was the latent asbestosis that i've been waiting to kill me.  it's supposed to have a latency period of about 17 years.  I guess I should have about two more years before it kicks in (of COURSE i'm jesting -- i have no intention of dying that soon).   but it is remarkable what can stimulate thoughts of your own mortality.   and it is remarkable to think that 17 years have almost passed since I was 18 years old.    dazed and ancient, i bid you:   peace~
