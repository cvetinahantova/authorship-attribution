Hey! I'm having a slow day today...It's all good because I haven't had anything bad happen, yet... But anyways, so far so good. We have a Sub. Today in school but I guess that's okay because he mostly stays in front of the classroom...I think. Anyways, I forgot what happened yesterday so after I post this I have to go look.  I miss my freedom, I mean I have freedom, its just that when I am at home I don't get a whole lot of space to enjoy my life and just relax, you know? I mean we have kids running around, people always coming over with more kids, and I never get a special place all to myself. I mean I can walk around town, but everyone knows me or someone in my family and they want to talk. I just cant be by myself! I guess its all good, but it would be nice if I got a little alone time. (On the same subject) I never get any time with my boyfriend either! There is always someone sitting and watching us like what we do is a new motion picture! I don't understand why people can't give us a little time to ourselves. But I do understand, on the other hand, I understand that my parents might not trust my boyfriend and me together yet, and that they just might want to get into my life a little bit since I always push them away.  Anyways I got to go because the teacher is coming. Bye!
