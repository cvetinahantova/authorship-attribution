Okay, I’ve done my bitching...everything is fine. I’ve formatted the “Minima Black” blog template to approximate the color scheme of my site, and in fact, I think I will be changing my site to incorporate some of the new things here. Particularly, the goldenrod-colored titles. If only I could get Dreamweaver to sync with my UW web account, I'd really be fancy schmancy.
