I have ballet class at 6:30 tonight, then rehearsal until 10. Ick last night I had rehearsal from 8-10:30, then we talked about the company and other happenings until 11:15. I was so tired but when I got home, I watched the Cosby Show marathon until 1 so that wasn't very good My first performance with LaDiego will be at CDF on Sunday, August 22nd at 9:00pm. I think it will be an okay performance. Oh and I get to see sdcyb, Christy's company, and Phil's company perform, as well as some shot companies(cough cough cal bal cough cough). Ewww! I hope that the lady in white isn't there (Charlene Penner). She is so gross and scary to watch!  _/*\_ ¸.·¤**¤·.¸.·¤**¤· \* */       ~liana  /·*·\¸.·¤**¤·.¸¸.·¤**¤·
