Work: Finished Ch. 1 of TGoP.  Wrote the first page of Ch. 2 Wrote approx. 4 pages of diss. Comments: Well, I worked well, but I didn't do much else.  Today was BORING.  I didn't get dressed, I didn't go outside, heck, I only saw one other human being (briefly).  I did get work done, though.  Once again, I did a lot of modding at TDD (no banning, sadly), and I read some of the Dukies' old stuff.  Reading their stuff is great.  I remember everything about those games--the hype, the stupid stories, the idiotic quotes, the bad calls, and it all comes back so vividly when reading their articles.  They bring back the days when I was a Triangle insider--I appreciate the jokes on so many levels, because you really had to be there to "get it."  I'm so sad that I'm not there right now.  I was thinking about '01, and that happy day in March when Cassie and I got back into her car after a lovely dinner at Outback, with the North Carolina sun still shining, and the first thing we heard when we turned on the radio was Woody Durham lamenting the Heels' loss to Penn St.  I had spent the earlier part of that weekend in Greensboro watching Duke win two NCAA games, and this was just the topper to the whole weekend.  It was one of those little moments that you cannot have unless you live in a place--really live in it.  It cannot be recreated; nothing that I love about RTP can be recreated.  That is why it is so disappointing to visit.  I try to put myself in the same situations and places that yielded those great moments, and they are always disappointing.  Life cannot be forced--and what I experienced in those two years was the beauty of living life, amplified by a place I loved and good people.  It was the beautiful irregularity of normal, day-to-day life in RTP that captured my heart, and I won't rediscover that until I live there again.
