Well, the birthday party was a success! I had a great time, but i did end up getting some very weird presents.. such as threee pairs of socks and a chicken soup for the teenager's soul board game. The guys were also cheap, (well the one's that actually gave me a present) they all apparently decided to give me ten dollors. Which is generous but i would rather fifteen or twenty. And for father's day i gave Jack breakfest in bed and then all of these really sweet presents, and his stupid kids didn't even give him a card or present.. which i thought was really stupid and i was pissed.. because it is Jack's day and his kids wont even let him have a good day! So, now this week i have to get my tonsols and addnoids out ( i have no idea how to spell those two) and then i am going to get a tooth pulled and find time to go to my cousins in between. So i have a busy summer that's starting!
