What I am doing is typing with one hand to a couple friends.  And typing here, well today is June 2nd.  And well I am eating.  I am very bored, and the news just ain't that riveting tonight.  Well let's see what happened today?  Uhhhh.....O I know!!! zzzzzzzzi got my yearbook!!! Go CUHS!!! As of tomorrow @ 1:45 (or whenever the bell rings) I Alisha, will be a Sophomore!!!!  Really really sad that school is over wonder if everyone can just come back tomorrow just for me?!? Well guess we'll never know.  Well I am now a two handed-betty now.  And I would just like to say to all the SENIORS who go to my BLOG, "You made it!!! Hopefully.  I will tell all seniors everywhere exactly what I told my friend.  "It's your last day as a senior, so what's a man to do?  Start your life dough-head! That's what.  Well just wanted to congradulate you and hope you start your life with someone fun."  Well for girls, you may need to tweak it, but everyone gets it.  Right?  Okay well I would just like to say that I am truly going to miss all the senior that I know that are leaving.  Hope your life is as wonderful as graduation day, cause that's the best day of your life!  Well sort of.  Besides your wedding day, and birth of your first child, and stuff like that.  But in school days ways, that's the big one.  You'll more then likely cut off contact with your "friends" and that'll be a good thing in the sense that you can meet tons of new people.  Well I promised Dot I wouldn't write anymore novels, so well that's it for now.  BUBYE.   P.S. Cheese is not good with peanut butter cookies.   Adios!
