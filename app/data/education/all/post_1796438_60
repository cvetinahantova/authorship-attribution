Where the hell does it all come from?  What is with it? I mean, no matter where you go there is always the latest craze hanging over your head. For example, "meh", a monosyllabic word giving the indication of "Oh well". And also "My bad". What moron came up with that. Sure it was your fault but the world doesn't have to know. Anyway, I've had my whinge for the day, come back tomorrow for "OMG! What the-" starring ME!  (no quote, don't feel like it)
