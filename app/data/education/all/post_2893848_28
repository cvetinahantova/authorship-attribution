I don't suppose anyone's been following  urlLink this  story, by any chance?  Or  urlLink this ?  The story concerns one of our own, who gave up his literary aspirations in order to get filthy fucking rich, on the backs of thousands of elderly pensioners and mutual fund investors.  Sounds good, no?  I'm thinking the new workshop library should be expanded to include a jacuzzi.  Oh, and our friend the Hurricane should ask for a raise.    Hope all is well with everyone.  Sorry I haven't posted more.  I'll invoke my all-purpose excuse: wedding planning.  Other than that, I've just been kickin' it here in the IC, making desserts, making up for lost time with Nicki, getting my ankle horribly sprained by Alistair Moock, and reading, little by little, Grant's exhaustive history of Canadian electoral politics.
