Dedicated to: SMR   This cold, grey place I call our home but the way things appear, it's where the demons roam I want nothing more than a warm beam of sun but then evil strikes and I'm on the run.  This cold, grey place where I dwell where I am, I look around, I am in hell the illusion of life straightening out lasts only a moment  the the straight life I want becomes suddenly bent.  This cold, grey place eats at me deep within I'm going straight downhill all over again am I this weak, or is it that strong no matter what I do it always seems wrong.  This cold, grey place takes it all away it hurts so bad, so why do I stay it's slowly devouring all of my sanity all I want is to be free.
