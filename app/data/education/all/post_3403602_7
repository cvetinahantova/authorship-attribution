Yeah life is annoying. Im not Emo but Im really hurt evryday. Somwtimes I think know one cares anymore. Ugh...But yeah. I hate life but I wish it would get better. Anyways I was watching this show called Degrassi. Its a show about normal kids living life. Its soo kool to watch. Anyways this one episode I was watching, it was about this grrrl against the skool's food. Saying that it was serving bad food. She starts to have a protest against it like 10 yards from the skool. And then later on in the episode the Princial comes telling her to stop the protest. She told him that she has the right to speak her mind. And then he gave her a weeks detention. Later on she does it again, but this time for another reason. She did it again because she was saying that she has the right to speak her mind. And then the Princial comes warning her to stop. He gave her a choice: either apoligize to the whole skool for the "mess" she made or get kick out of the skool. So she went up to the skool and didnt say soory but she told them that she has the right to speak her mind. It was the freedom of speech and if she would get kick out of the skool so then be it. Then in the end she didnt get kick out. But she was warned not to do it again. But I thought that episode was great. Hopefully you can all see it. Its on this channel called The-N. Its kool. Well thats today. Bye! XoxO
