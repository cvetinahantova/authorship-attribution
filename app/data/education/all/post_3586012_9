Hmm... Today was a fruitful day for me. I went out with my godsis, Doreen. Haiz... Weather so hot yet she asked me go Clarke Quay with her... But, nevermind... At least I got to enjoy myself... Hahaz =)... Went to the arcade with her then play till very de hiong (Not as hiong as that time we played at Plaza Singapura though...) Then after Clarke Quay, I went to Bukit Merah Library with my dearest  dear dear ... Hmm... Stayed at the library till abt 4.45pm like that then decided to go Causeway Point, since my  dear dear  say he dun wanna go Tiong Bahru Plaza (oso dunno why...) Took 961 with my  dear dear  all the way to Woodlands wor... Hehez... Damn long sia... I ended up sleeping... When I woke up, saw my  dear dear  smiling at me... Oso dunno why he always smile at me... Nevertheless, I still like his forever cheerful smile... Hehez... Luv ya  dear dear ... Mua..................ckz! Oh ya, I almost forgot... Dear dear, juz wanna tell u that I'm not as gullible as u think. So, dun worry too much okie? =)
