I didnt post anything pala yeterday... wet on a meeting in Rockwell kasi then we watched Spiderman 2 with Kuya Chino, Perry and Myk. Sobrang depressing naman buhay ni Spiderman dun...:)  It's raining again. Had lunch at Italianni's with Chard. Absent si Kuya Chin eh. Yummy!!  I wont be able to post until Sunday coz I'll be in Batangas...
