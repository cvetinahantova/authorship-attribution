It's news to me!! From the  urlLink Record Collection  website:   John Frusciante recordings will now be coming out on the Record Collection label. There are six releases scheduled at this time, all expected to be out before the years end. The first of these is called  urlLink The Will to Death . It will be in stores June 22nd and will be under his own name... John has been recording one full length album every month this year and would like to release them about that often.     Question: Will this be as good as "Shadows Collide with People" or will it be unlistenable gobbledygook? (see first week of this blog)
