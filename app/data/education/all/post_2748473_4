As i grow older and life changes, I struggle with a concept that I was presented with years ago. Is life as we see it and life how it actually is, two totally different things? Will reality or does reality coincide with how life is or is life all in our perception of it and it changes as we grow older and we change as our perception of what we know to be reality changes?   (You know who you are if this is to you). Right now, I want to forget you and everything and just start from scratch and no matter how much I want to, I can't do it. Give me time, hopefully I will come around sometime.
