Ken Baer has a nice piece in the  urlLink American Prospect  that cites my  urlLink work  on the Red vs. Blue divide.  He makes what I think is an important point about Kerry's selection of Edwards:   The brilliance of the Edwards selection is not that he will enable Kerry to win states in the South (short of a landslide, they are still completely out of reach), but that he will help Kerry remain competitive in “Southern” areas of non-Southern states. While huge turnouts in Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee are critical, Kerry can’t win their respective states without also racking up votes in downstate Illinois, western and central Ohio, central Pennsylvania, and non-urban Wisconsin. It’s in these areas that a Southerner’s drawl, humble roots, and regular church attendance can make a difference.
