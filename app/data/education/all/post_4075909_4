Peter, Paul and Mary were awesome! They sang and I clapped. They cheered out in protest and I screamed. Then I went home and noticed there was something wrong with my foot. It seemed not all right. Bruised even. I stuck it out and went on with my daily life. Well, turns out that was wrong because I have a sprain. Yes, a sprain from a chair. Thank you Westbury Music Fair! In my week of lying like a loaf of bread, I saw the governor of New Jersey step down because he does not want the media rumor attention of being GAY run all over his office. I say not true, something happened..blackmail I think and will stick with. While listening to this, I went to get my father his pills at CVS with my limp and what did I find out? The insurance company he deals with will not approve his pills because they think he could take something else. These people are not doctors, they just want to keep down costs. Last time I looked a representative is not a doctor. A doctor isn't even a doctor anymore. But, it all has to do with the chemicals in the brain and one person will react to one med and not the other. Right? That's what one learns in high school biology. President Bush, are you paying attention here? I think I'll go across the border to Canada when my foot heals? Who is with me?!
