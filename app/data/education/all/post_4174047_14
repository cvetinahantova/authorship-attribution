urlLink    Nothing more I like better than coming home and lounging on the couch or on the computer. This is especially true after a shitty day at work where it seems every brat is pissing you off...I had one of those days today, makes me want to go back to teaching adults, excpet for the split shifts that are required, which makes your day start at 6am, no thanks.
