As you probably can imagine, the next few weeks are full of farewell parties.  Just to give you some idea of what to expect in the weeks to come, here is a bit of an overview.       Wednesday June 30th - Shiogama Boys English teacher enkai at Blair Marina in Shiogama       Saturday - Sunday July 3rd-4th - Oshima Island off the northern coast of Miyagi for the ALT leavers party.       Wednesday July 7th - Shiogama Boys full staff farewell party at the Kirin Beer Port.       Saturday July 10th - Teizan farewell party.       Sunday July 11th - going to Zao (famous mountain in Miyagi) with Yuko and Nitanai-Sensei as a last outing of sorts.  And of course there will be random dinners with friends and other things to fill all the days in between.  It is going to be a costly but fun last few weeks in Japan!
