I woke up this morning and heard the birds singing. Lots of them. Some that I've never heard before. I didn't hear any cars, trucks or motorcycles. It gave me the distinct impression that my house had somehow been teleported into the woods....or the country....some sort of open space.  Of course that didn't last long for I soon heard cars from the highway, dogs barking (that were not my own) and the neighbors yeslling at their kids. *sigh* Oh well. It was nice while it lasted.
