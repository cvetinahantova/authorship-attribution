alright quick and important prayer request.  amanda got a call this morning and she has an interview for a teaching position at a middle school here in whitier today at 2pm. so please please pray that her interview would go well and that the position would be hers if it's the right place for her to be. a full time job for her in the fall is exactly what she has been wanting and what we need as a couple looking at marriage coming up here in september. pray warriors unite!
