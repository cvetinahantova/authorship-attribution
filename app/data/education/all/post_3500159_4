Last night the metro area was hit by huge storms and we were without power for about 3 hours.  It got pretty creepy, just me, the kids, the dog and a bunch of candles burning.  They say it is headed our way again right now.  It made me realize that we depend on electricity and our TV's, Computers, etc. WAY too much!  My kids and I sat there in the dark and didn't quite know what to do......sad, huh?    We are supposed to be heading up to Tulsa tonight, but will have to wait until we see what the weather is going to do.   I hate this...I am ready to get on with my vacation and head north where it is cool!
