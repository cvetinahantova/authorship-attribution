Insomnia is both a very bad film featuring Hilary Swank, Robin Williams (against type) and Al Pacino.  It's also something I have been suffering from of late.  7am the other night.  Laying in bed for 5 hours with nothing but my own hyperactive brain to keep me company.  Thank god I don't have to get up for work at 8  againthese days.  I've tried reading, but that just doesn't help.  Guess the not drinking and not going to bed pissed is having its impact.  Think the answer is to start working overnight.  Sunrises are always better than sunsets.
