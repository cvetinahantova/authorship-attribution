Another Project!    Â  So I'm done teaching and am done with school for at least a month. I figured that to keep myself busy I should start a new project. So I went out and bought a pattern and am now on my way to sewing an awesome Brown Coat! I got the cloth for it for very cheap, it was on clearance, wopee! I sewed quite a bit of it yesterday, and then sewed some today, and realized I had to get some interfacing and stuff. So I was back at the fabric store buying the interfacing. Got that part done, now I only need to attach the collar and the arms to the coat..and volaa (sp!) a new great coat made solely by me!!! Mmm...only problem is that I decided to make the coat a bit lose so I chose the pattern for two sizes bigger than mine..now it's HUGE! :( I now sit redoing a lot of what I would have never had to do, if I had only chosen the right sizE!
