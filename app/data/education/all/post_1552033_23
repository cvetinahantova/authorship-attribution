urlLink The Falling Man    Click on it.  Read it.  And always remember that reality is both horrifying and beautiful.  History is not only what we read in books.  History is what we create with every decision we make.  We live in the midst of chaos.  This chaos is disordered, confusing, frightening, and sometimes enlightening.  In order to live our lives to the fullest we must not run from the chaos that surrounds us, we must instead embrace it.  Instead of struggling to control this chaos, we must learn to ride it out, regardless of how we feel about the place it carries us.  Most people in the "civilized" world spend their lives running from the things they fear.  This is, of course, a perfectly natural reaction and has insured the survival of the human species in many situations.  However, one of the chief differences between humans and other animals is that we have the ability to turn and face the things we fear.  We can choose to stand and fight, or even to stand, observe, and learn.  Some primates will turn and fight for a moment or two, but only humans have the capacity to face their worst nightmares and learn from them.  The lessons learned then become the basis for new decisions, decisions which alter our actions the next time we encounter the same nightmare.  Every decision you make changes the world around you.  Are you making it a better place?  Better for who?
