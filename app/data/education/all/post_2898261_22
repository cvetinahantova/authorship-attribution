Listening to: The reason - Hoobastank Mood: Down    I took the rest of the day off work.  I felt the need to be by myself for a while, take all the things in that have happened, and all the things that I’ve been told over the past few days.  My head feels like a concrete block filled with thoughts, anger, confusion, fear, and melancholy.  I feel  angry  because I didn’t speak about what I wanted to, I feel  frustrated  because I allowed somebody insignificant talk to me in a disrespectful manner, I feel  confused  about people’s actions, I feel  scared  because I fear that people will achieve what they seem to want…  I feel  betrayed  because I have been.  Earlier, I sat in my car and cried, not necessarily because of what people are doing but the preventable pressure they’re putting on others that do not deserve it.  Obviously, what they are doing/have done was also a factor in my sadness, but it was not the main one.  I think the main one is, quite honestly, because I’ve reached my breaking point, the point of no return as  Ice  used to say.    Every word and every action that everyone has done over these past few weeks, whether good or bad was replayed in my mind.  All that was replayed hurt; if it was good then it hurt because it wasn’t happening at that moment and if it was bad, then it was because it did happen at one point in time.  I don’t want to hurt anymore; I’ve done enough of that in my past.  Where’s the 'off' button??  HASTA
