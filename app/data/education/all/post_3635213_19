Earlier today Dave recieved a call from  urlLink Atlantic Southeast Airlines  and was given an offer for a first officer position. He's soooo excited. Now he has to go to Atlanta for about 2-3 months to get trained. After that he will be back in DFW (most likely.) Yeah for the happy news! I didn't have any doubt really because he's an excellent pilot.
