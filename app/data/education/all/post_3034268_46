My life is too comfortable.  I almost wish for a r–  	I was going to write, “for a real tragedy,” but I was writing for someone else to read it.  Every time I write or am in public, it is a performance.  It is only when there is great passion, or when I write for what is written–not for who is reading–that there is any honesty in my words.  I am a dishonest person; dishonest to the world and dishonest to myself.  I am doing it at this very moment.  I keep slipping into it.  I improve for a moment, and then descend again.   	But am I any worse than the other people in this sterile city?  Maybe not everyone.  There are at least a few who seem genuine, or at least have flashes of genuineness more than the norm.   	We are a nation of jerks.  But we are no worse, inherently, than anyone else.  If another group of people had been through what we have been through, they would be just as horrible.  I make it sound as if we are the victims.  In a sense, we are.  But we are victims of ourselves-our decadence is inescapable, and so we are prisoners–but we imprisoned ourselves.  We would break free id we only thought that this cage was a cage. 	I am too egotistic–that is the problem.  I read myself in everything I admire, and in everything I despise as well.  I think about myself more than anything else.  I am doing it now (although at the moment it is necessary).  I like to stare at my face in a mirror–to study it and admire it–and the more beautiful or ugly I perceive it to be, the more I am fascinated by it.   	Is any of this true?  Yes, but not all of it.   	In the suburbs, where life is too easy, the hardest thing is to become strong in honesty, courage and far reaching compassion, and struggle when it is not necessary; when one could be comfortable living as everyone else does.  The American suburbs are sterile.
