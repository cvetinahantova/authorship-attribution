I'm wanting to get out. It eats at me everyday and I can't control it. It rapes everything away from me and I am tired of fighting for my sanity. I love you all very much.  I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain  Just to be with the one he loves  How many times has he broken that promise  It has never been done  I've never climbed the highest mountain  But I walked the hill of Calvary   Just to be with you,I'd do anything  There's not price I would not pay  Just to be with you, I'd give anything  I would give my life away   I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean  Just to be with the one he loves  How many times has he broken that promise  It can never be done  I've never swam the deepest ocean  But I walked upon the raging sea   Just to be with you,I'd do anything  There's not price I would not pay  Just to be with you, I'd give anything  I would give my life away   I know that you don't understand the fullness of My love  How I died upon the cross for your sins  And I know you don't realize how much that I gave you  But I promise, I would do it all again   Just to be with you, I did everything  There's not price I did not pay  Just to be with you, I gave everything  Yes, I gave my life away
