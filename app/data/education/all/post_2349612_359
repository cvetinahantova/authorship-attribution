urlLink     Where do you fall on the liberal - conservative political spectrum?  (United States)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     honestly -- i expected it to tell me "moderate", but ya know... b/c i'm definitely quite a bit more liberal than a lot of my memphis church friends, but i'm definitely quite a bit more conservative than most of my math/grad school friends... either way, there it is :-P  later dudes
