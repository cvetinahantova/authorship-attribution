I'll be the first to buy this if I can--a magazine devoted exclusively to dogs in New York.    urlLink The New York Times %3E Business %3E Media %26 Advertising %3E For Dogs in New York%2C a Glossy Look at Life   Moritz and I are adjusting well to the City. We've found we can jog up and down Riverside Park without a leash, if we do it before 9 (which we failed to do today). Otherwise there are dog runs that he can run in, which are a bit sad, but are filled with other dogs. The City itself is endlessly interesting for a four-legged creature with a good nose. He spends lots of time smelling. He saw a rat the other day, which was almost as good as a squirrel. And he likes to lunge at the pigeons, which are so lazy, indolent, and insolent that they linger and loiter on the sidewalk until he's within an inch or two of them. We're using his walks to help discover the City. Besides Riverside Park, we've explored northern Central Park and Morningside Park--both of which I think used to be considered super dangerous, but which are now totally lovely.
