This week..is weird. I need some coordination or something, because I ran into three people in three hours. I almost killed myself on the first one. :(   Gee, I am so bored with my life, and should be doing my Biology outline. Damnit, why must I?! I hate..everything. As usual. And um, Guria is coming over Monday. Wee. Honestly, life is okay-ish. Clara bothers me. Shush though. I don't know. I just get this extremely weird feeling about her. Sigh, paranoia. Backlashes.   Jolanda's still mad. Ugh. Whatever. I hate this crap. She needs to grow up. >.
