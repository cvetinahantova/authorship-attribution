I will stubbornly resist the urge to throw down the towel, to give up and walk away from the one true source of all power.  I will not lay down and be defeated.  I will take responsibility for my actions in the world and for the quality of my inner world.  I will listen, I will actively engage a loving spirit in an ongoing effort to change, heal, grow, forgive, love.  I will use my energy wisely and will remain mindful in each moment of the power of words, thoughts, media, and the necessity to turn it all over to god.    Sometimes I still wish that there was a magic pill, or potion to take me straight to nirvana, or somewhere perfectly alright all of the time, but I know that realistically I must continue to work daily at practicing right living.  For me this is prayer, meditation, devotional chanting, daily meetings.  If I maintain my commitment to these then I know that eventually everything else will follow.  I have faith that I will be shown the way on the path, that it will become clearer and more potent over time.  I have to trust in the way and the light.
