More English Lit. Hate    "They shouldn't have censored the play because it is supposed to be the age of enlightenment, and that means that they're supposed to accept new ideas" . F*CKING BITCH, IT WAS US WHO CALLED THAT ERA THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT. There was no moment where everyone suddenly looked at the calendar and said "Diddely-doo, today is the first day of the age of enlightenment, let's all go put flower circlets on our heads and listen to new ideas". I should rip out your spleen with a spork dunked in ammonia and jam it up your nose for even thinking of such a retarded thing. And you, stupid bitch, we know what you mean, so DON'T F*CKING REPEAT IT FIFTY TIMES IN A ROW AND ASK IF WE KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. Just shut the f*ck up and think for a second like an adult.
