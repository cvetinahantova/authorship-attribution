There's a student here at the school who has been at the school for longer than 90% of the staff. He is likeable most of the time, but he will turn... Hard to explain. Currently he is roaming the school property, which has construction debris around due to the school being built a year ago. What this boy does is looks for things to make weapons with, and he is quite clever. He has created some num-chucks(?) out of two branches of pine and a piece of chain. He found nails from old wood decking on the property. Unfortunately, this is definitely against the school expectations, not to mention potentially painful. He hasn't really ever intentionally hurt somebody, but has done so in rage and defiant aggressive behavior. I guess it means that he still belongs with us.    Most of the students we get don't stay for more than one and a half to two years. There is a thing in medicine, specifically worker's comp terms, called permanent and stationary. I think we have nothing more at our facility to help this child. We have employed numerous techniques, paradigms, concepts, schemes, and even law enforcement interventions, but to no avail...   I work for the kids, not the system. I don't have to believe in the system in order to help those who are in the system.
