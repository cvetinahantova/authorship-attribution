zzZzZZ im tired. um friday night i spent the night at alyssa's with carina too. We stayed up late even though i was really tired. we went swimming twice while we were there so that was fun. Then on saturday(we woke up at 11.30) we just hung out and I left at about 1:00.Carina and I ate so much candy, then alyssa was taking pictures of rina with her swim suit and a retarded donald duck hat. it was kinda funny. ok so today i was supposed to go ice sking with deni and sarah and nicole and some other people but my mom couldn't drive me anywhere because she had plans tro go to my uncles with my brother and sister. we went to my uncle's house to go swimming in his new mega-huge pool! he has a rockslide, two waterfalls that go into the pool and one waterfall that hangs over the edge of the pool. It's not all finished yet because he still has to pour the concrete around the pool but apparently he is having it poured tomorrow or tuesday. yeah so whenever he does my cousins are going to spend the night. um i have to go to rehearsal tonight at 8-10. It's kinda sucks going that late I wish it was earlier or that we didn't even have to go on sundays. oh well there is nothing i can do but quit...and i don't want to do that. deni--maybe some other weekend we can go skating
