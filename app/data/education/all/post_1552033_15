Okay, the time has come to set the record straight.   I am clinically insane!   Got that?  Are we clear on that point?  I am a complete looney, wacko, headcase, or whatever else you want to call it.  When I was 35 or so I realized just how deep my psychosis runs, and I also realized that a good shrink and lots of modern drugs would probably fix me right up.  The downside, of course, is that then I would be just like everyone else.  The one thing I despise most about the modern world is the subtle, incessant, unyeilding drive toward conformity.  No one notices it, but Hollywood, CNN, BBC, NHK, and everyone else is trying to convince us that we each individually need to be rich, beautiful, successful, and most of all,  sane .  I am not sane and never will be.  Insanity is not fun, but it is who I am and for better or worse, I  like  who I am!  Okay, now that we've got that out of the way.  Let me introduce a new person I have learned to love reading:  urlLink What have I become?   Mika, you are beautiful!  Please don't let the modern world tell you otherwise.  I'd leave a comment or drop you an e-mail, but there's no contact information on your blog.  I don't remember how I first found  urlLink What have I become? , but when I landed on the page the very first thing I saw was the link to  urlLink Megatokyo , a webcomic that I dearly love and read daily.  That and  urlLink Sinfest  are my two favorite online comics.  Anyone who reads  urlLink Megatokyo  is a-okay in my book!  So I hung around and started following the adventures of a misplaced upstate New York girl.  She's great!  She enjoys  urlLink Lodoss  and plays  urlLink Magic: the Gathering .  My god!  If I were half my age I'd move to Seattle!  What are you young guys looking for?  Here's a pretty young woman who enjoys the best things in life and  nobody  is chasing her!  And  I'm  the one they call crazy!
