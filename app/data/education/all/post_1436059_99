DAMNIT!!!!! Excuse the language, I just lost a really long long entry that I...eeeeeeerrrrrrrg!  In short, this week has been SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME. All my friends. I just wanted to say that this year has really taught me true friendship and even if I don't know someone that well it's really great and uplifting just to have a lot of people walk by you and say "Hey, Mallory" or acknowledge you in some way. Kendra, Keniesha, Amanda, Amanda#2, Sarah "Hopper", Andy, Jenny, Jenn, Sarah "SARS", Alex, Kevin, Ryan, Catie, Joey, JessJo, and EVERYONE ELSE: YOU ARE THE COOLEST!  Also, at the meet on Tuesday I did way better, I had some Personal Records:  Last week: Overall Time for 2-Mile: 14:57 Split/Mile Time for 2-Mile: 7:13  This week: Overall: 14:23 Split/Mile: 6:56!!!  I'm so happy. I also applied for the Naval Academy and their Cross-Country distance camp. I also brought up my Algebra scores. YAY!   Now if only God would keep granting me awesome days and give me a snow day tomorrow...
