Savannah goes next week for her work up for the transplant.  Renee and Stan I think are leaving tuesday? and will be back, I think late htursday.  You wouldn't believe how packed in all the appointments are, and Savannah has to be sedated for two of them, which is never good for her.  They have to watch her ammonia, and amino acids very closely when she is sedated.    So pray for them.
