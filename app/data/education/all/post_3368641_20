this season for me has ended I've taken my early retirement from the stage of scripted life and took a seat in the theater  all the roles that I have played rolled off my tongue with ease so comfortable as a chameleon in the vacuous appetites of my peers  we've been attracted to titillation we've been in love with background noise I had not known a moment of peace from the chatter of my own expectations  but I've grown weary of distraction and superficial sweeteners it took only a moment's hold of silence for me to stretch it into eternity  this is the song's lovely lyrics that have always escaped my mind because the words never reached beyond my moving lips to the heart  some go out like a phoenix rising some leave behind new philosophies some alter our perceptive realities and some disappear so effortlessly  I am of this moment of our time a witness to the decline of originality there is truly nothing new under the sun that hasn't been already screwed up to perfection  Â©2003 DC Vision
