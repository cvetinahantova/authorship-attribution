urlLink Character Education through Children's Literature. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Shawna Brynildssen.  It looks at the issue of character education as it can be taught using children's literature.  From the ERIC Digest:  The issue of character education has recently received much attention at both the state and federal level. Legislators, teachers, and parents are all grappling with how best to instill in America's youth not merely information but also the character traits known to promote success and happiness in life, and which will best enable young people to maximize their use of their education and knowledge. One approach that shows particular promise is that of using children's literature as a pedagogical device.   Some educators believe that literature can be a very powerful tool. According to Weaver (1994), "Literary characters have almost the same potential for influencing the reader as the real people with whom a reader might share a reading experience" (pp. 33-34). Given this, the implications for literature's role in character education are great. This digest will examine some of the pertinent issues surrounding this important method of instruction.
