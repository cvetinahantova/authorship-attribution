Listen to my prayer spoken without guile                                              By Scott    i bought a pair of nice expensive shoes on friday. recently i have broken up with my girlfriend and have been frequenting bars and parties to validate my score on the gender scale. a classy young professional woman who must have impressed me made a remark that has stuck with me for the course of the week: "He looks like he cares about things." she said it w/r/t a man we saw while peoplewatching, and although she would never be as careless as to use the term "metrosexual," this neologism gives you the idea. so i decided to buy some nice expensive shoes. i would begin to care about things, too.   the following night i wore my new shoes out to a friend's birthday party. i was all set to show them off. giving them a good scrub before i left, i had a bounce in my step, no doubt from the great care i imagined a small european man with suspenders put into the craftmanship of their soles. i arrived, got buzzed in, and climbed the three floors of stairs to be greeted by not by a friendly hello but instead by a yellow post-it on the door. It read "Please remember to take off your shoes." I noticed the hallway littered with pumps, sneakers, go-go boots, even some nice expensive shoes crafted in a similar manner as mine. I knocked on the door and stepped in. "please take off your shoes," my host asked me, reiterating the post-it. "we don't want to disturb our downstairs neighbors." i looked at all the shoes in the hallway, and was going to respond "well why have 50 people in your apartment getting drunk if you are concerned about your neighbors," but this host didn't know me very well, i knew the birthday girl, his roommate, and i wanted to be a good guest and respect his wishes. so, the shoes came off. after all, i reasoned,  urlLink how often do you really look at a man's shoes.   i heard about the "uninviteds" from the host, toward the end of the party. he had just spoken to three drunk men from "the neighborhood," who tried to crash the party, easing their way into the foyer of the apartment, sniffing their noses high, like booze hounddogs. the host had nicely told them in his friendliest, most patronizing voice, "sorry guys, the party's winding down." then he abruptly closed the door on them. he told me this, and a girl with whom he was attending the university with said, "well handled." i may not be getting a master's degree, but i know this party host had neglected another principle from the bastion of knowledge we call society yet again. i rushed as fast as i could out of the apartment.   of course it was too late. our host "handled" the situation of three drunk strangers on his doorstep so "well" that they had made off with over 30 pairs of shoes, including my nice expensive pair. i spun off the bannister, hopping stairs, gaining velocity as i descended. perhaps because of my speed and momentum, i was in a state where saw everything laid out before me, including the next hour in the future. everything that was to happen i already knew to be. i knew i would burst out of the apartment building into the night, that there would shoes awaiting me, that most of the shoes would be abandoned, probably in an asinine place (surely, the middle of the street). i knew the bandits weren't bandits, they were  urlLink pranksters . and i knew as such the pranksters would return. it was only a matter of waiting. wearing only my left shoe that i found in the street, i waited, poking my head around in trash cans and hedges, hunting for my absconded shoe.   i had a lot of time to think about the party host, since i was alone down on the street with my right foot freezing due to the damp pavement, and he was upstairs "hosting," a skill which already netted him 5 missing shoes (the rest were recovered by myself and my friends  urlLink Darrell and Gideon , both of whom were fiercely ready to rumble with this party host). but i saw all of this already. i knew we just had to wait. i thought about asking the party host to pay for my shoes, since justice left the responsibilty for their abduction on his shoulders as well as mine. i thought how, if i was the party host, i would offer. but this party host as i mentioned did not live in a world where shoes are stolen, or worn in the house, or make less noise than the 80s dance jams blaring out the stereo. i decided it's useless to argue with  urlLink someone  so entrenched in a world where you do not see what will be, your prayers are not answered, and you speak only to avoid the guile of others. we grew up differently, i said to myself, and i cannot blame anyone.    the pranksters did return, and we gave chase, but i had one shoe, and we knew they didn't have the shoes on them. they made off.   if this blog be the place for frustration, for rants, know that i currently wear one shoe and have a sore jaw from grinding my teeth so much. my shoe was found the following morning sleeping beneath a nearby car. of course, i've got to go there to pick it up.
