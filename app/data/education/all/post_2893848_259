Bueller by Scott  Today is one of those days in Chicago that come maybe once a summer. Most of my day is being spent here, in the park, with an AirPort. I recommend these yuppie devices. I've been thinking about Law & Order and how McCoy and the gang always try to blow the lid off of some travesty not getting enough press: online gambling, crooked adoptions (also online), small cameras placed strategically in Starbucks bathrooms. Like anyone, I am in love with Law & Order, but I see it approaching a crisis when it grabs "stories from the headlines." I do not want to be influenced by McCoy's stubborn jurisprudence. When McCoy impedes on reality, the future gets manipulated, since L&O works in an hour form, whereas the real case won't be judged for months, years. But this nonsense won't stop L&O from making an episode out of someone killing a dude who grabbed a foul ball and caused his baseball team to lose. I don't like when fiction "gets a boost" from the shit that's supposed to be stranger than it.   On another topic: Here, read a snippet of a real good essay by  urlLink my boss .
