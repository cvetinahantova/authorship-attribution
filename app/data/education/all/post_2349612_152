eric and me had said if it continued to pour down rain tonight we'd go run around and get soaked for fun... but it stopped pouring while he was in band rehearsal... unfortunate  leigh, colleen, and i spent a bit this afternoon calling places for apartment ads for next year.  visiting a place tomorrow afternoon and another on friday afternoon... hopefully one or the other pans out to be good for us.  just finished watching the dateline behind the scenes special of the apprentice.  it was entertaining. season finale is tomorrow... i am such an addict.  no homework due til tuesday, so i'm taking a night off to read and whatever =)  philly in 3 days! =)  the end.
