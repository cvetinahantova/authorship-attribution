I haven't written in a bit.  So many things are going on in my life right now, and unfortunately none I can speak of.  You know how it is.. people might find stuff out, and that would be bad.  So... it slightly defeats the purpose of having ablog if you can't even write about the stuff you think you should get off your chest.  Meh.  What can you do?   I'm not sure if you've noticed, but when I am upset, or stressed.. I tend to do some creative writing.  This will mean nothing to you, and everything to me.     What I found in  you   Sitting in the same spot For over an hour Holding the phone I thought this would be easy I wait for a knock on the door I search for something in you Glass shattered on the floor I. Feel. Brushed off becomes my middle name I am not fond. I'm in this game until I lose The game is ending soon Too attached to what I've found What I found in you.
