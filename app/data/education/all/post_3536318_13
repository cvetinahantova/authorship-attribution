Something I saw in the metro station reminded me of this one liner. So I'm going to post it.  And since there are plenty of these easy-to-read one liners to go around for awhile, I'll post one every so often to get a smile out of you.   An escalator can never break. It can only become stairs. You would never see an "Escalator Temporarily Out Of Order" sign, just "Escalator Temporarily Stairs. Sorry for the convenience."    and a bonus quote for the day:   I had a bag of fritos, they were texas grilled fritos. These fritos had grill marks on them. Hell yeah, reminds me of something, when we used to fire up the barbeque and throw down some fritos. I can still see my dad with the apron on, better flip that frito, dad, you know how I like mine.   ahhhh. simple pleasures...
