urlLink The International Directory - www.skaffe.com  There appears to have been a dispute over at the volunteer editing community Goguides.org.  A new site (Skaffe.com) featuring the work of the GoGuide editors has emerged.  Many of the editors at GoGuides seem to have moved over to Skaffe.com.  The fate of the original GoGuides site is uncertain.  As volunteer edited directories are important in helping users navigate the Web, this development is troubling. Yet, perhaps two strong directories will emerge where there used to be only one.  The more sites that return results based on relevance and not advertising, the better web searchers are.  Other volunteer created directories include the  urlLink Open Directory Project ,  urlLink Zeal , and  urlLink Joeant .  These are all more stable than GoGuides and their results can be found influencing search engines all over the Web including Google.
