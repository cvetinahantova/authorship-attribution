So, this morning, I am flying on only 3 short hours of sleep.  (I got super involved in my book, of which I was only planning on reading 2 chapters when I lay down to go to bed, but ended up finishing it!)  I do recommend it to anyone who is slightly romantic.  It changed me into one while I read.  But, alas, all good things must, sadly, come to an end.  Hehe!  I don't know exactly what we are planning to do today, but I think we will go to the baseball game tonight.  You know what that means...NAP!  Yeah, baby!  I love those things.  Notice the paragraph at top...I have learned to rely on naps.  Ok, so I am trying to gear up for next semester.  18 hours, and 15 of them Engineering classes.  I dunno.  I think I got myself in pretty deep.  But, I can handle it.  Please pray for me and for Dabbie-girl, that we will have ample amounts of time together.  It's far-fetched, I know, but I can dream, can't I?  Time to go, but I want to leave you with this thought.  If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, what would you do today?
