I am going on a vacation.  My job is not demanding of my time, but it does suck the life right out of me.  So, I decided last night that I am going on a vacation.  I don't know how, when, or with what money... but  I am going.   Well, I do have a few ideas... One of those all-inclusive places - Beaches, maybe even Hedonism II.  I want to go to Jamacia.  I'm going to be 35 this fall, and think it would be a really cool way to celebrate.    I'll call for information tomorrow.
