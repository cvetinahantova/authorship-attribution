I can't stand it!!!! Milan in 44 days!! Duomos and Operas ( at Piazza della Scala)  and Versace, Oh My!! Who knows how much longer I have in OKC because I may go to G-town for awhile to visit the parents.  One thing is for sure....I am counting the days left at work.  Lets see...18 more working days and 5 hours.  I will be unemployed for about two weeks and I just can't wait.  I haven't been unemployed since I was 12 years old.  I am so ready.      I really don't have anything exciting to write about yet. I could gripe some more about all the stuff I have to do to get ready to go but...you cares. I don't even want to hear it.      I am starting to feel really scared and apprehensive at this point in time.  I have met several people that are amazing that will be teaching with me, but I am leaving quite a bit here.  Honestly, it will probably all be here when I get back, but still things and people and events will be truly missed.      (PS. Winston better be alive when I get back)     I am really scared about selling my car. I have put it on auto trader and at high traffic areas such as people's work, but does any one have any suggestions as to how I can get rid of this thing?
