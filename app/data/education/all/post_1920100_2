Hello this first blog is dedicated to two special people in my life that have been asking for me to create a blog. Yes you know who you are the beautiful Rhema and my beautiful boyfriend Sergio. I hope I can keep up with this and let you into my world through the thoughts I will post up on this website. Well for now I have to go to class but I hope to keep you guys and others who read this updated.   Before I say good bye just wanted to say....Count your blessings each day and double them by blessing others....wendy
