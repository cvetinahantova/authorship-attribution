We talked about taking risks today, I think a risk for me right now would be to allow someone to become a friend to me. I'm so scared that I will give all that I can to make them feel special and important only to be hurt and disappointed in the end by them leaving or not caring for me as much as I do them. Does that make sense? I hope so.
