Current stack of books at my bedside: 	Neuropolitics: Thinking, Culture, Speed (Theory Out of Bounds) ~William E. Connolly. This book is good, but the style is very American and the thesis a bit wishy-washy. The Puppet and the Dwarf, Organs without Bodies. Both classic Zizek, though the latter slides around its themes a lot. Keith Ansell Pearson’s review was right about him quoting secondary texts too much. The New Schelling. Just got this, looks good for a book of academic essays. Schelling is a fashionably unfashionable philosopher for me. I always follow the minor current, trouble is it keeps taking over the mainstream. Stories I Stole: A Journey to Georgia. Wendell Steavenson. Preliminary reading for my next teaching destination. Kind of unnerving. It certainly is a crazy place. I’ve really to build up my resistance to alcohol before I get there. Incidentally. Wendell Steavenson to judge by her picture is a stunningly attractive lass with something of the Susan Sontag about her. www.citypages.com/.../ 24_1167/24_1167a11188.jpg
