We are still in the process of finalizing the hotel and pasta dinner details, but here are the details I can give you at this point...  We are going to stay at either Villa Florence or Crown Plaza Hotel in Union Square.  The negotiated room rate at both hotels is $135 per night.  We are leaning toward Villa Florence due to contract details.  Either way, you will have a great room at a high end hotel.  Regarding the pasta dinner, we are negotiating with the hotels to have a dinner in one of their banquet rooms.  So far, there are roughly 80 people who responded "yes" to the pasta dinner!  It would be best to have a dinner with a set menu and price (including tax and tip), instead of trying to find a restaurant that can accommodate us all.  It looks as though the dinner, including a pasta and meat dish, salad, drinks (iced tea, etc.), coffee and dessert will be roughly $30 a head (but don't quote me on that just yet!).  It will be such a wonderful pre-race celebration to have us all together in the same place at the same time, eating instead of running/walking!!!  When all is set, I will post a follow-up message on the Blog.  ALSO...remember to register for the race ASAP!  Go to www.nike.com/nikemarathon to register.  Make sure you register for the Half (not the Full) AND sign up for the shuttle service.  -- Wendy
