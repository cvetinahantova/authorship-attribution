So, I have been at volleyball camp since yesterday, here in Everman and it is kickin' my tail. I hurt in places that I forgot I could hurt in. LOL!!!! Demonstrations are killers. Anyway, I am having a great time. I am having to broaden my horizons and learn names like 'Obshanique' and 'Jaquesia', but other than that, the girls and I are getting along pretty well. I am sooooo tired, but I got a two hour nap this afternoon. Anyway, thought I would keep you posted. I am not missing home as of yet, but I think it is in the near future. I love you all. Talk to you soon.
