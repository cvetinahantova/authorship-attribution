I don't wanna write, which means I have to write at least five sentences.  I have some ideas for a project, which I have been hand writing, and I have homework that needs to be completed.  As I write this, I'm trying to not look at the keys.  It's tricky, but I can do this.  LOL.  Man you just gotta love praticing, cause it can only make me better.  I wrote this journal entry.
