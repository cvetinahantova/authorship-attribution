Professor not well today, so I'm in class typying something for this journal.  Will go home and rest nerves.  A thunderstorm is comming, so I want to be done with the computer when I leave the campus.  I was tired this morning, and it seemed to trickle down to class time.  I'm getting something to eat, then I'm going home, then onto work later.  The good news is that its the "hump" day, so once it's over, I can breathe again.  My nose is running like a leaky facuett.  When I excuse myself to blow it, it dries up.  Go figure.
