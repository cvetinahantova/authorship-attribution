Hey! Right now I'm in 3rd period computer applications. Everyone is talking about how our teacher should sing to us. Its weird, he said that he has a good voice and yet he wont sing =/. That's alright though. I don't want him to sing if he sings to the music that he is playing now =/.  Over the past few days I have been babysitting. That is mostly what my day consists of now days. School, babysitting, and sleep. I barely have time to fit in sleeping! It's just getting bad, though, because my mom will say that she will baby sit for my sister, then she pushes it off on to me. But don't take it in a bad way. I love my little niece, but it's just that I can't do everything that I want to. I guess I can't always have my way though. And I don't really mind about that...I didn't have much of a life before...LOL. It's all good though, I like having a little one around the house. Despite the dirty diapers, I love babysitting. Anyways, I got to go, so I will write back later! Bye!
