............ quilts ............  am just trying to get prepped for the semester -- the front burner flame is on high -- but I'm excited about the flames (a switch from last semester).  Have been really enjoying hearing from old friends.  Marcaus' voice returned to his blog, and I happened to stumble across a number of old pictures and emails when i cleaned my old computer up -- its good to have old friends who remain true and connected.  I have a deep sense of that.   My mentor from my MA at Andrews, Bev, sent me a handwritten letter. She often does.  It's SO good to get a real live LETTER.  And so good to feel that someone from the past who invested in you still cares.  She'd never know how deeply appreciative I continue to be of her voice in my life from the lack of my correspondence, but I am (deeply appreciative).   We spent new years eve with Greg, Andrea & tribe.  It was warm, honest, caring, delicious, rich, heady time.  Its amazing when you are friends with people from a long time and you start to recognize how much you've changed individually, but how the arcs and rhythms and patterns of your lives continue to be so intersected...  Have I mentioned that I'm obsessed by quilts these days.  Not making them or even looking at them, just wrapping them around me and doing whatever -- reading, movies, writing, talking....  My wife's family has made billions of amazing quilts and they're draped all over this house, but they seem to me to be the perfect object -- an INCARNATION of all that I'm feeling about me and the world right now.    I'm feeling bolstered, secured, warmed, kept and loved by these meaningful connections with people who have loved me for a long time and in really unique ways...The patterns that are emerging in these long-time friendships are unexpected -- they stitch together different parts to the fabric of my life that I couldn't have expected to work together in the ways that they do...  But I feel warmed, filled, re-membered.  peace~.
