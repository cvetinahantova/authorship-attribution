Since I'm currently visiting with my parents I cannot post about some stuff that I normally would. Particularly the fight that resulted after my mom found out that my dad knew I had a blog and she didn't.  Bullshit all of it.  I swear it was a days of our lives moment and my mom was Jan Spears (psycho..much?).  I thank all of you who are still willing to read me despite the moving of the blog.  Thanks so much.  Anyway, right now we are painting a room in my parents house for Shorty and my nephew D.  I have never painted a room before and I never realized just how much work was really entailed in doing so.  I didn't know that I ever needed to "cut in" before I actually painted the wall.  So when I managed to get a section of the freshly painted ceiling blue, my dad about flipped.  But, he was okay with it.  I think he still feels guilty and a little paint mishap isn't nearly as bad as what he did to me.  While I could continue to post, shorty has gotten himself into trouble.  More Later,
