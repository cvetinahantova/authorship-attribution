Still feeling hungry although sleep levels were high last night - thank God! Still not heard off the car dealer though and having rung after him, it seems he is off on leave today. I need to get the cancellation confirmed so that I can buy a cheap car, preferrably for the weekend. I've got to work on Saturday too, so it should be a busy time.  I feel better within myself over the last couple of days, although I have a boss who moans when I get into work 15 minutes early (thats got to be a first!). I try to explain that I travel 18 miles down motorways, through 3 sets of roadworks at rush hour - some days I may be early, some days I may be held up - its just the way it goes, but he just doesn't seem to get it! He never used to moan when his mate stopped over an hour later until 6pm everyday because he arrived and hour late after taking his kids to school.
