My crazy best friend...  So yeah, just when I think I've got guys all figured out... my best friend and I were talking today about a situation she's in- she knows some guy likes her, right? And she's been kinda holding out to let him take the lead ('cuz that's something she feels he really needs to do.) Then suddenly, on Wed., this other guy gets all affectionate with her- holding her hand, dancing w/ her, wrapping his arms around her waist, etc. Except HE'S just supposed to be her friend... and he's also supposed to be interested in another girl... huh?  Of course... she doesn't know what she feels about either of them... oi vey!
