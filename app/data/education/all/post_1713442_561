urlLink Technology Professional Development: Successful Strategies for Teacher Change. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Harvey Barnett.  It shows ways that technology training can better teaching.  From the ERIC Digest:  The goal of any professional development program is to inform and change teacher behavior as a result of new information. To this end, teachers and other educators spend countless hours in professional development activities learning to use new instructional strategies or materials. Sometimes there is change, and sometimes the person goes right back to doing what he or she had been doing all along. Bob Pearlman, Director of Strategic Planning, New Technology Foundation, said once in a speech, "Anybody who thinks they can inculcate teachers with anything on a mandatory basis is nuts." The trick then is to design your professional development activities in a way that ensures that teachers' time and your investment in time and money pay off in increased student achievement.   Getting teacher buy in is important when technology is involved, especially for those who are not convinced technology is worth the time and effort. The first step of any sound professional development program is to develop a belief about technology professional development that includes the idea that the curriculum drives the use of technology, not vice-versa, and that empowered teachers will find appropriate ways to include technology with their ongoing instruction rather than view it as an activity unconnected to the district's content standards. Research and best teaching practices consistently show that without effective staff development and continuous support, technology integration will never be satisfactorily achieved (Bailey and Powell, 1998).
