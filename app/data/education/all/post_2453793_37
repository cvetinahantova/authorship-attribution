well, i have great news!  the reason i haven't posted in a few days is because on monday i found out amber got her job.  monday night we looked at a few apartments.  tuesday we handed in some applications and got an apartment.  i'm really excited.  we got the apartment we wanted and it's extremely cute.  a little on the small side but that's part of what makes it cute.  we had actually looked at a huge one but decided that we'd rather have a place with personality.  we're going to be living right by all of the mansions on summit ave. and close to all the trendy places on grand ave.  i'm so excited.  the best part is that i'm not going to be living with these silly boys anymore.  i hope we keep in touch though, which i'm unsure of what their plans are as far as that goes.  i've been getting the vibe that as soon as i'm out that they are cutting all ties with me.  i think that would be pretty immature of them.  anyway, my clock is extremely off and i'm not sure what time it is but either way, i really should be getting ready for work so i'll post later tonight and provide details of my new maison.  :)
