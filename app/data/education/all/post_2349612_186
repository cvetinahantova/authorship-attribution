woke up this morning after horrible horrible bad dreams (planes exploding, people dying, yucky stuff in general) to think "dude, i'm in a bad mood" and went right back to sleep to not have to deal with myself for a bit.  eventually decided that the only thing that was going to keep my bad mood from getting worse was keeping busy, so eric and me went to subway and then worked on algebra at starbucks all afternoon... now after grocery shopping, and movie hunting, it's dinner and mooovie night... brother bear (my choice... i bought it -- i've been excited since i saw it last november w/ margie in the theater) and the negotiator (eric's choice)... reviews later tonight.  can you get much more of a contrast?  later dudes.
