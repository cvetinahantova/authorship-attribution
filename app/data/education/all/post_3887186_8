This is my first enrty for EDU 3234 course. On the 8th of July 2004, we have had a long discussion on positon and research paper with Dr. Edwin, but the focuses are more on how to choose title and construct the thesis statement for both paper. As usual Dr. Edwin carried out brainstorming activity in order to tackle our understanding. According to my understanding, thesis statement should be strong, assertive summary of our own interpretation. Thesis statement of a literary paper cannot be too broad or too vague.   Some examples given by my lecturer's are :-  1. Women upliftment in society is through education.  2. Unfulfilment in marriages lead to infidelity.  3. Emily is a victim of a patrichal society.   I am still looking forward for my thesis statement for my position paper as being assigned by Dr. Edwin as a homework for this week. I think I would like to work on poems.   (112299)
