Gonna find my baby...gonna hold her tight...gonna grab some afternoon delight.  My motto's always been while it's right it's right why waitin til the middle of the cold dark night... Oh haha Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon delight!  Wow...that movie is just hilarious.  All fun: full of laughs.  Will Ferrell was awesome and I also gotta say Steve Carell (Brick Tamland) made me laugh my ass off.  Kudos to the crew of Team 4.  That movie kicked some serious ass.   I wore my 70s shirt.  Hey, if you are one of the unlucky people on this site that saw White Chicks instead of Anchorman, you missed out.  I mean that as a friendly joke but it's true.  You stay classy Local Cafe!
