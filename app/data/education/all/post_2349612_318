well at least news and drinks, but whatever =P  two links i stole from two friends blogs -- but i don't think anyone else knows the both of them, so there's something new for everyone :-)  (1)  "For Some, the Blogging Never Stops"  (from the New York Times last week) -- maybe i write a lot, but i don't write in here in *place* of social interaction =P  (2)  pop vs. soda (vs. coke)  -- see the country in a whole new way =)  it's 12:30 and all i've done today is finish reading the copy of  mental floss magazine  that i picked up in ohio on my last roadtrip... need to track down the june/july issue soon... lunch then starting to work -- ah, the life of a telecommuter is glorious =)
