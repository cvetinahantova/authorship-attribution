Raspberry Filled    urlLink   What Kind of Krispy Kreme Doughnut Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Not really.  I haven't even been online for a whole three days!  However, I stopped in at  urlLink Last Day of My Life  and he was a good old-fashioned glazed donut, so I thought, "What the heck!  Can't hurt!", and then skipped over to the quiz.  It was great fun!  An interesting aside:  I have never tasted a Krispy Kreme donut, but I   love   Raspberry jam!
