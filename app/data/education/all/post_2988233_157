Renee's home, Renee's home!  I just got off the phone with her, they had a great time, Savannah missed me and wanted to go to Gee's house one day while they were gone.  She also wanted "bean" to come play with her in the sand.  Bean is her name for son #4.    Just had to share the excitement.  I missed my friend.
