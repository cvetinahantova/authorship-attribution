Strange day today. This morning we finalised the re-mortgage. After work I was due to meet a girl (Sharon) from the internet dating site, but I cancelled in favour of looking at cars. I found one eventually, after being held up by roads being closed due to a major fire and getting involved with a road traffic accident - a boy had been run over on his bike, while trying to cross the road. He was fine, but abusive to everyone in sight, including the Asian lady involved and another witness. Anyway, I put 100 UKP down as a deposit after settling on an 1994 Fiesta from a very nice couple as it had only dome 37000 miles and seemes a genuine car.
