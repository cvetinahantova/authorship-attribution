urlLink Applying Cognitive-Behavioral Techniques to Social Skills Instruction. ERIC/OSEP Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Stephen Smith.  It examines how cognitive-behavioral techniques can be used to teach social studies.  From the ERIC Digest:  For any teacher, managing student behavior in the classroom can be difficult and complex, but when successful, teachers may find behavior management professionally rewarding. Often, however, managing student behavior is personally involving and professionally frustrating. Students of all ages will sometimes engage in behavior that includes disrespect for authority, hyperactivity and inattention, lack of self-control, and sometimes aggression. Behavioral excesses and deficits detract from learning opportunities and preclude positive peer relationships. Despite the best efforts, teachers and school administrators are continuously looking for behavior management programs that can be implemented school-wide for all students along with specific interventions that can help those students who need more attention.
