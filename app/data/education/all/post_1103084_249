Just finished an hour and a half of writing.  He's about to drop the cyanide into the wineglass, but I thought I'd save that for tomorrow morning.  I think I've set it up believably, though.   Had two cups a joe.  One english muffin with lemon curd melted into the nooks and crannies, and in anywhere from   one minute to one hour (that's right, i'll be on the precipice of individuality  and parenthood for all that time or just that little bit of time), someone will call out:  DADDY! and I'll:   1. run upstairs and we'll spend about 30-40 minutes waking up, making up stories, tickling and remembering the good old days (specifically, yesterday and the day before)  2. we'll have pancakes, probably with sprinkles cooked into them.   3. we'll bathe in mosquito spray and then ride training-wheeled-bikes at evil-kneivel speeds (addison carefully removing and then replacing his bike helmet EACH time he gets on and off of his bike)  4. we'll play with little people (rough plot line probabilities: the people go to camp.  the people go swimming.  the mommy and the daddy go off to work.  the honies (which is, for whatever reason, what the kids are called) will misbehave and be punished, and/or there will be a volcano and dinosaurs will attack.)  5.  We'll put away our toys (four times).    6. We'll invent a dinner menu. Something on the grill surely.  7.  Based on weather, I'll mow the lawn or not.  8. I'll consider, but decide against:   - cleaning out the gutters,  - power washing the siding - weeding the mulchbeds - painting the entryway and the door  9. a telemarketer will call.  I'll politely let them know that its not a good time.  10. we may go to the YMCA pool based on how many good decisions everyone makes.  11. Mommy will return from bringing home the bacon and we will take a family walk around the circle.  hope your day is full of:   peace~
