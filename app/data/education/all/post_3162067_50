I'm not quite feeling myself today. I have a terible sore throat and earache and I'm torn between wanting to go to bed and staying on the computer all night. The latter will probably win as I have 2 job-application profiles to complete on-line and a story to type up, both needing to be done tonight, but I'm feeling a little ucky, and I wanna cuddle but Si's in London and won't get back home until 11.15pm. School was rubbish today: I had to do literacy with year 7's all day and, whilst I was glad that I didn't have to teach my grotty year 10s (and never will again!!!!!!!) I had to contend with year 7s: a year group who, by and large, are absolutely vile! We wrote poems and I really couldn't have cared less about the whole deal. Sigh. Must ring my osteopath.
