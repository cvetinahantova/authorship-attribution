SUNDANCE  I just got back from the  urlLink Sundance  Film Festival in Park City, Utah.  It was cold and the first time I've seen snow in like 2 years.  Crazy, huh.  These are the major films I saw.

We also saw a bunch of shorts    urlLink This  is at the premiere of Nina's Tragedies.  I was in the audience.    urlLink This  is at the "Second Best' premiere.  I was in the audience when this was taken too.  Don't see it.  It's Second Worst, next to  urlLink 'Plan 9' .  I had a great time at Sundance.  It inspired me to make movies.  I want to make a documentary about something cool.
