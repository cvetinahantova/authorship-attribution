Exaltation & Treason   Thursday's Exalted game finally picked up the pace... Lots of weird shit happening. Pat's character got poisoned by Morgan and Matt's characters ("It was only supposed to knock him out" - riiiiight), Layla revealed another corner of her character's twisted thinking and took over Pat's legions, and me... Hehe, well, let's say that I got the opportunity to pull the party around by their nose. They have  NO  idea of what's in play for them *evil laugh*. I almost feel pity for the poor sods... No, wait, who am I kidding? No pity.
