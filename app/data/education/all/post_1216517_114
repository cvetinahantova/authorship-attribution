I am excited about going home to Michigan. I'll be there for at least a month. I haven't been there for over 2 weeks at one time in about 4 years. It'll be childhood clashing with adulthood. There will be memories abounding. Time to reminice. I'm game. I'll go visit my school. Hang out with childhood friends. Ride my bike around town. Read in the park. Then I will come back to California satisfied, with a new job hopefully.  I'm very positive about the itv job. I'll find out in 3 weeks and start in November if it all works out. If it falls through, I will work overseas. Boo-yah.  One way or the other, I will win.
