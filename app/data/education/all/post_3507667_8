Well work is almost over and then 4 days off. I think I'm going take the girls to see Shrek 2 tonight. I've heard some good things about it and apparently the cat played by Antonio Banderas is just hilarious.  I'd like to take a second and again thank urlLink Lisa  for the help with my Blog on the  urlLink new site . It needs quite a bit of work and hopefully I can get the comments section up and running.   Oh, the Ninja Chipmunk hasn't shown on the trail again yet so Winter is safe so far. Hope it appears though, I can always use a good laugh.   -RLB
