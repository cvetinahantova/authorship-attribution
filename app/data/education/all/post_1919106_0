Monday Gaming   It seems like I have competition now. We had some of Charles' meat (venison) and we all liked it. Of course, it was me who breaded it *wink wink*. My character was a bit useless during the game. I pretty much just sat there with Charles' character betting on who would get hurt first, betting that Morgan would drop his rock on his foot and lose HP, just betting... and the one time where I got to swing at an orc I roll a friggen 4... I guess I should have cast true strike instead. Oh well, we all leveled up yesterday, and I'm picking a fighter level over mage. Sure, the group would be better off if I'd choose to be a mage, but that just won't work with my character - he's a fighter that chose to know a bit about magic, but he's not 100% interested in it (just enough to be able to kill a certain other mage.) That, and I get another feat for picking up fighter. I'll definitively get Exotic Weapon Proficiency - Dwarven Waraxe so that I can use it one-handed. The other feat might be Quick Draw, but I'm not 100% sure about that (I'll have to ask Jeff if the holster for the axe I got provides the same functionality as Quick Draw, since he said it would allow my character to draw the axe quicker than normal.) Or maybe I'll pick up Improved Called Shot, but my crit range is bad to start with anyway... or perhaps I'll get up Power Charge. Well, I'll first have to see whether I need Quick Draw or not.
