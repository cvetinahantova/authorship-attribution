urlLink Using Standardized Test Data To Guide Instruction and Intervention. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Craig Mertler.  It views methods that can be used to translate testing data into meaningful measures that can help students.  From the ERIC Digest:  Test publishing companies typically provide classroom-level reports to enable teachers to see how a group of students performs across the curriculum. Even if a group of students has moved on by the time score reports are available, teachers should examine class-level results as a source of information for revising curriculum and instruction for the next class. Content areas or subtests in which high percentages of children are performing below average indicate areas of deficiency.    Once teachers have noted and prioritized deficiencies, they may consider one or more of the following questions:    * Where is this content addressed in our district's curriculum?    * At what point in the school are these concepts/skills taught?    * How are the students taught these concepts/skills?    * How are students required to demonstrate that they have mastered the   concepts/skills? In other words, how are they assessed in the classroom?
