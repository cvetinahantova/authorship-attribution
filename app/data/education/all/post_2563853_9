I have thought about it and have decided to give blogging another try. I will try to post every morning or afternoon, but it may become every other day. It is just as my schedule permits! I am also thinking of switching to a new blogging service, I will post more about that if I decide to. On a side note, keep watching for gmail invites for those who want them. You never know when they are going to be posted. Have a great day.
