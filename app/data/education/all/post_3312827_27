Ok, so the first day on the job wasn't too bad...  I was only there for 2 1/2 hours.  The owner, Delores, showed me how to set up the place for the day and how to work the computer.  Tomorrow is my first real day on the job, actually waitressing.  Wish me luck.  Boy didn't call today.  I sent him a text message this morning, saying that I hoped he had a better day and good luck on the test he had to make up.  All I got back was a terse, "Thanks."  Maybe I'm just overreacting.  I always get so worried that no matter what I do, or how hard I DON'T try, things just don't work out.  Take Nic, the Air Force guy, as an example.  That wasn't even supposed to be a long-term thing.  But yet, two weeks before he's set to ship off, he drops me like a bad habit.  I don't know the reason.  He just stopped calling.  I don't even know if I did anything wrong.  Shawn doesn't even talk to me anymore.  God only knows what happened there.  I'm starting to feel like I can't hold it together anymore.  I have so much going on in my life, so much weight on my shoulders, and I can't feel like I can brush it off.  I sit here and I worry about so many things:  my dad, money, love.  It sucks feeling as alone as I do right now.  I wish there was a more poetic way of putting it, but I can't find the words.  It just SUCKS.  Now watch, tomorrow will be better.  That's just the way that it is.  He'll call, and I'll be fine.  I'll realize I overreacted over something so stupid, over a guy I've known for 3 days, and I'll laugh about it.  But... until then... I'll just sit here and wait.
