I love to read my weekly horoscope from Rob Brezsny's  urlLink Free Will Astrology .  That man has had some insights into my soul like no one else.  On the day before I defended my master's thesis, I was compelled to go get the Coast in order to read my horoscope.  I figured that I needed the guidance, since I was so nervous, my anxiety was nearly overwhelming me.  It was raining out, and I still made the pilgrimmage.  And when I finally read it, it was like the clouds opened up (they didn't really - it was still raining).  My horoscope for that week was all about how I was a genius, with the potential to do amazing things.  It was my time to shine, and follow my soul's code.  I was about to do something great.  From then on, I have been religious about reading Rob's guidance (I wouldn't really call then predictions).  Anyway, this is my horoscope this week:  Each day many of your cells expire and are replaced by others. As long as you live, this relentless process of death and rebirth never abates. Periodically, then, you have a completely new set of flesh and bones that retains none of the same atoms you were composed of earlier. Think back, for example, to the physical body you inhabited in July of 1999. There is nothing left of that old thing! In a sense, you have reincarnated without having to endure the inconvenience of dying. Do you realize how free this makes you? In the coming week, Scorpio, take full advantage of this gift. Show how much you appreciate it.    What the fuck does that mean?
