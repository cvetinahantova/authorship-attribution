What a fucking day, the weirdest ass day I've had for a long while. Went to A and B blah, blah, blah... Went to lunch, haven't eaten all day... Probably should, maybe... Got to MV late 'cause Jen had to go to C-Block, went to Cibellis with Trevor, Adrian and Katherine... Had fun, made jokes etc... Felt like crap the rest of the day, made an idiot of myself... Drama sucked, didn't want to be there at all... Really tried to laugh but no, Jason didn't like that I wasn't in a good mood... Him and I always have fun in Drama, but yeah. Was doing alright 'til after C-Block, oh well... Ups and fucking downs, have to deal with 'em. What a waste...
