The night air is kind of dry in southern Idaho. Oh great now I am thirsty thinking about the dry air. This summer is the hottest, well I don’t know for sure, summer I have spent in Idaho. I heard something about the sun and its direction with the Earth or something, I don’t know, the weather is just strange.   Question: What do you do if you don’t like the weather in Idaho? Answer:   Just wait 5 minutes and it will change.  It seems to be true. I once saw it snow, well looked like snow, just in May, and now it’s July. Wow, the weather, I sometimes wonder what God was thinking when he made it. I just know that it is interesting and can’t wait to find out why God made things the way they are. The only answer I can think of is,   “For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving” (1 Timothy 4:4).  I just like looking up to the stars and wonder how everything is made, what a perfect design the Father has made. I mean if we were made different, like an organ somewhere else in our bodies, and it was not connected perfectly, then we would not be around. I just wish I were half the designer Jesus is.
