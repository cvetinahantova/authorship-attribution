Last night Rich rented  urlLink The Station Agent  a study in trains and boredom. OK, it wasn't that bad, but I don't think trainspotting is a very interesting hobby.  When I was pregnant we were channel surfing and I changed the channel off of some shark thing Rich was watching. Then I stopped on some restoration drama starring (of course) Colin Firth. Rich said, "When we have the baby there will be more sharks and less Colin Firth around here."  Last night he said: "Did you like it better than a shark movie?"  "Yes"  "Did you not like it as much as a Colin Firth movie?"  "Yes"  "In that case, it was the perfect compromise. Right?"  Tee hee.. my husband is so funny. I want a divorce!!
