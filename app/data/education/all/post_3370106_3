My fear is tangible, causing me to question, looking for cracks in the foundation, formulating "what if's" endlessly, rotating incomprehensible scenarios for the sole purpose of meltdown, at least, meltdown was my usual path.  Thoughts should lead to action, or is it action that leads to thought.  I must meditate on that.  Either way, with my thinking, it's best that I act out of my true desire to seek an understanding of God, an understanding of the natural flow of spiritual forces.  I will be asking for guides and for understanding until there comes a point where I must guide and provide some help and still I will ask for guidance and for deeper atunement.  This practice must never end, because that would be turning my back on the source of joy.    If I sense nothing more, may I sense the presence my personal life-force which stems from the ultimate consciousness, the ultimate love and acceptance, and into this embrace may I forever dance and rejoice.  When the time comes, let nothing stand in my way as I pass into the next phase, as I assemble the courage to manifest divine will as handed down through ages.  May I recieve the touch of light from which I have already gained so many blessing.  Divine Mother, I thank you and hold dear the kiss of your redemption.
