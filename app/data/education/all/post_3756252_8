I must apologize to William Mulholland and his family for wrongfully linking him with the likes of Fred Eaton.  Eaton was a weasel who profited immensely and criminally by passing himself off as a federal official (which I thought was a crime, but I guess not).    Mulholland, who was Eaton's partner, did not profit from the aqueduct in any way other than his government salary.  In fact, William Mulholland was, at best, a bona fide genius and, at worst, an engineering geek.  He was famous at parties for his ability to commit to memory the entirety of the Los Angeles water works system.  If asked, he could tell you the exact size, width, and length of any pipe under any street in Los Angeles.    And yet, even greater than that accomplishment, he engineered the aqueduct--the longest of its kind at the time--and got it done on time and under budget.  Finally, and the primary reason for this retraction, William Mulholland, was a bit of a tragic hero.  In 1928, one of the dams he built, the St. Francis Dam near Piru, burst.  Sending water, debris, and thousand pound chunks of cement tumbling through the Santa Clara valley and towards the Pacific Ocean, over 50 miles from the dam.  Five hundred people died.  Everyone, including the man himself, blamed Mulholland for the tragedy.  He died believing he was responsible.    In 1992, a geological survey team determined that the dam broke for reasons beyond Mulholland's control (something about an ancient landslide or something like that).  So, I write all this so that William Mulholland's name not be besmirched again by being linked unkindly to a money-grubbing, amoral, puss-bucket like Fred Eaton.
