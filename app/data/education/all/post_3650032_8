Badminton indoors with no aircon @ 30+ degrees. Despite being loads of fun (especially when you play with two shuttles at one time), you are sure to end up totally drenched after an hour of play.  Recently, I biked to the onsens in Onogawa as Andrew lead the way (an onsen is a natural hot pool). For someone in better shape, the ride there and back wouldn't have been so bad, but at this stage even marginal inclines are a killer on my body. The onsen we went to was quite nice, although we cut it rather fine when it came time for the change over (when the male only pool switches to become the female only pool and vice versa). Apparently the sight of two gaijin in moderate states of undress was enough to ruin one old lady's day, and she slammed the door behind us as we left.  This sort of moodiness is all the more disturbing in Japan because it is so rare. Ho hum.
