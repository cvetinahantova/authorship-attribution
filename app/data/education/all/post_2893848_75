A Master of Dungeons                          By IJ  I received a sackful of angry email for assuming that  urlLink this guy  is a dungeon master.  "How insensitive of you," you people wrote "to assume that just because he is overweight, bearded, and in a purple and teal striped shirt, that he is a dungeon master."  Well, it looks like the hunters have become the hunted here folks.  I didn't assume anything this fellow didn't advertise.   Not only is this dude a DM, he's been doing it since 1982, presiding over the  urlLink Company of the Righteous Fist .    Those are some badass motherfuckers.  Consider  urlLink Cethorlyn .  While his wisdom may be "dubious," his strength is "mythical," his dexterity the stuff of legend.  Sometimes I wish I had stuck with roleplaying games.  The moral clarity is so attractive.  That, and the fact that you can objectively evaluate yourself on a fixed scale.  Even Cethorlyn knows his own limitations.  Imagine living a life based on an honest and accurate understanding of your abilities.  We'd all find ways to be heroic, or at least, justify our own suicides.
