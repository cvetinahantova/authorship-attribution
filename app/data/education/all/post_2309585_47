Happy birthday to meeeeee! :) Not a bad birthday, really. Steph, thanks for the dinner and cheesecake Saturday night. And thanks, everybody for the e-cards and emails!  Andy took yesterday off, and we slept in and ate doughnuts and watched movies. It was great. I got a card from Tina with a letter and a couple of pictures that Trenton drew for his Aunt Heather. Awww!  As for today, a midterm test, rehearsals for 2 shows, and getting tags for our car. Whee. Can I party or what?
