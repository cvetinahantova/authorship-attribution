Yeah! I made it on here!  Who is Big T?   This will be a more of a "how i'm doing on my weightloss" than a what I ate today (I already so this somewhere else, I guess I could copy and paste!)  Anyone interested in Joining me on the Walk for the Cure in October to end Breast Cancer?  I'll be R U N N I N G (as much as I can) in the 5k, but you can walk/rollerblade/electric slide with me!  Fun group activity that raises awareness for a scary disease!  I'm here! C
