I had half a day annual leave yesterday to attend a meeting in Stafford about computer strategies. Following that I went straight to football practise, then once home, it was time for tea and housegroup. Busy, busy, busy.  By 22:00, I was totally shattered and went to bed looking forward to getting loads of sleep. How wrong I was - another night of disturbed sleep. It's not because I'm lying awake thinking about things though. I just can't sleep. I'm sure it's to do with the medication, but the doctor won't give me anything at this stage, preferring to get me to exercise. The theory is all well and good, but today I am totally shattered and can't concentrate on my work at all....Oh well!
