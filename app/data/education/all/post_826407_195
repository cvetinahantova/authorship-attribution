urlLink the next generation of theologians will start as bloggers  is manifesto for aspiring theoblogian's from  urlLink Dan Hughes .   urlLink   Steve Taylor  responds with a thoughtful note of caution  urlLink here   I see myself as an un-theologian who likes to indulge in talking and thinking about God.  Blogging has profoundly changed the way I do that.  It has put me in contact with conversations that involve trained theologians as well as people committed to living out their faith and finding answers along the way (I'm not suggesting that theologians may not do that by the way).    I have had a suspicion for a long time that "good" theology is shaped by the experience of our walk and in particular by our acts of mission.  As such when we get together and talk we don't pool our ignorance but rather share our stories of what God might be doing.    Maybe the next generation of theologians won't just be bloggers.  But I hope they will be story tellers committed to conversation.
