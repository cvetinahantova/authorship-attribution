WOW!  I had no idea that teachers, students, and administrators had so many standards in technology.  I knew we were supposed to be receiving 6 hours of technology training each year, but is that truly sufficient to meet these high standards?  I doubt it.  For example, teachers being able to "demonstrate introductory knowledge, skills, and understanding of concepts related to technology" is a tough task for some experienced teachers.  They need adequate hands-on training to be able to acheive these standards.  If our school district wants us to succeed as teachers, they will provide us the apporpriate and adequate training that is needed in order to acheive these standards.  Currently, technology in-service is scratching the surface of the introductory skill level.  Our in-services typically consist of 6 or 7 short 45 minute sessions on a particularly BASIC topic of technology.  I can only learn about how to hook up multimedia equipment so many times.  Personally, I am not afforded the opportunity to grow in my technology training at our district in-services.  They are basic and in need of overhauling.  Maybe that's where I can grow - by developing more adequate training for young teachers that need something to "push" the envelope a little.
