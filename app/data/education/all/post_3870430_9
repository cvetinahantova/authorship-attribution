(Hi all - we will be doing this in class, but if you want to get ahead of the eight ball - and let's be honest, most of you already are - this is the CHECKLIST. Use it.)  VITAL STUFF CHECKLIST:  I am signing off using my first name My full name is not displayed My blog accepts authorized comments only My blog does not use an underscore My blog is in the right time zone Zoe has my password  (Once you’ve got these, TELL ME and I’ll mark you off with a big tick).   THE VITAL STUFF: HOW TO DO IT…  To sign off with your first name… ·         Go to “dashboard” (from the top right of the screen) ·         Go to “edit profile” ·         Change “display name” to your real first name.  To not display your full name… ·         Still in “edit user profile”, uncheck the box marked “show my real name”  To accept authorized comments only… ·         Go to “settings” ·         Go to “comments” ·         Under “who can comment?” choose “only registered users” ·         Under “default for posts” choose “new posts have comments”  To get rid of your underscore… ·         Go to “settings” ·         Go to “publishing” ·         Change address to something using only letters and numbers  To get the right time zone… ·         Go to “settings” ·         Go to “formatting” ·         Scroll to “GMT 10: Australia/Melbourne”  To tell Zoe your password… ·         Go tell Zoe your password.
