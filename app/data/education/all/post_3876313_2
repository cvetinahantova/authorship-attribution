Wow!  One-fourth of the way done.  Amazing.  So just for the record, I haven't gained any weight, but Mark has gained 5 lbs.  Hee hee... But not to worry Mark, I am sure I will out gain you later.    The baby is two inches this week.  And is now reacting to the foods I eat.  I think it reacts to my sneezing too because my abdomen tenses and flutters.  It's cool.  I've never felt anything like it.
