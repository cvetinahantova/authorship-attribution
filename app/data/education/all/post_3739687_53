hello,  well yesterday i almost had to take a cell phone from a first grader.  i  couldn't believe it. i mean i've seen the older kids with them, but a first  grader!  she even had the nerve to make a call during the middle of my  class.  i wish i had of taken it from her because it was a really nice  mobile phone.  jk.  anyway...  things are going o.k. here.  i'm glad the  week is almost over.  i have a fairly easy day today so i'm just looking  forward to getting everything done.  this weekend i'm going to a party for a french girl named ermine.  she's  been here for one year and is now headed back to france.  i think she is  going to continue her studies there, but i'm not sure what she will be  studying.  anyway... lately i've spent a good bit of time with her and some  of the other french people.  also, i don't think they suck anymore.   acutually they are very cool once you get to know them.  i think the problem  at first was that their english is not that good so they might feel a little  intimidated when speaking it to me.  my french is even worse so they enjoy  teaching me things that i cannot say and laughing at my drawl when i do  attempt it.  well i've gotta run.  ya'll be good.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar Â get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/
