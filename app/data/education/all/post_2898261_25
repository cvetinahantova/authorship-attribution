Listening to: Silence Mood: Tired and insecure  Trust is a valuable thing in every relationship we have, it is also a  vunerable  thing. It sometimes takes time to build and others it can be almost instantaneous, but one thing is for sure: it only takes a minute to shatter. After all that I went through with SMR, trust is something I hold sacred and maybe that's why I'm strict on what I find acceptable and what isn't.   However, it is also something that with strength and perserverance can be "glued back together", but only if both parties are willing to fight for it. Something that was not the case with SMR.  However, this is  not  SMR or anything like that, therefore the willingness to fight to move forward is present and so is forgiveness.  I still want the same things and I still want them  yesterday , but now I wish it was last week instead of now... or maybe next month or next year... anything but now. Why? Because although it's strange to admit, all that happened just made me want those things even more, maybe because to me they represent stability and serenity or maybe because when you come close to losing something you hold onto it ever so dearly when the second time comes around. Right now what I want most in life isn't financial stability or a career or any of those materialistic statistics, I want ADMV living with me, I want to share a life with him and I want to be able to look at the   near   future and see marriage and children.  But right now, at this very moment, I would give anything to be with ADMV, anything at all.   HASTA
