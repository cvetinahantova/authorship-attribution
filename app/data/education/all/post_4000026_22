Finally I get to use the computer again. My dad was like messing around with the cable wires and all. Well at least now we don't have to move the cable wire around no more.lol. Anyway yesterday was weird. Missed church... went out with Jake and in the end we watched a movie. I-robot was awesome! Its like any normal detective kinda show but man was it really really cool. Ya guys can't miss out on it ya don't know what's ahead of ya. lol. Well today was good. We had three free periods and I ended up during some revision, which was good of course. Then went along with friends to have a chat. Well then came after school... english remedial. Lol our class are united! Well apparently the teacher was gonna go through some comprehension that other classes haven't seem to have done but our class did. So at first like 3/4 of the class just walked out of the hall leaving the teacher in "pissed mode". So the rest of us were reluctant to stay to but we just did. Within the next minute the teacher was like "Ya guys decide to stay or not go." So we immediately stood up and left.Lol it was so cooL!!! Then everyone else was just standing by the stairs and when they saw us they all cheered! It was so so cool. Anyway we all then headed home and now I'm gonna help my mum make some really delicious sugar sweet. Rock on guys!
