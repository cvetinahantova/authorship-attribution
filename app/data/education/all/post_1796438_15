The Final Week  School is only 1 week away... I honestly don't know whether to be excited or not about it. Just when you think the holidays are boring and there's nothing left to do, then thought of another 10 weeks only with new (and probably horrible) teachers grabs you from behind. Still, some good things will come out of school. Ie, my new calculator. The only problem is that with school on I won't be able to program. I've finally learnt how to make games, except I have to write the code on the computer then send the game over to the calc. That means that I can't sit around in class like I usully do working on some unrelated program (with the exception of maths where I sat making program for maths).   Henriette Arrives  The Danish girl,  Henriette, arrived in Esperance two days ago. She will be living with David. Various people (such as myself) do not believe that David is the wisest choice of person to be staying with. In fact it may promote the myth that Australia is a dangerous and hostile place. Oh well, there's a soccer game at 1pm tomorrow. A number of people are invited, and it will be an opportunity to meet her and inform her that not all people are as deadly as David.
