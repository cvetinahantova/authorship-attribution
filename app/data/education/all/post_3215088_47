Quite a good day for me today. Firstly, Innotrek confirmed that i am in for the next camp. Next, Ace Aventurer finally confirmed my "free" sportsclimbing lvl 1 course on sunday and i will be freelancing for them after the course....heehee....good catch cos the course cost ard 45-65 bucks and i am getting it for free with a chance to freelance in the future.  Lastly, friend intro me to F.I.T , another outdoor company opened by former national swimmer David Lim, and i will be doing a camp for them this coming Monday.     Sheares Hall sent me an email to inform me that i am free to check in to the hall from today onwards. Since i am still working in camps, i wont staying in hall for quite a number of days for the next 2 weeks thus i will only check in just before school reopens. Guessed wont be participating in their orientation but hopefully can join in the Rag and Flag. Really looking forward to hall life ( hmm.....a little like Stay In during army dayz) . Would have to start training my fitness and badminton now cos i appealed into Sheares as an "import" .....cannot malu myself.  Gtg now....camp briefing in 4 hrs time..... Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
