MY BIRTHDAY!!!!       Well, I am now 23...it really is one of those ages that amounts to absolutely nothing.  Anyway, I was very fortunate that my birthday fell on a Wednesday because that meant I got to celebrate my birthday at the boys school.  While I had absolutely nothing to do, I am incredibly happy just being there and was therefore definitely glad it was a 'visit school' day.    As far as the festivities, I went to a cozy little ramen shop with some of my closer friends here in Japan.  Over ramen and gyoza they tried to make a big deal out of my birthday (as they started doing in Okinawa) and continually reminded me of the quality of friends I have made here.  My birthday dinner was definitely a fun night out with the girls!    Oh yea, so I am used to St. Paddy`s Day being a big deal back in the U.S. and even when I was in Australia.  When all of my friends showed up at dinner and only one happened to be wearing green by mistake I was forced to give them a bit of a hard time.  It was then they all chimed in that they only know of March 17th as my birthday and the idea of it being a special day for some other reason never even crossed their minds.  How could I argue with that?!?!?!?
