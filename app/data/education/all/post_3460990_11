When I turned on my computer at work this morning and opened Internet Explorer, it went directly, as always, to the MSN page.   One of their front page articles was entitled, "Flip Flops at the Office!?" with the subtitle. "What NOT to wear to work."  I think this is funny because I am, right now, blogging in flip-flops.   Hahahahaha. I have 4 days left. Whaydda they gonna do, fire me?
