Well folks, with more help from  urlLink Computing and Networking  services at the UW, I was able to fix the permission problem regarding the  urlLink pictures  of me and the beard I grew during the  urlLink Counting of the Omer .    But the reply I got regarding the scrolling is still unclear, so I’m getting more back from them on that matter.   Justin and  urlLink Dave  were in town, which was great. I wasn’t able to spend as much time with them as I would have liked since I was working, and since the Grand Opening of Hillel was this past Sunday. They are on their way to LA and from there off for a month’s adventure in Thailand.   So many other things to write about, but for the moment, I’ll leave you all woefully uninformed.
