I just went jogging, and my god do I feel out of shape now...  My back hurts really bad for whatever reason... probably because I haven't slept yet. I didn't really run very far... I only made it about half way around the block before I had to walk, but then I started running after I made it to the top of the hill. So, I guess I jogged about two thirds of it. Anyway, now that I hurt, I'm going to go back to whatever I was doing before I left.    Current Music: The Cure - Just Like Heaven
