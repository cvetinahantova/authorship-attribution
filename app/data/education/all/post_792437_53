Mmmm...    Â  Why don't teachers sit down and work it out that they don't give so many tests during the same week, or close to each other? Yah, it's totally not fair! I study study study...acck, nothing but study. I had a biochemistry test friday, now monday is an immunology test...do I get time for a break?? nah...Oh well..I'm just complaining...figures that if I didn't study, I'd be wishing I had something to do....I suppose I'll get back to my studying..
