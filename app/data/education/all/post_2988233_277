I have to say last night was the best date night we have ever had.    We went to Applebee's to eat (I had never been) and of course it was wonderful.  And, a touch romantic.  LEsson for you readers from the male persuasion:  Tommy sat on the same side of the booth as me, (aaawwwwww) we sat and did the touchy feely thing, my arm around him, at one point he got my hand and kissed it. It was sooooo nice.   When we left, outside the restaurant, he kissd me!  WHAT a PDA from my HUSBAND???????  NO, those things don't happen after you have been married for almost 16 years.  But Yes, my husband kissed me in a public place!  I was shocked, amazed and thrilled.  We had to make a payment for my mom , so we went to walmart, where, he held my hand.  count em ladies, that is 2, two, dose, PDA's in one night!  WhooHooo.  Walked around for a bit.  Which in itself is a miracle, Tommy hates shopping of any sort, really hates it.    Drove around for a while, then went home early to get the boys, I dropped him off at he house before going to Renee's to get them, and he got me by the hand, took me over to a quiet place in the driveway, and we made out like teenagers!  Oh to be young again.    It was a good night, a very good night.
