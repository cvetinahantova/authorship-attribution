Wonder Still Manifests  in an involved street of mobile faces making their way to pedestrian destinations everything blended into a sidewalk cacophony  the patterns parted and you were set free  and approaching  our eyes locked for an eternal instant I could not breathe and I could not look away  what biographies did our minds create for each other in seconds I saw long deep nights of quiet conversations where topics don't retreat and there is comfort in closeness  the nearer we stepped  into sensual proximity our eyes widened knowing something special was taking place between us all I am left with for my part in the mystery was an enchanting smile and a fading echo of essence  we passed each other by and I did not turn for fear  that I would not see you there you are tangible and real in my day's gratitude for reminding me that  wonder still manifests  when I least expect it  Â©2003 DC Vision
