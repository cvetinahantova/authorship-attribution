Wine  OK, taking a bit of a break at 11:20pm, and drinking a glass of merlot.  The battle is going very well.  I am enjoying the analysis of the various fragments of Heraclitus, and trying to put all the pieces together into something coherrent.  Everytime I go through the fragments, I find some new, subtle connection to another area of the fragments, and to my own life.  That is the good news.  The somewhat mediocre news is that it is taking me longer than I anticipated.  I probably won't be finished until 2:00am, at the earliest, and that is not including a read-through for grammar and writing a bibliography, which will include about a dozen books about Heraclitus.  I've never done so much outside research for a single paper before.  That is also good, as one should always be striving to accomplish more than one accomplished in the past, otherwise, you don't grow.  Growing is painful; another example of strife manifested in an obstacle that must be overcome.  I also realized that I still need to write two articles for the Northern Student's April fool's edition.  Another thing I remembered was that I was supposed to work from 8 to 10 tomorrow morning, but my friend Tessa was willing to pick those hours up for me.
