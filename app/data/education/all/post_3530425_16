I hear this can be addictive.  This public posting of our inner lives,360 degree exposure of our souls' hearts to anyone voyeuristic to want to drop by.  For me, I think this will be where I tell my darkest thoughts--those too sad to tell to anyone else.  The thoughts I would hate to admit even to my therapist.  Those too beastly for my best friend.  An introduction seems in order.  Newly divorced, and already dumped by the so-called "transitional guy."  Transition to what, I'd like to know?  Where am I supposed to be headed? The therapist says no more men, and the best friend agrees.  Similar opinions from locales as divergent as Cincinnati and Wilmington, Delaware.  But maybe transition guy was (could be, my ever-hoping heart insists) the love I've been hoping for.  But then, I thought the ex was that man, for about one minute, before I was swept into marrying someone I knew was wrong for me, because he insisted that I couldn't survive without him.  And looking at how things are going right now, maybe I can't.  I don't like the ex, let alone love him, but maybe this being independant of him isn't all it's cracked up to be.  But back to transitional guy, who has all the usual features we ascribe to unrequited love: looks, sex appeal, personality, and so on.  What I think happened, is that I'm just not special enough. OK to screw, competent at conversation, as long as it's fueled by booze and/or pot, and the promise of sweaty sex within the hour. And, before the ex, that describes my attractiveness quotient to all the other lovers:  convenient, easy on the eyes, willing...but just that.  I'm just not special enough to merit even interest, let alone love, from someone I'd be willing to hook up with.  Wasn't it Groucho Marx who said he'd never join any club that would have him as a member?  Me to a "t".
