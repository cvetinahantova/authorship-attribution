This ADHD thing is getting me down, and screwing me around. Things are starting to fall apart at the seams. I'm worried. I just can't seem to do what I should do. Maybe I'm just weak willed. Maybe I need God's help. Maybe I just don't know. Well in the mean time it's time for excercise to counteract the effects of my medication...  Wish me luck.
