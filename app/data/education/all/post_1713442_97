urlLink Instruction Clearninghouse (OhioLINK/ALAO)  This is a nice collection of library instruction resources maintained by the Academic Library Association of Ohio.  While it has not been updated in a year, most of the material presented still looks valuable.  Resources include training scripts (lesson plans), handouts, tutorials, database handouts, pathfinders, and links to class pages and mission statements for information literacy.  Many the resources are available in both Word or PDF downloads.  Even if you are not using the same databases, these tools are helpful in that they can give you ideas for lessons or handouts.  And if you are using some of the same resources, your work is almost done.  This is a good site and I hope ALAO continues to maintain and update it.
