This page is devoted to the 30th president of the United States, Calvin Coolidge.  President Coolidge was not the most exciting president in our nation's history.  During his presidency there were no affairs with interns, re-counts, impeachment trials, wars, recessions, troubles with Florida voters, etc.  His presidency was one a proud one.  He is one of few presidents that made the country better after he left then when he arrived in office, except the Great Depression which he was not responsible for.  He was an honest man, from a small town, who possessed great morals.  He might not have been the greatest nor is he well-known in our nation's history, but he is a man of integrity that we shall all be proud of and we should all be grateful for his duty in the Oval Office.
