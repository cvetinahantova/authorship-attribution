I know Mel Dobberteen from high school.  Mel was bet 10 bucks to run head first into his car and make a dent.  He did it.  Mel crashed a motorcycle into a ditch and walked away.  He jumped out of a speedboat going 35MPH and got a concussion.  Mel was a boxer.  One time after losing a fight, he went into Burger King.  He ordered �5 cheeseburgers, no pickles.�  When the burgers came back, he bit into one, and guess what, he tasted a pickle.  Well, Mel was keyed up from losing and he went back to the counter and said, �I want 5 f-ing cheese burgers without f-ing pickles!�  He got them back and, pickles.  He went off.  He threw the cheeseburgers behind the counter and dropped many atomic f-bombs.  A policeman was there and warned Melvin and he would be cited for public obsenity.  Mel told him that he would �F-ing kill him.�  When we played basketball together Mel also told the ref that he would �f-ing kill him.�  Mel was thrown in jail for running over a gas station pump with his truck and also for shooting a truck with a potato gun.  This is only a part of the legend of Melvin.  I've told a bunch of people about the exploits of my friend Melvin.  Well, I found some pictures of him.  Here they are.  Scary.   urlLink The War in Iraq: April 7, 2003       US marine Melvin Dobberteen keeps watch on two suspected Fedayeen fighters in Nasiriyah.
