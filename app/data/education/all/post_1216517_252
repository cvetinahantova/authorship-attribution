this is dmh.  my eye hurts.  i dont think i want to go home.  frank and i would like to move to spain.  i vote for all the not married people to become expats with us.  all the married people/soon to be married people/and jesse and robyn are invited to visit us on holiday whenever you wish. frank and i threw a stick back and forth the other day trying to hit each other.  it was great fun.  and i touched a shark today.  i am going to go cozy up with a rum punch, my new fav drink.  peace.
