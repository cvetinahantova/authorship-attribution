I'm a "metal head" now... lol, well, I just got my eyebrow pierced today. It didn't really hurt, and 3.5 hours later, it still doesn't. It looks great too. I love it. I hope it doesn't get rejected. Â  I haven't had much time on the computer these past days, and on Thursday morning I'll be going camping for at least four days. I should be back on the computer a lot again afterwards, because I'll have nothing else to do really. I'm sick right now though, so I'm going to sleep. G'night.
