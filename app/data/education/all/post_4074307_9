Well, I'm feeling a little under the weather today, so I thought I would take a few minutes to post a book review, since I haven't been paying attention to today's events.   Reading is one of the many gifts my late Mom gave me.  She did everything she could to get me to read and I just wouldn't do it until she gave me Casino Royal by Ian Flemming.  From there I read every Flemming Bond book I could get a hold of and have branched out from there.  Lately, I've gotten into political books (suprise suprise!!!!)  and historical/ historical fiction.  I've even added a small bookcase to hold all of the books I have on "My Pile" to read.  Today I want to actually talk about two books by Herman Wouk called "The Hope" and "The Glory."   The books trace several families from the creation of Israel through to almost the present day.   It took me no time at all to get through these books, with Wouk's prose making it feel as though I was living next door to the families in the story.  Anyone who  reads these books will understand the trials and tribulations Israeli's face every day and have a new respect for the country that is home to the  some of the most important archeological sites in the modern world1
