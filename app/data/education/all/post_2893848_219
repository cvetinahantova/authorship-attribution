Reluctantly Forsaking Johnny Christ   The most  urlLink recent rumor on SOSH  is that the Sox could trade Kim and Damon for Carlos Beltran, Baseball's "next" big thing in a three-way trade involving Seattle's Freddy Garcia.  Certainly, this is exciting.  As much as I hate to  urlLink forsake the christ , the numbers are clear.  (My girlfriend, never convinced by numbers, was quite upset when I told of this rumor.  She was against Nomar/Manny for Mags/A-Rod too.  She doesn't care if the sox win, just that they be sexy and have personality.)  To my understanding, losing Kim and Damon's contracts (assuming they are taken in full, a big assumption) makes room for much of the money that it would take to lock up Beltran this winter.    This looks pretty good.  My only question is how it affects negotiations with Nomar.  There's talk that the Yankees  urlLink might put Boone at second base  as soon as this summer, so perhaps that affects Nomar's options to our team's benefit.  But I've got to wonder if that rumor of Nomar going to the Yankees was paranoid delusion in the first place.  I'm more worried about the Dodgers or, worse, the Angels.  The upside, at least, is that we'd have both through this season, which would cement an overlording line up.  And after that, Beltran would be the guy to stick with.  The two put up eerily comparable offensive numbers in 2003, but it's fair to assume that, given their relative ages, Nomar will decline while Beltran gets better.  And there's nothing to say that management doesn't plan to get a heavier bat on second base if Nomar leaves (Vidro?)   Reel him in, Theo.
