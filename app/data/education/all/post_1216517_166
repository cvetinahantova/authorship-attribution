I am the King Midas of laundry.  I have so many clean socks and underwear now.  I feel so luxurious with the variety I have now in selections.  "hmm, should I go with the plain black boxers, or the cat in the hat ones, or the taz ones, or how about some red boxer briefs."  Shoot.  I feel like a millionaire.   Black socks, brown socks, green socks.  It's amazing.
