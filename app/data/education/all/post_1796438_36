It's your turn to be a contestant on the Price is Right!  Fine, it may not be The Price is Right but this is still a damn good website. Teagan hasn't checked her emails yet (or so she tells me) so she isn't a member yet. But dear Hera is. Here's some of the conversation for all you people who wanna know how it really went down.  Hayden: do you want me to make you an account so you can post there too? Hera: no thanks Hayden: are you sure? Hera: yeah Hayden: it's easy Hera: no really thanks anyways Hayden: i really want to make an account for you Hayden: (its already half done) Hera: noooooooooooo Hera: im a boring person Hayden: you dont have to post Hayden: it just might come in handy one day Hera: ok ok  In other news Christy is now renting a house in Glendalough. It's like $200 a week. I'm still secretly hoping she buys a house in or around Cannington.
