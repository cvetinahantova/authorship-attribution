Why am I awake?  How am I awake?  Well the answer to the first question is to send an e-mail to my boss explaining why I totally fucking blew off work this morning.  I think I'm getting to the point of just not caring.  I was supposed to work this Sunday morning to make up for the day I'm taking to go to Saipan.  But nobody ever told me when to show up so I didn't show up.  I went home unplugged the phone and slept like a log.  The hell if I'm going to show up only to find out they don't need me.  The can get their asses organized.  Today was great.  Best Sunday I've had in longer then I can remember.  I hung out with Hey-sook all day.  It is cool we can still be friends and kick it.  All of this was topped off by a victory in Risk tonight.  I'll figure out what happened on Fri. and Sat. some other time.  If I can move tomorrow there is free beer at Miller Time.  I think this is a good thing.   I'm going to bed.
