Summer is here!  Ahh, yes! It is the season for Country Time Lemonade commercials (speaking of which; where are they?), grilling, dressing less, and children playing in sprinklers.  I love being a teacher mainly for the summer breaks.  It makes 9 months of devilish torture and evil manifesting itself in children worthwhile!  I have nothing meaningful to say today or anyday.  I'm just acknowledging how wonderful the education system is in the United States.  Teachers and students alike look forward to summer breaks, and during the school year the only real ones learning are the teachers.  Students lag behind previous generations and prepare for a lifetime of minimum wage and dysfunctional home lives.   You've got to respect and appreciate our education system today!
