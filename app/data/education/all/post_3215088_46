1 word NUMB!!!!!!!!  Had my level 1 sports climbing course today. A very good course and had very good instructors. Really enhanced my knowledge about the equipment and practice used in climbing. Not bad today considering the last time i tried climbing is 6-7 yrs ago. Today i  cleared the first wall which was a flat wall. Failed on the second wall though which was one with more contour and some overhang. Tried the wall twice and managed to clear 2 overhangs before i slipped on the way up. After this wall, my hands go totally NUMB!!! Got my level 1 sports climbing certification at the end of the day. I find climbing quite fun too......shd be climbing more often from now on. By the way, today we climbed without helmets....hmm...feels so light...not like the MOE campsites where helmets is compulsory....hahahaha........  My hands were so JIALAT that i have problems holding the clutch on my dad's bike. Super numb and pain. Tomolo got camp....i think i going to be chao slacker tomolo liao ....wish me good luck!!    Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
