I awoke one season in life to find that my feet were shackled together and my back was laden with a burden heavy beyond imagining.   My mind raced.  Why was I burdened and bound?  Why this load?  How long could I endure?  There must be some means of relief.  So in a feeble search for a solution, I set off; but as soon as I tried to move, the all-too-obvious answer presented itself.   I fell to my knees.   Oddly enough, my hands were bound together as well.
