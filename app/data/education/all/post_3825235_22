Yeah, so our reunion...need I say more? When people come from out of town, one of the first places they want to go is White Sands (at least in our family it is), so we spent an evening there during the reunion. It was so fun! We had dinner, jumping competitions, quizzes for the newbies in the family, sliding races, a drum serenade, and building contests (well, sort of). Dabbie had wanted to go back for a while, so she was looking forward to it, and had a BLAST! She even was sliding down the "mountain" all by herself. (Don't tell my mom...oh, wait, she gets on here. Oh, well. :))  'Twas a lot of fun, and can't wait to go back, but it's more fun if it's not just two of you. However, I can find people to go with us, the question is, do I want to take the time? Eh, sure...but I will let you know.  Dabbie's favorite part of our time at White Sands!Â  urlLink     urlLink     I am trying to plan a camping trip for us sometime soon. I think she would really like it, and we need things to do to get her out of the house on the weekends, because I work pretty much all day long during the week. (During Summer 2, which begins on Tuesday, I work 7-2...OUCH) If you have any ideas of things we could do, please let me know.
