My Earth Friends   My oak friends, the tall trees emit the oxygen, are aging I, as a breather of life, always am forever appreciated My pine friends offer the nutritious world engaging And for I embrace the life, not for I to be depreciated My palm friends breeze the balmy, tropical smell I, as a Pacific Islander, know what's the Earth tongue My gardenia friends' potent perfume can bind the spell And for I love the strong aroma, for I stay to be young My lilac friends blur, burn, and color my eyes all purple I, as a resident of Earth, harvest the good energy My fruit-bearing friends offer foods, and i crave for apple And for I grasp the meaning of it, and I am for forestry My prolific friends; I commend thee for the love, and I greet Thee with my love, and for us to make our life more sweet   ~Kekua May 2004
