As I went to the supermarket today I came across an old Amstrad computer monitor lying broken on the floor.  It looked almost organic, like some strange dead animal.    It hadn�t had a peaceful death.  The screen was smashed and it�s cable lay beside it; as though it was been reaching out for something to grasp on to.  Perhaps it had been tortured by the kind of people that pull wings off flies, or maybe it was thrown from the wall above in a parody of the famous rock-n-roll clich�.  Strangely it looked as though it had been re-arranged after its crash, the glass from the screen was in a pile by it and the monitor was face up and looked too awkward to have just landed there.  Maybe a computer funeral director had come to re-arrange the corpse and make it more palatable to passers by.  Others noticed this too.  As I was looking an elderly man walked past and asked:   �Is that modern art then?�    Perhaps it was.    It was a sad scene, enhanced by the wet weather.  But it was also kind of beautiful.  The glass and metal shimmered and sparkled and I was glad to have discovered it.    I went home to get my camera and took some photos. If they�re any good I�ll put them up here.  The monitor made me think of the things we humans do with objects, feelings and relationships that we consider obsolete�and it made me glad I wasn�t a computer monitor.
