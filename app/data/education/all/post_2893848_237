How does  urlLink Freddy Garcia going to the White Sox  affect who I will root for after I move to Chicago?  It's hard to say.  On the one hand, I kind of like Garcia.  He's a Derek Lowe-when-he's-good type of pitcher, even to the extent of being a bit of a nut.  This is my favorite sort of player, sort of a lovable loser, lovable because he helps your team win but is, you know, kind of a loser.  This kind of player is quintessentially Red Sox and his presence on the White Sox may make them more the kind of team I want to root for.  On the other hand, he should be on the Red Sox.  There was good reason to think Theo was after him and that Chicago got him for Kelly Shoppach's long lost hispanic twin, only makes me more mad.  So maybe this is a strike against the White Sox, in favor of the Cubs.  Bitches be stabbing you in the back.
