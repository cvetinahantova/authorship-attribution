Almost everyone that sees me eat lunch at school asks about it.  It is always a salad.  They tend to be fairly magnificent creations.  To date, I have received one marriage proposal, numerous orders and an offer to become someone's chef for life.  I make each salad fresh each morning.  Preparing the dish usually requires about 1/2 hour.  Here are the ingredients of the salad that I made Thursday morning:  A Generous Amount of Red Leaf Lettuce,  Modest Amounts of the following:  Fresh corn cut from the cob Fresh Blackberries Fresh Raspberries Diced Red Peppers Chopped Broccoli Diced Baby Carrots Chopped Dried Apricots Dried Cranberries Chopped Green Onion Tomato quarters Diced Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese Diced Fresh Peaches Diced Fresh Pluots (Plum/Apricot cross, wonderful!) Diced Cucumbers Chopped Cabbage Chopped Green Snap Beans About 1/2 cup of diced Honey Ham Sliced Mushrooms Chopped Pecans Diced Golden Kiwi Fruit Diced Apple Diced Green Olives stuffed with Jalapeno Diced Pepper Jack Cheese  All topped with a modest amount of Poppyseed Dressing  This usually takes me about 20-30 minutes to eat.  I did not have time to get my whole salad eaten today and had to bring some of it home.  Depending upon what is available, I might also add Strawberries, Blueberries, Pears, Hardboiled Eggs, Turkey, Tuna, Raisins, Black Olives or any other fruit or vegetable laying around.  In case anyone is wondering, I have almost the exact same thing for breakfast each morning, leaving out the meat and vegetables.  I put any fruit and nut available into a bowl with one Shredded Wheat biscuit and about 1/2 cup of Wheaties or Bran Flakes (whichever is on sale.)  I get lots of fruit servings each day!
