In the storm literally....    Â  This weekend my family went to West Lafayette..and also to Chicago to just buy a lot of stuff. My mom bought a lot, as she's the shopaholic...We went to look for a place for me to live in when I attend graduate school this fall.  Err, the whole time we were there it rained..well actually on the way back it rained. My friend had told me that I was in the storm while my friend was the one looking from outside the storm. I never got it till today. I was in the storm and practically drove about 4 hours in it (I drove a bit-in chicago to middle of Wisconsin)...I guess getting out of the storm was like me learning from it. Interesting...
