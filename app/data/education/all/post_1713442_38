urlLink CMU Libraries -- LIB 197   Well, I taught my first class for my LIB 197 course.  I have 25 students.  Much to my surprise, most of them are upperclassmen.  I think they are looking for an easy class.  I probably will deliver.  I will make them work but it is only a one credit hour class and it is about research, not rocket science.  I stressed attendance and doing the work.  I also used the Cardiff Giant story which I blogged last week.  It did grab their attention.  I opened with it.  I closed with an ice breaker where I had them come up with social issues in their neighbothoods and how library research can help them in solving the problems.  All in all, a good first class.
