Hi 8S!  This is the first post on this blog. You'll notice that the oldest posts go to the bottom, and the newest ones at the top.   This blog has a couple of purposes:  1) This is where I keep track of everyone's work. You can find everyone's blogs linked from here.  2) This isÂ where I will post trouble-shooting guides 3) This is where I will post comments on the progress of the whole classes blogs, and on how the project is going in general.  If you have questions - post them in the comments box and I'll read them there.  Cheers, and enjoy!
