Leaps and bounds over emerald hillsides, Drinking summertime's wine; Oh the days of cerulean heavens, Up, up and alive; Strings are loosed - imagination wings away... Taste a cloud - and savor it another day...   Like a word that is whispered upon the breeze, Free, innocent child; Swept away from the halcyon yesterdays To a world without smile; Peace is gone - tomorrow haunts us as we dream... Self-made man - imprisoned by the things that seem...   Unsure and afraid in this temple of clay, As shackles of frailty bind; Great master of hillsides and all that's to come, I beg You renew my mind;   God of Creation - Possesor of Omnipotence; This hesitation I relinquish to Your Imminence; And I'm coming again like a child To the God of Creation.
