Weekend over, homework done and dusted and another successful gig. Went to London with Guides yesterday- had to get up at the ridiculously early hour of 7.30 in the morning so I could be at the coach for 8.45. I didn't even know that 7.30 existed on a Saturday! I thought it just... wasn't there! Got to London and went on the London Eye, which was very nice and immediately forgettable. Then headed to Wembley Arena for the "Big Gig"- 10,000 screaming girls(not one boy- gutted, hehehe), a bunch of fairly well known-ish pop stars and Fearne Cotton from CBBC. It was all fairly boring, the Cheeky Girls being the main highlight, until......   MARK OWEN CAME ON!!  Mark bloody Owen! I had no idea he was on and I was soooo impressed. I started going on about how he was my favourite member of Take That, but none of the people I was with had heard of them... felt so old. Boo Hiss. ButButBut! All was not lost when  LIBERTY X  arrived and were just  Great . They finished their set with Just A Little  (SEXXXYYYY)  and I then immediately went to the toilet to ring Selina and tell her allll about it, while Atomic Kitten were on. Then had to survive a 3hour journey home in between a bunch of hyperactive 12 year-olds and 3 miserable teenagers who kept telling them to shut up. Do they not understand how much I  need  my sleep?? Gah.  Another achievement of Saturday was the acquisition of DRAPER's number from Coz. Texted him, flirted a bit, got a reply: No flirt. Alas. Replied, flirted a bit more... No reply so far. Dammit.  Ceff x   And you're so innocent, please don't take it wrong cos it's a compliment...
