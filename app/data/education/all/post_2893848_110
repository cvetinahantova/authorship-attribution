Sorry I didn't post yesterday.  I had an ER visit on Wednesday night that turned out to be not such a big deal, but I was there until 3 AM.  Those fuckers really like to scare you; I thought I was in dire straits until I talked to my own doctor yesterday and cleared things up.   It looks like I'm okay, but please understand that considering one's own mortality is not great inspiration for a blog post, at least not at the time.          So: I'm not going to die anytime soon.  Barring runaway buses, random acts of violence, vendettas, bounties or grudges I am unaware of; stray toasters over prone bathtubs; rabid dogs, hungry zoo animals; skiing accidents; car accidents; wildly irresponsibly drug use; landing on the wrong side of a kitchen knife; a freak blow to the temple; et cetera.  Barring all these things and more I cannot name, I will not be dying any time soon.  I'll post something less personal a little later.
