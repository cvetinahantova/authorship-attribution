A Reflection following the poor person prayer from Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World) Midrash on the Haggadah  By Rabbi David Seidenberg   "How do we raise our own voices? By protesting poverty and injustice. How do we do teshuvah? By responding to the voices that call out to us, by changing how we live. Only when we answer each other's needs do our own prayers become precious. Only then does our bread become "lechem oni/the bread of answering."   My reaction... What I really like about this time of of the jewish year is the Seder dinner.  Its focus on justice and liberation is empowering.    The needs of the poor are questions to be answered by us.  We can do Teshuvah  or repentance by changing our local ordances to allow more of our community members to join the ranks of living sustaninable wages.  It is a first step in creating a memphis where all people who work receive a living wage.   allan
