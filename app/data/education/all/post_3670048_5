Well this whole thing is nothing but a personal note, but oh well.  I wish I knew if people were reading this thing, though I'm sure they don't. Anywho it's a good place to vent and record my thoughts anyways.   Last week I started Weight Watchers.  This marks my third time on the program, but the first time that I actually WANT to do it.  I went on it high school, cause my dad and stepmonster were going on it and because Sandee wasn't cooking, she still doesn't cook, I was forced to eat their food (back in the day when they had tv dinners).  I did lose some weight then.  I have always been big, not grotesque, at least I don't think I'm that ugly, but I am big.  I always will be. My father is huge (even a year and a half after his gastric bypass) my mother on the other hand has never weighed more than 112 lbs.  Oh to be cursed with no thyroid. I am trying this. I know I need to do something.  I just hate to realize that people are really that shallow and the only way I will get a boyfriend is if I'm skinny.  Are people really that shallow? Each day I lose more and more faith in the human race.
