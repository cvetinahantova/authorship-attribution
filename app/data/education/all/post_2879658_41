Okay, so this is not what you are thinking...this past Saturday I went to a soccer practice and was offered a ride to the field (about an hour north in Tajiri) by Dave.  Naturally, Dave arrived a bit late with Robin in the front seat. The two of them together are definitely good for a bunch of laughs.  The ride home was definitely quite a fun disaster of a trip.  Rob, another Shiogama resident, joined us for the return trip.  Dave decided that there had to be a shorter route home than the one we took to Tajiri.  Unfortunately, we were in the inaka (rural japan) and were seemingly driving in circles in the middle of rice fields.  We stopped to check the map, stopped to ask directions a few times, and basically did everything imaginable to try and find a particular road.  Robin was throwing raisins at Dave's head claiming that whatever way the raisins bounced off was the direction we should head.  Rob claimed that Dave and Robins maturity level drops about 10 years when they are together and Robin countered that by saying that Robs increases by about 20 and acts like their dad.  I just laughed.  Finally, in the middle of a rice field there was a random sign that had the kanji (chinese characters) for Shiogama.  We decided to follow the sign and after going down a narrow road, we reached the end and were faced with deciding right or left with not another sign in sight.  Honestly, who designed this country without road signs anywhere except big cities?!?!?!? We ended up finding our way, ran into two more Jets on the side of the road in kashimadai who we stopped to talk to for 30 minutes, and eventually I arrived at Steph's an hour late for our dinner/movie night.  She and Kristel were starving and had already taken care of ordering food so 10 minutes after I arrived we were enjoying dinner and watching several episodes of  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .  All in all a pretty eventful day!
