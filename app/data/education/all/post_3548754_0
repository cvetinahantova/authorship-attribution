Went to the dentist this morning so, passed by my parish to get my baptismal certificate needed for my confirmation on July 31. Myk texted he cant make it to the meeting tonight with my "coord". He'll join next time...  I think I ate too much today. Hahahahaha! o yeah, bad news, my titA is having a threatened miscarriage. My friend just had one two. Hers was the second miscarriage. Gosh!  Got to Glorietta earlier than expected. Went around but finally got tired. Went ahead to Bon Appetit. We were actually the last ones to leave literally. Sinasabuyan na nila ng sabon yung floor, we were still there. Hehehehe. Meeting was productive. At least now I know that someone will be there para damayan ako.
