Life can be so simple. Waking up each morning, eating breakfast then going to work. At twelve noon you take your lunch after which is back to work perhaps. Have a little snack just before 5pm. Go home after 5, watch your favorite telenovelas, eat your dinner take a bath then go to sleep. During weekends a little chit-chat with the friends perhaps or a little Saturday night out, just to ease the tension made by the previous week and getting ready for the week ahead. But still life is simple. That is, if your life has not yet been infected by the disease called Makititis. This disease was discovered by a soon to be doctor known to many as Meme. Signs and symptoms exhibited are the following: uncontrollable emotions especially with the same specie (with or without relation to the definitive host) storming around the patient. Mind and body coordination is impaired especially when using body language. There is also a distinct affinity to the opposite sex (especially with those species whose names end with an MD, FPSP, or even USNavy -  Joke) (RMT din ata pero medjo minimal in effect) as well as slight affinity to the same sex who prefer the same sex (I think so?). Slight discomfort in conversations using extreme lasalistic english with atenean intent with matching paulinian accent. High affinity to family especially with the Father and the oldest single brother. There is also extreme outburst of feelings related to memory. There are also episodes of laughter especially with friends. The patient could also experience unpredictable madness towards you even if the reason is never you. To anyone who experienced these signs and symptoms, you are infected with the disease. Isolation must never be performed and treatment is never recommended. This disease must be spread to all human race. This disease is the causative agent of the syndrome called: wild life syndrome which then progresses into memorable life. Unluckily, this disease only affects one human being at a time, although friends would experience the signs and symptoms at a certain degree depending on your affinity to the disease. To date, there is only one patient with this case with the full-blown disease. Some are also infected but to a minimal extent. Come to think, man doesnt want to get sick (sabi nga diba: Bawal magkasakit!). In the contrary, I am infected with this disease and I love it (her). And I want to die with it. For the time being, sorry guys, you cant get the full-blown stage of the disease coz I occupy the spot.   Love is given, she gives her love in a very unique way, and I love her for that and never will I regret the day I said: I love her. (Kahit maraming umaligid man sa kanya o sa akin!)    	 		 __________________________________ Do you Yahoo!? Friends.  Fun.  Try the all-new Yahoo! Messenger. http://messenger.yahoo.com/
