I can't write tonight... have a song going through my head and it's the only thing I can think about.   Wishing my man would get off his computer:..     Throw your arms around me     by Hunters and Collectors    (though I like Paul McDermott's and Eddie Vedder's versions)    I will come for you at night time  And I will raise you from your sleep  I will kiss you in four places  As I go running up your street  And I will squeeze the life out of you  And you will make me laugh and make me cry  And we may never forget it  You will make me call your name  And I'll shout it to the blue summer sky   And we may never meet again  So shed your skin and lets get started  And you may throw your arms around me  Yeah you may throw your around me   Well I came for you at night time  And I watched you in your sleep  Lord I met you in high places  I kissed your head and kissed your feet  Now if you disappear out of view  You know that I will never say goodbye  And though I try and forget it  You will make me call your name  And I'll shout it to the blue summer sky   And we may never meet again  So shed your skin and lets get started  And you may throw your arms around me  Well I came for you at night time  And I watched you in your sleep  Lord I kissed you in four places  I kissed your head and kissed your feet  Throw your arms around me  Yeah you may throw your arms around me
