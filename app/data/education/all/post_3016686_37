So yesterday I had to chance to see the one DC "talking head" I have always wanted to see. I don't usually  speak  to famous people when I see them, though I do tend to look them in the eye. But I always said that if I ever met Michele Martin of ABC News ("This Week") and PBS ("Washington Week"), that I would tell her what a  right-on  woman I think she is. I had a whole 30-second speech planned out.   Yesterday, June 17, on my way home, my moment arrived. The lovely Michele Martin was getting into a cab near the ABC studios off of Conn Ave and was talking to 2 teenage girls standing about 10 feet away from her. Not sure who they were, but I don't think they were her kids (she just had a baby). I tried  ever so  to be polite and not interrupt, so I slowed way down, waiting for my window of opportunity. When it became clear they weren't going to stop talking, I went for broke. Standing in the middle of the street between Filene's and The Mayflower I rooted myself into the cement, pointed at her (which caught her eye) and screamed  I love you - you ROCK!  (emphasis on rock). She was about 20 feet away and looked at me and yelled back -not missing a beat-  "Thank  you, but don't tell me, tell them!" nodding to the girls. I have no idea who they were, but the girls didn't see me and I just kept going.  It was not your usual DC encounter, but I think I made my point, albeit looking like a slightly crazed fan in the process.   Here is a photo/bio of  urlLink Michele, my belle .
