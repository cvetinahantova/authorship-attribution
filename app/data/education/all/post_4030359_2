I will write a poem for you all. It is called, 'Oh, I am tired.' Oh, I am tired At my small and uncomfortable desk I am sleepy, I am snoozing On a mound of mess Sometimes I wish for the comforts of home Where it wasn't so hot and sunny But then I realize That I wasn't making this much money To sit and pick my nose And occasionally bat my eye Once, I started to drool on my desk And almost ate a fly. I fill my time with activities That seem to be so long Then I realize 5 minutes have passed By the sound of the big clock's gong Oh ALT's, your job is different Than any I have ever known To do little work and make money And write really bad poems I am sorry if this poem really sucks And that the lyrics aren't that deep But unfortunately, if I didn't write it I would almost certainly be asleep.
