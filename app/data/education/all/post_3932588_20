I found this article on Her Sports online and thought it was very relevant to us and our training program. Enjoy!    Staying On Target How to meet your athletic goals in 10 easy steps!   By Dawna Stone - Her Sports Magazine  As an athlete, you’ve probably set a few goals: Run a marathon, learn how to surf or summit a local peak. Setting goals gives us something to shoot for and helps keep us motivated as we reach our successes. But while most of us are good at identifying broad goals, knowing how to achieve them is the real trick.        Following are 10 steps that will have you reaching new heights, and then setting the bar even higher.   1) Put it in ink. Write your goals on a piece of paper and tape it to your bathroom mirror, the refrigerator, your computer screen or anywhere you’ll see it every day. Be specific, read them often, and allow them to become part of your daily routine.   2) Don’t sabotage your success. We all love a challenge, but setting a goal to run a marathon for your first road race is lofty for most people. If you’ve never run before, choose a 5k, and sketch out a plan to do your first marathon the following year. Setting your goals too high gives you an excuse for not achieving them. Setting the bar just high enough will keep you hungry for more  3) Set milestones. Breaking your goal into short-term goals will lead to the biggest gains. Set daily and weekly training goals that move you one step closer to your big goal. And, just like your main goal, write them down.   4) Get group support. The old adage the more the merrier applies here. Having a group or training partner to help hold you accountable will get you out of bed for even the toughest workouts. Find a training group or club in your area, or, if you prefer, find a training partner or two who share your goal. You’ll not only help each other reach your goals, but will share in each other’s successes.   5) Set a deadline! A goal without a timeline merely leads to procrastination. Give yourself a final deadline, and create a structured timeline to complete your short-term goals. Procrastination is not an option.   6) Track your progress. Use a notebook or logbook to stay on track. Write your main goal on the first page, and each day record what you accomplished and what’s on schedule for the next day. Review your notes often, and revel in how far you’ve come.   7) Spread the word. When others expect great things from you, you’re more likely to rise to the occasion. Share your goals with your spouse, family members, friends and co-workers, and allow them to act as another support group.   8) Reap the rewards. Indulge in small rewards when certain milestones are met. Rewarding yourself with gifts that support your goals—a new pair of running shoes, a heart rate monitor—will motivate you to stay on track.   9) Anticipate bumps in the road. Goals aren’t intended to be easy. It’s common to start off strong and lose steam along the way. Realize this is part of the process, and see any bumps as extra challenges that will make your rewards all the sweeter.   10) Revisit your goals. If a bump in the road—injury, for instance—derails you, re-evaluate your time frame. Not being able to achieve your goal in the time frame you initially set doesn’t mean you have to abandon it altogether. On the other hand, if your training is going better than expected and you’re surpassing your milestones, it’s time to make things more challenging!
