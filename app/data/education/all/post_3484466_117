Yes, I beat the Sacrifice demo... turns out I was almost finished with the last level at the time I stopped... figures. Anyway, I went back to Ground Control and beat a couple more missions there, as well... I haven't played games in a while, so I'm quite enjoying myself, now. I just need to get someone else playing GC so we can play online. Heh. Heh. Heh. Yes, anyway. I'm off again.  Current Music: Sarah McLachlan - Sweet Surrender
