My wife and I went to see  urlLink Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban  this weekend. A huge leap forward from the previous two both in cinematic elements and screenplay. I do, however, think that parents need to exercise caution with this movie, when it comes to allowing children to view this movie. There are a few "scary" parts and should be a lot of questions afterwards. Being able to use a movie/book such as Harry Potter to lead into discussion about God and The Gospel is something we should take advantage of at the height of the success and popularity of Harry Potter.  I recommend reading  urlLink What's A Christian To Do With Harry Potter?
