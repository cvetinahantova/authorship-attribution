Welcome to the flagship blogging madness of "Three Girls Grown Up".  We are three "former college girls" who have been friends for... eons, I guess.  We made it through school (well some of us did, some of us are STILL IN SCHOOL) and are navigating/fumbling our way through life as adults.  We miss the days of sitting around curled up on the couch babbling until all ours, hands cupped around hot tea, cocoa or whatever.  Long days sitting in the porch swing, road trips, truth-or-dare, just being together and basically just BEING.  This is our way of doing that despite being scattered to the four winds.  Thanks for joining us!
