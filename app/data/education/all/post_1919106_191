Ok, I fixed the color part... Mostly. After some important changes (including an ugly bug that had crept in and had me banging my head against the table for a good hour or two) I can now use more than one color base. Well, mostly. There's only one problem because by using two color bases they taint each other, so instead of yellow (for red + green) you get a dirty yellow. Which would be acceptable except that the initial spikes are not tainted, and thus stick out. It's probably just a matter of figuring out how they interact, but right now the official stance in my documentation is "use just one color, I'm not responsible for anything else". For the moment I'm stuck waiting for a response on the  connect()  method implementation. I figure that I'll spend the waiting time looking at Jingwei's code and importing some of his program's features, specially the importer for his databases.  Or  I could just go ahead and work on the sorting algorithm. Hmm, yes, that sounds like a better idea.
