Guys, I'm still having trouble with PHP's  include()  and  require() . PHP just will not recognize the functions defined in the included files.  I triple checked all my code and even tried to use Larry's test.php, but something's still not working.  If someone could look at  urlLink /academics/english/courses  I'd appreciate it.  The code I'm trying to run eventually would read:    <?php  include('http://webdev.alma.edu/repository/files/lib.php');  display_courses($dept='ENG');  ?>    Right now, I'd be happy simply if  say()  would work for me.
