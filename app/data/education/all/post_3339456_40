In the same article, Kofi Annan refers to AIDS as a form of terrorism, and wonders aloud where the response is.  I think that is a very astute observation.  It makes one realize just how inapporopriate the priorities of the US and the Western world are right now.  We have the terrorism that the US is battling in the middle east.  There are much betters ways (eg look at root causes) it can be addressed than with war and occupation, and the breeding of new terrorists.  Conversely, look at how pitiful our response to the global AIDS panemic is.  Quite frankly, it smacks of racism.  Some people of a different colour skin in very poor countries in the middle east need to be bombed and occupied, to "civilize" them.  On the other hand, a disease that affects mostly black people in very poor countries in Africa means almost nothing to us, judging by our governments' response.
