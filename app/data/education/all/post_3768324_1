I promised myself I wouldn't put a lot of links in this thing when I started it, but here goes nothing, regardless. Look at this link, from Fox 26 News in Houston:    urlLink http://www.fox26.com/predator/HISD%20schools%20A.htm    I work in that district.   Do you know there's an entire blog dedicated to whether or not Jessica Simpson's breasts are real? A valid topic, without a doubt... but an entire blog?   20 "bloggers" got accredited for the DNC next week in Boston. It's really a shame I didn't start this thing earlier. Ah, pipe dreams.   As for the DNC, I'd like to see an unified, coherent message emerge and Kerry bounce to the clear frontrunner before Bush's 9-11 showcase in late August. I think Kerry needs a 30 minute speech - maybe as low as 25 - that emphasizes his credentials without bashing them over the heads of unsuspecting midwestern viewers, while explaining why these credentials are uniquely suited (or, say, moreso uniquely suited) to guide our nation than Bush's corresponding credentials. I think he eventually needs to address the inherent disconnect of most Dem. nominees for President - how can you argue for the resolution of "two Americas" (Edwards' big thing) when, in fact, you're chillin and windsurfin' on Nantucket ("where the millionaires mow the lawns of the billionaires") over the weekend.    Question of the Day Are Jessica Simpson's breasts real? (someone's gotta ask it)
