I am very sad tonight.I sms my Godmum at 9.50pm telling her that this friday is my birthday..I waited for her reply anxiously..At 10.02 pm,i received an sms and discovered that she has reply to my sms.I was soo happy and can;t wait to see her message..To discover that she say she was on a tour wit her family till sunday is a great blow to me..I don knoe if i can be happy on friday without her presence..I just hope i can see her again..
