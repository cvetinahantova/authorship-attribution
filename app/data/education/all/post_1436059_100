17-17 in overtime, Packers v. Eagles in the playoff games, Eagles win the toss. Somehow Green Bay gets back the ball and then Brett Favre, the veteran quarterback that led Green Bay so far, sends an interception right to the Eagles, the ball flying blindly out of his hands. Inevitably, the Eagles win 20-17 with a field goal kick and the Packers get picked off in the playoffs for the second year in a row. Disappointing. Well, Mr. Jim, I wish your team luck and hopefully the Eagles get as far as they want this year. Brett, sorry 'bout your Father, I can empathize in a way, but I hope that kind of throw never, never, NEVER happens again. Probably my final commentary on Packer's football and football in general until next year.  I finished my Lord of the Flies report on Simon. Wonderful, if I do say so myself, I mean, for only taking a few hours...
