Helloo this is the mightily confused two! (as opposed to ... oh never mind!) I'm here to terrorize this blog ha har!! Ok, i'm only kidding - and anyway i won't have time in between all o' this taking over the world stuff to terrorize measly computer journals. *ahem* ... getting a little carried away. Sorry.  Time to introduce myself.  I am Charlie. This is my Aardvark. I love: my clock that ticks backwards, daydreaming, tea, living in my own little world, jazz music, rock music, being creative (with scissors, glue, paint and paper!) and, of course, Gremlin! I hate: fish, people with their heads stuck up their own *deleted for your protection*, farting, confusing guys, people who don't leave comments (nah, just kidding, honest!), double French and those hamsters that sing and dance to tacky songs. I usually wear blue knickers, and i'm a Saggitarius.  That's me to a tea.  Mmmm... tea.
