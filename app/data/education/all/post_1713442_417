urlLink Promoting the Self-Determination of Students with Severe Disabilities. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Michael Wehmeyer.  It looks at ways that severely disabled students can be made more independent.  From the ERIC Digest:  Promoting the self-determination of students with disabilities has become best practice in special education, particularly in promoting more positive transitions from school to post-school life. Promoting self-determination means addressing skills, knowledge, and attitudes students will need to take more control over and responsibility for their lives.    While efforts to promote self-determination are in place, most of the methods, materials, and strategies they use do not adequately address the instructional needs of students with severe disabilities (Wehmeyer, 1998).    Wehmeyer, Agran, and Hughes (2000) surveyed 1,200 teachers of students with severe disabilities about their beliefs concerning self-determination and the barriers to providing instruction to promote this outcome. Some of barriers they identified are:    * Lack of student benefit from instruction in self-determination (42%)    * Insufficient training or information on promoting self-determination (41%)    * Lack of authority to provide instruction in this area (32%)    * More urgent need for instruction in other areas (29%)    * Lack of teacher knowledge of curricular/assessment materials and strategies (17%)
