Matt and I discovered a potential for big problems with three of us working on the same set of files. Jaguar will let us all have open the same file at the same time, which gives us the potential to lose data.  I suggest we label the files on which we are working, in order to let each other know what we have open and who to address with questions.  If it comes down to calling, I guess I have dibs on green.   Another headache we will have to deal with is copying and pasting from InDesign. Even with the source file we get excess white space and non iso-8859-1 characters. We could do some find and replaces, but I'm still having problems saving my files.  Instead of hopping to UTF-8, would anyone like to volunteer to write a PHP script that will "wash" our InDesign text, outputting good characters and entities (such as &mdash; for â€” and &quot; for ")?
