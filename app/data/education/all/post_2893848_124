Rick Moody is the only alter-ego here   Some of you have been asking me, and I'm pretty sure "Rick Moody" the blog commentator is not Rick Moody the author.  That is, unless he happens to share an IP address with someone else who has been leaving comments with a much less notable name; a name that is a little more familiar around here in the comment threads.      At the time of this post, 50% of poll respondents believe that one, the other, or both of Scott and I do not exist.  There's an irony in all this.  I think I am going to start taking the weekends off from IJ.  But if I have the time and inclination to post, I will.  Other posters are welcome to post over the weekend as they like.
