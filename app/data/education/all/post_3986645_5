Another tedious day.   Type, pause, read, repeat.       Quite simply this has been the wettest summer to my memory. It really is very depressing, and I'm not even a summer person.       I feel so out of sorts. I stayed up until 3 o'clock last night. ( When was the last time  that  happened? ) Then, to my utter suprise and dismay, awoke at 10:30. My body refuses to let me sleep regardless of my mind repeating over and over "There's nothing to do in this house!". So I continue to alternate between transcribing, reading, and staring at my pleasant beeswax candle.       I'm beginning to dislike how boredom brings greater expectations for a new day. Then that day arrives, and somehow, hopes aren't accounted for, and your mood is left indistinguishable from the pensive thoughts of the day before.       So my hopes are sitting in the back of my mind, creeping up whenever I stop to sit and wonder what there is to do next. Time works in odd ways.. sometimes too lethargic, sometimes too hasty.  Too eager for the future and dreading the shadowy implications of it all, while in the meantime I sit and write entries about the present being unsatisfactory. Impossible to please-- Yes, yes I am.
