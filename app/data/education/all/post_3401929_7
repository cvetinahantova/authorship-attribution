Youth Sunday went perfectly (yay!) Whenever someone went up to sing/act they would introduce themselves.  Take Lisa for example.  She went up and said, "Hi, I'm Lisa" and then the whole youth group said, "Hi, Lisa" like they do on Finding Nemo with the sharks.  Anyway, everyone was laughing because we said that like, three times.  It was really fun; I really enjoyed it. Then, we came home, changed clothes, and went to Grammy and Papa's.  We ate dinner there. After we came home, I ran two miles (I didn't walk at all the first mile, but I did the second).  I ran one mile in about six minutes (very happy with myself). I got a shower...and now I'm on the computer.  Woo. We're supposed to get rain sometime tonight...but there aren't that many "potential stormcloud" clouds...stormcloud...is that a word?  I like that word.  Anyway... That was my day.  Weird...I can fit in a box less than 7x5 inches...
