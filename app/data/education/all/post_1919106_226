So, I got this wee camera with a memory stick. I plug in the camera - Windows crashes. I buy a USB stick reader. Windows can't find the driver (even though I specify the location with the right driver). I unplug my (USB) mouse and plug it into a different port. Can't find the driver. I plug in a printer. Can't find the driver. I cry. Can't find the driver. Then I check on the internet, maybe someone there has a solution. First link is a Mandrake Linux forum. They seem to not have a problem... Hmm! I boot into Linux, and  LO AND BEHOLD!  There the fucker is. No problem whatsoever.
