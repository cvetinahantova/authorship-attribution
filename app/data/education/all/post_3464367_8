Have you ever tried to fix things and take control of your destiny then worry about the outcome? Well that is me to a 'T'. I have always had the motto that "If it is going to be, it is up to me!" I try to give others a chance to take action, but when I see things failing or not getting done, I often find myself stressed-out trying to do God's works. The outcome will sometimes be good, but more often than not I tend to make a mess of things, especially when dealling with the issues of my own life.  I have to keep reminding myself that  urlLink I am not in control, it is God that is in control  and He knows the final outcome, so I don't need to worry. But that doesn't mean I should become lazy and just wait on whatever happens in my daily life. I am a firm believer that  urlLink God will not do for you what you can do for yourself . Beside he has given each one of us a talents and the abilty to look to him for direction on how to best use those talents to further His kingdom .  So if I do my part today and pray that God continues to Love me and protect me from my mistakes, I will see that  urlLink all things works out for the good!  I can smile knowing I "can't worry and have faith" at the same time.  :)
