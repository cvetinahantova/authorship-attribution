It looks as though the content management system for Alma's new site has reached completion and is now ready to install on our new webserver, a dual 1.33GHz Apple XServe.  I talked to Dan Benjamin, of  urlLink Autmoatic Labs , this morning, and he informed me that they had completed this portion of the project.  We'll most likely attempt to get everything installed around the first of next week and then do some testing.  I'm suere there will be some necessary  tweaks  as we begin to test the system and see how it works for our needs.  Now we should really be able to start seeing the new site unfold.
