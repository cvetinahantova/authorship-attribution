Well i froze the internet as i was finishing a post and so i have to start over...   i was just babbling about graduation and how it would be funny for Stephen and Angel to be stuck right next to each other and not even know it and that Stephen wants to kill her.. and how school is almost out and in another 12 months i'll be up there in my cap and gown. That's so depressing and so cool at the same time. Makes you think about how much of your life is meaningless. In 12 months no one is going to care who prom queen was. Hell i don't care now lol but you know what i mean.. the whole "omg i need that $300 pair of jeans omg i can NOT be seen shopping at walmart OMG my life is so hard!" all that stuff will seem so stupid and we'll be laughing at ourselves.. and if i'm as good as i think i am you are laughing right now because as always i'm right! i'm not conceited i'm confident darn it..  so i have an interview on friday to talk to this lady about babysitting. should be really cool. she's giving me gas money and big splash passes and money to go shopping with her 2 little girls. this is like my dream job. and speaking of jobs Brandon started his today at some place building ac's and heaters. he called me a little while ago to tell me about all the mexicans he is working with.. he's so racist i'm gonna smack him one of these days.. oh well not everyone can be perfect like me. not even Jim Smith! tho he is the most awesomest person in my head at the moment.. right Amy? hehe.   Well like all awesome things this post must come to an end..
