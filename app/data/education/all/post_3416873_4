Four days until I am unemployed.  It feels great.  One of my students said to me that this is the last Friday that I will be their teacher.  I just smiled.  As I was leaving school this afternoon, I ran into our campus technical coordinator.  Our district is giving out free, refurbished computers to students who do not have computers at home.  The coordinator had just taken a computer out to a parent's car when I ran into her.  She told me to take a look at the car behind me.  I did and she told me that she just loaded a free computer into the trunk.  I asked her if she was serious, and she replied, angrily, with a yes.  The car was a Mercedes.    If you bungle raising your children, I don't think whatever else you do well matters very much.     Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis      urlLink Thank you, Mr. Cosby.
