Saturdays are great for sleepiong in.  Then, Just as you are finally getting ready for the day, having a good freind call.  Rachel called today.  We haven't talked for awhile, and usually we keep in pretty close contact.  Jim and her have been busy remodeling their kitchen.  I'm really curious as to waht it will look like when they are done.  I can't believe I haven't seen Rach for a year!  The last time was when she was a bridesmaid in my wedding.  I think that's the longest now.  I use to make it down to cal more often, but now it's been since Annie's wedding.  For a few months there, I went down thetr four times in like a four month period.  I had Chloe's wedding, then Rachel's, then visited Christy and her new baby, and then Annie's weeding.  Haven't been back since.  The rest of the time has been spent getting ready for my wedding, getting married, and being married.  Which has been absolutely awsome!  John and I do need to make a trip down their sometime in the near future.  Their are a lot of people I want to visit!!  Ok, so John just made kraft mac and cheese, so I better go get my share.  I think we will take a trip to costco today.  They have pj bottoms on sale, and I desparately need some.  At least for the upcoming winter months.  Then I think we are going over to the Christian book store to find some Cd's for our rode trip coming up.  Oh, and I'm really excited, because Christy is calling tonight.  She is my really close freind.  Her and her husband are Bible translators in Papua New Guinea.  Christy just had her 2nd child, Nathan Christian.  They went to Australia to have him, so she can actually call me.  So, can't wait to talk with her.  I bet my mac is cold now. Either than, or John ate my share. J
