urlLink Because soccer isn't crazy enough...    AYUTHAYA (Thailand) - It sounds like a soccer player's worst nightmare: an opposing team whose players each have four legs, weigh no less than 900kg and can block a score simply by lying motionless in front of the goal.  But it was all part of the fun on Sunday as prison officials held an elephant match to discourage inmates from gambling on the Euro Cup in Portugal.  'We expect that people will support the idea that we can get fun from playing football, not gambling on football,' said director-general Nathee Chitsawang of the Thai Corrections Department in Ayuthaya, north of Bangkok.  The prisoners took on the animals, ridden by elephant drivers, from the Ayuthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal. But the result was unclear: either a 5-5 draw or a creditable 7-6 win for the elephants, the BBC reported.  After the game, one of the most prolific elephant scorers, Kocharaa, celebrated by kicking its front legs in the air.  'We train the elephants every day to play soccer, kick the ball, and to keep from stepping on the other people,' said Mr Pattarapon Meepan of the Elephant Palace. 'They try their best. These elephants can do everything.'
