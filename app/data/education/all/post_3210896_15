I heard the news a few hours ago.  urlLink President Regan passed away  around 3:45p (CDT) on Saturday, June 5, 2004.   According to  urlLink AP News , former president Ronald Regan is near death. In the words of his wife, it could happen as soon as this weekend.   What a legacy this man leaves behind! Being that this is the first president of my generation to pass away, it's kind of sobering. I often find myself wondering what this world would be like had he been elected president in 2000 or what if he had never been elected in the first place. I remember back in the summer of 2000, I took a tour of Hollywood and Beverly Hills and got to drive by his home. The house number is 667, he had it changed from it's original number... 666 .   See you soon, Gipper.
