hello,  well today was an interesting day.  apparently i got hired just in time for teacher's day.  it was an experience.  the kids all set up in trinity hall which similar to fulton chapel at ole miss or any other large auditorium.  the kids all stand and sing as the teachers walk single file to the stage area where there were chairs for us to sit in.  then they prayed in thai so i have no idea what they were saying.  then one girl read a poem, another  sang, and one read a speech in english.  the speech was about the importance of teachers and how they are second parents to all the students. next one girl for every teacher walked on her knees to present the teacher with a flower arrangement.  the arrangement were so beautiful and the air in trinity hall was filled with the fragrance of fresh flowers.  glad i'm not allergic. anyway.   unfortunately i didn't get to keep the flower arrangement given to me.  also, i found a place to live.  it's extremely close to the school.  i move in on june 25th.  i'm ready to have my own space.  molly's place is nice but i won't miss the commute.  plus most of the teachers i work with live in the same area.  well gotta go.  love ya'll.  jane  ps.  i know how to send pictures i just keep forgetting to bring my camera with me to work.  i promise to send some soon.
