Nothing much today.  My #2 son played a baseball game.  We won 3 - 1.  He still didn't have a hit and he played second base the whole game.  No pitching today.  "A" pitched all seven innings.  I hope that doesn't come back to haunt us later in the year (worn out arm).  #1 son plays tomorrow night.  I have to tell his coach that he will miss a game the 26th.  He won't be happy.  Such is life.
