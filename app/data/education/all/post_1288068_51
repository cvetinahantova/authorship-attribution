Yes I know, it's tragic. All this time to myself, the whole of London at my doorstep, and I'm sitting in the dark blogging. I'm sure everyone else is lounging around in fabulously shabby bars being desirable and louche, but I am just hanging out here, clearing up the debris of a two month long housework embargo.  Am finding it hard to wind down into holiday mode and feel slightly frantic about the various odds and ends that need to be done before September. I think my brain is just looking for some displacement stress; you can't just expect it to stop suddenly like that.  Have spent most of today listening to '30s jazz and considering seaside holiday destinations. Seem to be slipping irretrievably into Wodehousian fantasy in which I have land and a sense of moral outrage.  Miss you x
