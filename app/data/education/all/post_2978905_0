So... the news as of late, I am still working towards the whole learning the guitar bit.  I must say that I am rather impressed that I have not yet given up, though I have certainly thought about it.  I would like to learn a few more songs, just so that I don't have to constantly play the intro to Disarm.  That I can say, was the first song I learned, thanks to my brother.  I also phoned him up this afternoon, and he taught me the intro to Time of My Life, by Green Day....  I will defeat you Mr. Murphy.. it will take time, but I am certain to defeat you.  For all of you who are not yet aware of Mr. Murphy.. he is my shiny red guitar.  We are great friends.  I would say that is about it... Pretty boring for a Sunday afternoon, but I would think that was what Sundays were made for.    Cheerio
