one of those days where you feel totally not connected to your body.  This evening is like that.  I could fall asleep right here, right now.    I think it is because I haven't ate anything but candy today.  Yes, I know that is bad and I am sending a hugely horrible message to my kids.  But some days, you jsut dont' want food.  YOu want junk.  All the junk you can find.  Candy, chips, ice cream, you name it, you want it.  I have ate some dried fruits, trail mix type stuff today.  Not much, just wasn't as appetizing as the chocolate covered raisins were.
