I met Justin at Phipps Plaza tonight. We went to see the movie "Dodgeball". It was really funny but the plot was stupid. It's a good movie to see if you feel like laughing and not thinking. After the movie we went to Justin's favorite place,  urlLink Johnny Rockets . Not my favorite place but there were not many choices at 10pm on a Sunday night. We had a nice time together...too short as usual. Now I need to be working on grad school stuff but I just can't seem to get motivated..
