I got all my paperwork together, the pencil, a pad of paper, a calculator, the tax guide and paperwork, ready to get it over and done with for another year. Well, after making and signing the original and a copy, filling in and ticking all the right boxes, I was all finished - after a total of 10 minutes!!! Whoo hoo! If only every other year was as easy as this one when it came to tax time!
