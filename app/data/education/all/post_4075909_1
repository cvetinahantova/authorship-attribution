OH NO!  Who the hell wants to watch the pageant now?  The talent portion is axed?  NO NO NO!!!  The ratings are going down, down, down.  That was the best part besides the bathing suits.  Shame on the committee, shame on ABC.  And I still LOVE you Peter Krause even though you bombed on Broadway!  I watched Guiding Light, Harely found out about Gus, uh oh.  Now, All My Children time.  I must sit and be subjected to Bianca in her "Everyone has sex but me because I'm gay" bit.  The power of standards and practices goes way beyond my little hands.
