Finding the current discussions on Anglican Bishops v. sad.  I guess the stakes are high for both involving a potent mix of sexual identity and belief in who men are, in what love is and in what God's word says.    For me, I think I know what is in the bible about it all but I know too that we re-interpret other parts with no qualm of conscience and call it context or whatever, so it seems a bit hypocritical to say that we can't do others.  So maybe that makes me more of an anglican than an anglican't - but most of my friends would prob be the other way round.    Most of all I am deeply saddened that Christians are allowing themselves to be shown as reactionary, uncaring and unmoving.  But I can see why it is that way.  If you believe that its God's unchanging word at stake then there's a lot to fight for.  Think too thought that we are a bit too ready to see ourselves (Evangelical Christians I mean) as a put upon minority.  Maybe in this case we are not the minority.  Maybe here we are the oppressive institution.    Lord Have mercy.
