Got back into LaGuardia (LGA) today. Very, very tired. Still have homework to do, and I start summer school, with actual children, tomorrow morning. Thank God tomorrow is just observation!  Am planning to return to Tx in August as soon as my university stuff is done for the summer. I will start teacher inservice, assuming one of my 3 as-of-yet unscheduled follow-ups go well and I have a place to go, on Sept 7. Kids arrive Sept 13. Wow.  Was very glad to see kittens, as they are quite furry and cute and make the world seem like a better place when they curl up next to me purring. They were obviously well taken care of by Aunt Sarah, who revealed to me that Sydney has honored her by sleeping on her lap over the weekend. Awwww.
