Can't stand that day.  Quite.  Well I should really be at lunch, but I figured I'd get this post sorted first.  The school is absolutely crawling with posh kids, and of course a committee of vahry posh adults too (who keep on pestering me with requests for extra pillows, sliced rather than diced ham, and a million and one other things that would never occur to a less eccentric soul).  She works hard for the money?  Hell, yes. But hey, I managed to escape at ten thirty for a couple of hours, so it's not all bad.  I am spending so much time online at the moment.  As well as FT, I am also spending a lot of time on YMDB, which is great fun.  I just love talking (or should that be typing) about films.  I really hope I can get back to studying them one day!     Got a letter from Sian-shine this morning, which was cool.  I really do love letters, as old school as that sounds.  Must write more soon.  Speaking of stuff I'd better do soon, studying and packing come to mind.  This room is a tip, and yet I'm off home in two weeks.  Shite, better hit it.  Current music:  Nelly Furtado, Powerless.  I like this song, but it's not as good as Try. Current mood:  coasting along.  You? Last person spoke to:  Cat, who's just gone into London.  Jealous, moi? Next:  finding a courier company, facing the firing squad (my meal numbers were out), and grabbing  sandwhich.
