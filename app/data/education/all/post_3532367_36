The mortgage offer arrived today and everything seems to have gone through OK. It says they will NOT allow any further second interests (secured loans) on the property - Yipee!  We are going to get a friend to go over the paperwork with us as its a bit confusing with the terminology. The total amouont of the loan (including our existing mortgage is 135,000 UKP! Frightening really. I've still not heard off the counselor which is worrying me slightly. Still I will chase it up with the doctor when I see her next.
