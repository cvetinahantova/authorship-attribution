I'm leaving On a jet plane (on Sunday). Don't know when I'll be back again.  Actually, I do.  I'll be back in a week.  I think I can handle a week with the fam-damily.  My buddy  urlLink James  was kind enough to offer to care for  urlLink Mr. D.  while I'm gone.  What can I say?  Santiago es la bomba otra vez.
