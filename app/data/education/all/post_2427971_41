Ive wondered why its always night time when im like this... and yet Im so used to going to LAN Parties and having a great time. Must be the solitary feeling in my corner with my whole life right in front of me... Seems its all I need when im here, though it isnt in any way, it just feels that way. Like I don't need anyone else but myself and my corner... But thats not true at all, I need everyone and everything thats in my life at the moment... they are the only things that really help me on my feet after falling all the time. theres so much crap to deal with... and when i look back theres all these people to help me with all of it... I take for granted too many things that i have and should cherish always, theres no telling when something might happen to them. Theres no way to keep anything forever, thats why it should be taken for granted to see as everything i have as a privelage... I dont need it all but fuck if i didnt id be somewhere completly different right now, so much support. there are more things i need to change about myself, there are more things i need to improve. there always seems to be, but its worth the time and effort... i cant get enought sleep, im always tired and when im tired im in a crappy mood... bad timing... that and night dont add well, anyways... I promise it wont happen Kat, trust me... im out of words, going to sleep... night
