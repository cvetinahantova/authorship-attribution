something Other Than SchOOL!    Â  I guess it's the end of the semester or so it is for most undergraduates and I suppose--even myself. As today marked the last day of the semester for me...I am DONE! Yes, very very done. I will graduate tomorrow with my masters. I suppose I still have a bit to do, as I will be teaching General Microbiology again this summer.  Mmm...what else to talk about. Yes the survivor episode sucked last night. I hope Rupert or Jenna win...I seriously hope Rob dies or LOSES...and Amber that playing girl loses as well....
