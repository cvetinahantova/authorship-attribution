I picked this new template..... now I'm not quite sure what I think of it.  Still kind of greeny and clean looking.  Not that I want some dirty lookin' page, just something a little more blah.  I thought the leaf-looking things were kind of neat though :)  I'm a science teacher, right?  G'night for sure this time.  Lucy is so spoiled... sleepin' on my lap while I type.  Who spoiled her?  How could I  not  when she's da cutest?  lol.... I'm so pathetic.
