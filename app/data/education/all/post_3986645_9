Why do I constantly feel let down?   Are my expectations too high?   Or have you never been as perfect as my mind portrayed you?       The streets are uneven and my eyes won't raise.       Why are the meanings to actions never interpreted correctly?       Why don't questions have answers?       One of those days... (weeks? months?) where nothing is sufficient and everything only seems to get worse.   Every day spent leaning towards the next.   Is one solid hope worth more than a carload of certainties?   Tonight I'd beg to differ.       Nothing is sustainable    I'm only delaying inevitability.       Why is it we only miss the past?   [why can't heartfelt kisses make another person open their eyes]   I wish I could move my eyes elsewhere
