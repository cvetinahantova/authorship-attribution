Fear me!   For I've been put in the same group as  Trogdor, The Burninator .    You are Form 5,  Dragon : The Weaver.   "And The Dragon seperated the virtuous from the sinful.  He tore his eyes from his sockets and used them to peer into the souls of those on trial to make a judgement.  He knew that with endless knowledge came endless responsibility."    Some examples of the Dragon Form are Athena (Greek), St. Peter (Christian), and Surya (Indian).  The Dragon is associated with the concept of intelligence, the number 5, and the element of wood. His sign is the crescent moon.  As a member of Form 5, you are an intelligent and wise individual.  You weigh options by looking at how logical they are and you know that while there may not always be a right or wrong choice, there is always a logical one.  People may say you are too indecisive, but it's only because you want to do what's right.  Dragons are the best friends to have because they're willing to learn.   urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?
