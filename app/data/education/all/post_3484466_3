Well, I just wanted to make one more post before I go to bed... not much to say, though.  Actually, I might not go to bed. I haven't quite decided yet... I probably will, though. Whatever. I don't have anything better to do.  I'm supposed to go to Katy's tomorrow for her birthday, and I don't think I can go. She's gonna kill me...  Ok, well, I'm going to either go to bed or find something to do, now.  Current Music: Elton John - Your Song
