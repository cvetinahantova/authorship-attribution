Well Contrary to my beliefs it is actually extremely easy to get a job over here in London. The first Job I have already mentioned to some of you, I was in Reading (pronounced redding) with Rachelle we were just cruising around doing banking and window shopping things etc. At the end of the day we both decided to go and have a well earned beer. Lydia our first contact and fantastic host in London had mentioned to Rachelle the location of a certain Walkabout* pub in Reading to which we casually made a way towards. After the first Guinness I decided I like the layout and feel of the local and approached the friendly bar attended with the question in mind "do you need staff"; "Yeah probably" was the reply. I was asked to write down my details on a piece of paper and that the boss would get to back to me on this one, I feared the worst (the ole don’t call us, we’ll call you scenario). But as I was half way through getting my details down on paper, I nice Australian popped up in front of me and said "so you looking for work then eh" the conversation is condensed in to the following:  Yep Can you cook? Yep Really? Really good How much bar experience do you have? Twoish years Can you start on Monday?  So Now I have a Job working in an awesome Pub famed for having 3 month long waiting lists for staff wanting to work in one of the most casually prestigious watering holes in London area. Today I have my trial night, I have absolutely no reservations about not getting the job, I love the social atmosphere of bars, and I think I am a fairly efficient, happy, intelligent worker.  This morning I got a call from a company asking me if I would set up a Linux server for them. One day worth of work for no less than £24.00 per hour. Yet another job that I am totally stoked to be doing.   Iife is good!  *Famed throughout the world as one of the likely watering holes for Aus/NZealanders to meet up, hook up or generally just have a good time.
