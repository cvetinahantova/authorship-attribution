Oh it just sounds so good...    Â  On my trip to Pakistan this year, or well two weeks ago it ended--I had my cousins go out and get me some CD of singers from Pakistan. Mmm...the Cd's they got me were great. I listen to them all the time. And the more the singer sings in Punjabi, the better. For those who dont' know, I come from the province of Punjab in Pakistan. In punjab, one of the languages spoken is punjabi. I find it to be a beautiful language; it just sounds soo good!! I mean I can understand it mostly, speak it a bit, but love it overall. So listening to these songs just feels and sounds sooo good! I guess it's something twangy in the way they sing that just sounds great....Oh I've been writing a lot on here...I'm out to get stuff done now I guess...like study for my biochemistry test which is on friday :((((((((
