On two seperate occasions today I was reminded of the loss of our Jessica and how painful it still is.  It seems as if the emotions are right under the surface only to be awakened by the right stimulus.  Today I watched a movie and a TV show where a loved one was lost.  This rekindled my feelings of loss and that loss is still painful.  The pain is just as real today as it was on August 5, 2001 as I watched the funeral home director remove my daughters lifeless body from our home on 159 Mapleridge Dr in Goose Creek SC.   It is still so hard to believe that we will not see our Jessica again this side of eternity.  It is still so hard to believe how cancer changed our little girl right before our eyes.  I was reminded that I need to light a candle for my "sunshine angel".   I had not done that in a very long time.  I guess the act of lighting a candle helped me in some way but it also reminded me of the truth of what has happened.  Our lives will never be the same and even though Jessica is gone she will always be in our hearts, souls and minds.  We love you Jessica Ann Moffitt , You are our Sunshine!!
