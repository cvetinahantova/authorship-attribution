Man I have so much to say but I'm so damn tired.  I've read everyone else's blogs and that was great fun.  I'll read them again when I'm not about to fall alseep.  I'll just spit it out and hope it all comes out right.  I'd have to say this has been the best weekend for me since I got here.  Friday night was good.  I took care of some business and then went drinking for a bit downtown.  We tried to bar hop but that kinda failed after the third bar.  I'm too tired to remember if anything really cool happened on Friday.  I don't think it did.  We all met at Seattle's and moved around to, The Commune of course then it was off to somewhere called Captian Morgan's or something.  That place was cool.  Very small and cozy.  Not really my style but it was cool.  I'm trying to think who was out.  It was Becky, Asma, Eileen, Meabh, Simon, and Peter.  At some point we picked up a guy who is locally known as Jesus, b/c he resembles the son of God.  Then we went to Jazz on Jazz.  After that it was back to The Commune.  I'm just all Communed out.  I can't take much more of it anymore.  I hadn't gotten enough sleep and was surprised I made it this far.  I got home around 3ish I think.   Saturday was the bomb.  First after work I went to the PC room with some of my students and we played Star Craft.  I lost.  We were playing a shitty map and I had the worst player on my team.  I was the last one standing however.  Then I hooked with Fenton and at some pork.  That was followed by a video game extravaganza.  We beat both Bad Dudes and Cadallacs and Dinosaurs.  Both great games.  We then headed downtown.  On the way out as fate would have it we bumped into Meabh and Eilleen.  Maybe a little bit awkward. I'm too tired, I'll fill in the rest later.  I'm not even gonna spell check.
