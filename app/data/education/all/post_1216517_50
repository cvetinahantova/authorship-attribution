RABBIT AND ELECTRONIC MAIL  I desire a 1984 VW rabbit 5-speed convertable.  i crave one like the bear in the empty moat of cesky krovlov castle craves the snickers that small children dangle 10 metres above his head.  I would be one cool ass mutha funker if I had one of those.  I would cruise with the top down and jam to Blondie.  I will name it Sanchez II  I don't know kung fu.  Do you?

OH NO!� He asked if I knew why he stopped me.. I thought well I only have one brake light or maybe I was speeding. I said "No." �He told me I was driving too close to the car in front of me..� I was upset..�What a stupid reason to stop someone.�The young police officer warned me not to tailgate and did not give me a ticket. I was too late to see the flares.. I saw a few. Then today I went to take my mom to the parade�and�it rained and very windy so we went back home to enjoy a cook-out with my sister and brother &��and family. A good time was had by all...� HA.. HA ..HA..� Dan and I get home and Jesse and his friends are in the pool with lots of beer bottles everywhere.. I was not a happy camper !! �I hope the fireworks don't get rained out!! Happy 4th to you all Laura   yeah, that was a good one.  I'm still living in the desert.  i want to kung Fu it up the wazoo
