I just kinda realized that there is no point in my putting titles on these posts... the majority of them are completely random and useless, and very few have any substantial meaning. Of course, I'll continue to use them, but I just thought I'd acknowledge their lack of purpose. Anyway, I figured I'd just update every few minutes until I get bored with that and go elsewhere.
