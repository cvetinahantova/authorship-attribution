.......................................  a moment to celebrate  .......................................  one front burner successfully fried.  eight or nine to go.  this morning i turned in my tenure and promotion folder.  for those of you who know -- that thing has been consuming me for way too long.  for those of you who are interested (dad) -- an online version of most of it will be available soon. (i'll post a link for you here)  i get the enjoyable privilege of chillin with  my kids for the next two hours -- and we're looking forward to ex-roomates deke & kelly coming into visit with baby anna this weekend.   we've got a hopeful prospect checking out the house (we think? we hope?) on sunday...  for those of you who i owe an email or a call.  let me do what i'm best at right now -- apologize:   sorry.   the truth is that the front burners are still gonna be grilling for the next two weeks.  and the optimist in me says that after thanksgiving they'll be more manageable.    Realistically?  look for an email at Christmas Break.   Sorry to be so *absent* when the *presence* of your life & voice in my life is gives me life and energy...  happy birthday to butch! (tho' i'm pretty sure you don't read -- maybe someone else will, though, email Butch! He's 34!)  love & peace ~
