As if this summer hasn't been nightmarish enough, last night I stepped off the sidewalk in front of the deck and broke a couple metatarsals in my left foot!  There's nothing quite like the sound of bone breaking as you fall to the recently mown grass in the dark of night - all because you had to go and get your cat (who has 3 legs by the way).  It only gets better.  Hubby is plopped in front of the TV finishing up dinner (we ate late 9:30 pm), and I'm writhing around on the ground trying to call out to him - he thinks I'm hollering for the cat.  Anyway, I finally manage to lift myself off the ground enough to wave frantically at him.  Out he comes, and off we go, 30 miles, to the emergency room.  Unfortunately, two mini-vans full of adults and kids collided east of town - the small hospital was a bit overwhelmed; some of the kids had to be life-flighted, and some of the adults had to be taken to other area hospitals.  Rightly so, my foot was not a priority, and we were told that it would be 4:30 or 5:00 am before the x-ray machines would be free and a doctor would be free.  So off we go, 30 miles back home (the nurse did wrap my foot and tell me to keep ice on it as they really couldn't do anything while it was still swollen).  Once home, hubby makes me comfortable on the couch (as comfortable as a tummy sleeper can be on her back), I doze off and on fitfully through the night, and once morning comes, off we go again to the ER.  The upshot of all this is, I have to see an orthopedist tomorrow to get my foot set and get a cast (maybe).  Meanwhile, I am trundling around with a little blue shoe-thingy and some crutches.  My first broken bone in my entire life has to be something as ignominious as a metatarsal, SHEESH!!!
