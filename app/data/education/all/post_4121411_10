I watched the second episode of the Singapore Idol...it was hilarious!!! I really can't believe how thick-skinned some of the participants can be...however there were a few touching moments...like when the guy with speech defect came in to prove that "there's a will,there's a way", the girl who is hearing impaired...oh,not to miss, the girl who has nothing but only her voice,no looks,no nothing,but she made it through with just her voice...really encouraging..
