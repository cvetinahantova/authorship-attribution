I'm going to try for the third freakin' time tonight to add another post.  My first was witty and insightful, my second thoughtful and sincere, this one, well, I'm just crabby now!  It's my own fault that I can't follow directions and keep hitting the stupid "back" button, thus losing everything I've written.  I'd be thinking more clearly if I'd do this at another time, but the three cups of coffee I had at dinner have done a number on me.  I'll be lucky if I get to bed before 4:00 a.m.  Thank God for summer vacation.  My only plans for tomorrow are to "maybe" go see a movie.  They are changing to "definitely" taking a nap...  I had a delightful encounter with someone I met in a chat room tonight.  This person - I'll call him Kaspar - was caring and helpful and talked with me about some issues I hadn't talked about with anyone, but sorely needed to.  I deeply appreciated his advice.  It makes me miss having the males friends who have come and gone out of my life.  I haven't had any "man friend" to talk to since Mark drifted out of my like a few years ago.  I really value the advice that Kaspar gave me.  I will keep sending good thoughts his way.  I always marvel that the Internet provides a way for people who would otherwise never have met to connect with one another.  It's nice not to feel alone in this world.
