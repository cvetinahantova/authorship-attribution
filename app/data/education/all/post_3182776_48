It's been so long since I've been here, I've almost forgotten what to do, and so much stuff has happened, I hardly know what to write.  In the past two weeks the following things have happened:  1) I got a job. 2) PGCE came to it's final, shuddering halt. 3) I had a few days off, for the first time in God Only Knows How Long. 4) I started my job. 5) My computer finally shuffled off its electronic coil, taking with it five years' worth of my work, and most of my major lines communication with the rest of the universe.   So it's a whole entire, strange new world which greets me as I roll out of my bed these days. I'm feeling very disorientated and I'd very much like to work through my issues in the public arena, where all you kids out there can point and laugh, etc. Unfortunately it doesn't look like I'm going to be able to replace the PC anytime soon, so my blogging may be pretty sporadic for the forseeable future.  Right now I'm snatching a few quiet minutes on a very shiny school Mac (I so want one of these), but I can't see it being a regular occurrence.   Never mind. You all should have better things to do.   I'll be back.  x.
