Went for interview today...Innotrek, an outdoor camp specialist company. Went to interview for a freelance/temp/part time camp asst instructor and it went quite successfully. Shd be quite fun working in such a field. The bad point : Ad-hoc basis.....no camps = no job = no money. But it's okie lah....as long as there are a few assignments a month, i shd be able to survive. There is an instructor training camp next week and i am supposed to attend. I am looking forward to it and my first assignment should be on 10th JUNE....I repeat 10th JUNE....ur uncle here b'day...sob! sob!!...those who see this shd know what to do on 9th JUNE liao rite? Hint Hint!!! In the meantime, now got to find another part time job to sustain.   The day is not too bad. At least i did something useful today...better than yesterday. Saw a lady on the way back from innotrek on the mrt....no bad , quite chio .....she was talking on the phone and wearing some formal office wear. From the way she speaks thru the mobile phone, it seems tat someone screwed things up for her...hey!! I didn't eavesdrop okie.....she was just standing in front of me. Can see that she was very angry, yet she was able to control tone when she was speaking to her friend on the phone. Quite stylo....another thing to learn. Learning to control temper and tone. By the way...i confirm she sell IN-SOR-LAN cos she saying things on policies...must be some managerial or supevervisor level in this field.    Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
