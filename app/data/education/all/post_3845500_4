I'm going to learn to ride a motorbike.  It is something I've been thinking about now and again for some time, but towards the end of my holiday it is something I was increasingly keen on.  There was always the danger that it would be something that would just fall by the wayside, especially over the last few weeks, but I've been speaking to a training centre in Bethnal Green today and am going to see them tomorrow to get the theory test books, and look at when I can fit in my CBT and Direct Access courses.  Not sure yet if I am going to go for the full or restricted direct access, there doesn't seem to be much in the 250cc-400cc range other than motocross bikes, and that's not what I'm looking for, so I'll have a chat with them tomorrow.  If I think a CBF250 will last me a couple of years then I'll just go for the restricted course.  Otherwise I might try the full direct access and get a 500cc cycle (any suggestions apart from a CBF500?).  Since my Mum died I've been trying hard to keep it all together.  However I very nearly came undone on the way into work this morning.  Lying on the floor was the plastic container from a tray of watermelon chunks.  I know it sounds trivial, but during the latter weeks Mum was unable to eat much, watermelon was just about the only thing I saw her eat.  Still no news on the helicopter near Bario.  I have found out who was on it, and one of the local businessmen I knew, and who ends up on a number of these trips, has let me know he is OK, but that doesn't change the fact there are still seven people missing.
