I was able to actually answer some questions for people today. I got to play with the freshmen. I have lots of meetings coming up in the next few days. Classes start on Friday for me (at UMSL). Classes start for the rest of the world on Monday (UMR students).  The shower is fixed.  The washer is fixed.  I have $0.91 in my bank account.  I have a check for $56 on the way.  I'm hungry.  A guy named Dwight posted on my blog entry about sports. Right on, Dwight that I do not know.  I would like to write like Dr. Seuss one day. Maybe. I can't decide either way.  My neck is sore from sleeping funky on the bed to avoid rolling over on Mr. Lance Kitty.  I made my first call to an agency that represents a large, musical act and got....the voicemail. I left a message. It's all good. I feel important at work every once in a while.  Need to dress smart tomorrow--have to be at the directors' meeting to meet lots of new people.  Um......that's all....for now....
