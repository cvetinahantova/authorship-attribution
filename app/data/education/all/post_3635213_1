Today at about 8am I was called by Coppell ISD's human resource lady.  I GOT A JOB AT LAKESIDE ELEMENTARY AS A SECOND GRADE TEACHER!!!!!  Yea!  I will be signing my papers on June 30th at 3:00.  God really has blessed me with this job because it is perfect.  It's only 5 miles away from my apartment, there seems to be a great team of young teachers, and it's in second grade (my favorite!)  I can't wait!
