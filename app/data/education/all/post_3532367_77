I managed to get back in time for tea. The scratches on my arms were covered with the story of lending a mate some steps and getting roped into cutting down HIS conifers. We had an arrangement to pick up the kids from their Nans, where we would all meet up and have dinner, before coming home. A nice roast beef and yorkshire puds put pay to my fitness and healthy eating day.     Sandra had an early start in the morning with work, so the kids stopped over again. When we got home, Sandra went for a bath, while I sorted out my work stuff. When she came down, she asked if I wanted to go and see Shrek 2. I asked if it was a date and she shrugged her shoulders.     While she got ready, I decided on Harry Potter 3, as none of the kids would want to see it. It was a good film (predicatbly too scary for the kids) and the popcorn and coke went down well. We didn't talk a lot and held hands just once, when she felt scared of some yobs as we were leaving.
