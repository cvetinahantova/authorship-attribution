Almost everyone in this era has an agenda. I enjoy that. I enjoy the fact that I can have an agenda. I hate election years, I got a call yesterday from, yes, John Kerry, I know, of all people, he calls some 16-year-old girl in central California, but alas, I was overly excited, it was... a recording! I know! How in the world does he expect anyone to vote for him if he doesn't call every regestered Democrat in the country and beg? I remember getting a call from Ahnold the Gubenator too at election time. Explanation: my mom is a registered Democrat, and my dad is a liberal, but still, a registered Republican, whatever. My younger brother freaked out when he called, I don't think he realized that Ahnold wasn't being rude when he didn't answer my brothers persistant questions. Poor kid.        I watched an interview with Michael Moore this morning on Today. He said that he's anti-Democrat, and yet ridicules the Republican party and the Bushes. What is he? Communist? Independant? Heaven forbid, Green? Oy! I will be happy, just as long as Georgey Bush Jr. (yes I know 'George Walker Bush' is no junior) doesn't get a second term! I don't like Kerry that much either, I was really pushing for Gen. Clark, but PLEASE NO MORE BUSH!!!!! Thank You!
