My compadres nap soundly in our quiet, air conditioned, dumpy hotel.  For $25 per night, we were thrilled to have both TV and AC- that is nothing short of a miracle for central america.  I find solace in recapping this trip for you.  I am afraid to report, Montezuma has caught us all, in varying intensity.  Danilla has it the worst, while Jamie and I have only occasional sprints to the nearest bathroom.  After this day of lying around the beach, swimming in very warm, clear blue water, taking shade-breaks, sipping/guzzling fresh piña juice, and munching on homemade coconut bread bought off of a local young kid- who should be in school- we feel much better, well rested, and rehydrated.  Tonight, we´ll walk the streets of this poor carribean town in search of stomach safe dinner, cool piña coladas, and take a soothing, evening swim as the sun sets.  Tomorrow, we return to San Salvador viaa 10 hour bus ride.  Adios!
