Sigh...2nd post...not bad eh? Added a chatterbox at the side there...So..Pls do not hesitate to post anythin there..No Restrictions. Also fixed a jokes corner right below the chatterbox so that my blog won't be so dull. Sometimes the jokes are a bit lame. But bear with me alright? Anyways, woke up around 10 this morning. Lazy to get up so decided to start my Julia book. Read half of it adi. Then went to Ampang for some Yong Tau Foo. Yummy...Nice food, but the place is rather unhygienic and rowdy. Oh well.. Cant be too Choosy when it comes to food. After that went for a lil drive around Old Klang Road. No idea why. Then come home and go online till now. Freakin Hot out there!!! Aih..Damn sad at the moment. Still haven't get to watch HP3. Cinemas freakin long queue all over the place. There goes my 1st day record for the HP movies. Heard that it is quite nice this time. Pretty Hermione. All grown up. Hehehe... Got myself a lil running nose this morning. Damn irritating now. Gotta keep on blowing my nose. Nothing much for the rest of the day. Just stay at home, watch TV or go online. Gotta finish my projects. Damn lazy to do though. Argh!!! Stupid Mazura. Go and ask the exam unit to give us projects to do. Like we got nothing better to do only. Well maybe la... But still... Projects?... I rather go to the gym and embarass myself out with the treadmiller. I hope I spelt treadmiller correctly. Anyways, there seem to be a fella tryin to be Mazura on MSN as well as friendster. You guys should go check there profile out. Damn funny. Spoke to the Mazura fella on MSN. Must be a Chinese guy la. Hmm... If any of you guys know where can I find an audio player to add at my blog, lemme know alright? gtg now. Drop a word or two at my chatterbox pls... Fook out...
