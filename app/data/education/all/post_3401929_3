Well...where to start...hmm...this morning in English...I was hyper...as usual.  And then I was a bit tired the rest of the day. Quiz in Algebra...I think I did pretty well on that.  The last part, where you have to make up your own domain or whatever, really confused me for about five minutes.  Then I was like, oohh!  Ya. Homeroom...meeting about the Baltimore class trip on Tuesday...Hooters is off limits, y'all.  And...I have to be at the middle school at 5:00 am...too early for me!  Meaning, I'm going to have to get up at like, 4:15 just to get ready on time.  And of course, my dad, who wakes up at about 4:30 each morning, is going to be laughing when I don't wake up right away.  Wahoo. Ya, I was just a little bit angry about that letter that was sent out secretly...Logan has it in his blog.  http://www.rebelionaires.blogspot.com/.  Check it out, read it...especially if you have music this half of the school year.  Yeah, just a little insulting...I'm no longer going to pursue acting as a career!  So I'll just stick with the doctor, medic in the Army or Navy, or CIA career goal. Countdown- 4 days until the last day of school!
