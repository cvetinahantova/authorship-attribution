This is Chris Cooper. John Molloy and I decided to create the bastard child of giftie blogs today, and here is the result. Welcome to the Ream of Mang. This will not be any ordinary blog, mind you. This blog is for the spineless and hilarious bashing of those around us as we sit and wonder why one would suck so hard. Please enjoy as we sow our crops in the ashes of burnt-out dwellings situated in the shame of others.
