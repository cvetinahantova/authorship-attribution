marc finally came around to finishing the compilation i asked of him tonight! yay! i wish he can teach me how to burn cds though...  marco…my only brother, my pal, my worst enemy, my tormentor, and my protector...all rolled into one unique guy. would mercilessly tease me from time to time about the most mundane things! although i kind of have a feeling that he’s only doing that as a way of making  lambing .=) can appear tougher as he really is cuz of his height, size, and intimidating goatee, but he really has a softer side. one can easily tell who he’s talking to on the phone with the give-away tone of his voice. a quick thinker especially when it comes to snide remarks and funny one-liners. the family’s go-to guy with anything pertaining to computers and electronics. expert cd burner! not very expressive but you’ll see how much he cares for his loved ones with the little things he does.  pasalubong !=) looking back on how we used to fight when we were kids, i never imagined that we'd turn out to be buddies…that's why i'm so grateful for the changes...
