Frank Robinson, the former great Oriole and manager of the Expos, came out on the field on a foul-ball home run which the umpires called fair.  This is what he had to say.  "Four guys out there all saying that they saw it the same way â€”  you've got to be kidding me !" Robinson said. "Didn't any of them see it the right way? That's the key. I don't care how they saw it, all four may have seen it one way, but it wasn't right."   I about got thrown out for saying the exact same thing.  However, Robinson ended up choking himself symbolizing that the umpires choked on the call.  That's when he was thrown out of the game.
