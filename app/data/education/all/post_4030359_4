Yes, thanks to my lovely toaster oven, my brownies are now like small hockey pucks. Intending to use them for a dinner party, they are instead used as small unidentified objects ready to break teeth on command.  What in the hell happened? Well, I will tell you. I put those little f-ers in, and they were all gooey. So, I turned up the heat. (Duh! Einstein!!!) Anyway, the top of them began to burn. I took them out, scraped off the burned part and saw gooey stuff inside. I then put the rest of the mix on top of it and cooked it again. In efforts not to burn them, I took them out and allowed to cool. According to the instructions, "If you can stick a fork through the brownies and there is no sticky brownie goo on your fork, you are good to go." Well, I did that. Unfortuantely, the brownies stuck to the bottom of the glass bowl and i lost half of them in the battle to unleash them from said bowl.  Woe is me!!!!! That oven is about as good as the damn Easy Bake Oven I had when I was 10. At least it cooked the brownies/cookies throughly.  Tomorrow, instead of brownies, I will be buying something at the Seamall. I will be eating the funky brownies. I am sure they can't taste that bad, they just look like small terds.  I also learned a new word today, from my brother. It is called "foff." it means F^&* OFF. But you must put it together in efforts to have a confusing effect on people.
