Just a warning.   A mixture of the following products in a bathing/grooming situation culminates in an (apparently) unpleasant result:  Zest "Spring Blast" soap, Suave Naturals "Ocean Breeze" shampoo, Colgate "Aloe" shaving cream, AXE "Phoenix" deodorant, and Curve cologne.  I originally went with option #4 last night, but boredom and an itch to get out of the house led to option #3.    At the bar, before the place got packed and wild, I made friends (due to my basket of fries) with an "older woman" (maybe late 20s) named Jackie.  We made small talk until her friend returned from the bathroom.  Her friend sat down behind me, and without even a "hello," proceeded to wrinkle her nose and tell me, "you smell like  weed , boy."  WTF??  (I do hereby solemnly swear that I've never engaged in illegal drug use of any kind.  I don't even take whole doses of over-the-counter or prescription medication.)
