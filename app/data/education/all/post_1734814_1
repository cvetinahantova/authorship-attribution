Been home for too long. Slowly going crazy. Can't wait for this job to start (2 days) as i've exhausted all the current possibilities of our church site, running out of good arguments on most others, have sore fingers from too much guitar playing, and have finished every game on my computer and have no cash to buy more.  I could spend the time in prayer and stuff, but after an hour or so i run out of things to pray. Sounds impossible, but i find that i tend not to use the extensive vocabulary i could when praying. Just not me i guess. Most of my prayers are short and sweet and very simple. God knows what's on my mind and my heart when i pray, i don't have to verbalise evrything. Which is weird, cause i can normally be quite verbose when i choose to be, which is often. Far too fond of the sound of my own voice.  Currently have to re organise dates for ski trip. Hate skiing in school hols, but i have no real choice. Bummer. I think i've said this before somewhere. Looks like i might be invovled in a second trip too, helping run a friends trip that he's taking from his church down south. Double the skiing time. WooHoo!! Double the cost though.
