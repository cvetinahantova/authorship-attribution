Hey! How is everybody?! I'm ok...  school always stinks like pig poop though . Or  you can say it's like a vacuum . Either way, I don't like saying those things, even though they're true.  Here's my little diary from school:   Ugh... -meaning "Can I go back to bed now?"  Registration was boring. It always is. Health is going to be an easy A, if I chose to do the homework and participation stuff. That's easy though. It'll be pretty boring.  English might be ok, but probably not as good as Mrs. Bradley or Mrs. Noble .  Newspaper ROX! As always ...  A Lunch ... good. that's the way I like it. Drama might be ok, if Erica stays. There's not very many people in that class.  Drama will good for field trips... She says maybe 2 or 3. Yay! I hope it's at least 3.  Spanish will be interesting, but very stupid and corny...  I can't believe we had homework on the first day!!!!!!! That is mean and rude and horrible and terrible! She's horrible for that!  Biology might be fun.  I just hope we don't have to dissect anything, especially a baby pig! Gross!!!!!!! But I think it'll be fun anyway, especially if we get candy everyday, which probably won't happen.  Geometry is ok.  I almost had homework. I think it's going to be a boring challenging class.  I don't know if I'll like it though.   10th grade is like a vacuum. Totally.    I wanna go to the concert! It's on Friday. I can't wait!!!!    Hey Rhonda!!!!! Are you gonna be at the Slingshot 57 concert this Friday night? It's in Corydon, Indiana at the Lincoln Hills Christian Church. It'd be awesome if you could make it! See ya there! and if not, oh well.   Umm... what else should I talk about now? Hmm... I can't think of anything right now.... I'll write more later if I do think of something.   Silent   P.S. I'll leave the light on for ya! I don't know where that came from,  total randomness ....
