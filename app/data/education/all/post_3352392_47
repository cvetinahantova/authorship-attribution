urlLink    Â  urlLink   One of my intentions in starting this blog was to contribute to a public discourse that will help to oust Bush Inc. from Washington, D.C.. I hope I have succeeded, however faint the impact may have been.  Now, to complete my dissertation and find stable, long-term employment in academia, I need to take a break from blogging. Tenured positions are increasingly scarce and hard to obtain, so the task will require my full atttention.  I want to thank  urlLink Steve Bates ,  urlLink Charles 2 ,  urlLink Lujane ,  urlLink Sofarsogoo ,  urlLink wil ,  urlLink andante ,  urlLink Wanda ,  urlLink Matthea , and the others who have commented here. I still intend to visit and leave comments at your sites, from which I have learned a lot, and have every intention of resuming my own blogging regularly before the end of the year.   May the day come soon when we can all blog our hearts out in glee at the decisive removal of George Bush from our White House. And speaking of Bush, remember when he could not think of a single mistake he had made, when asked the question during a rare press conference? Well, at the very least, he can thank Michael Moore for jogging his--and the public's--memory.   Lastly, if anyone reading this is more or less new to blogging and would like a guide to the world of blogs, I recommend you start with  urlLink Steve Bates' site , which  has an excellent listing of blogs that includes descriptive text boxes for each blog. Just let your cursor hover over the individual blog titles to read the descriptions.   So, till next time, here's holding a hand up to you all in thanks and well-wishing.
