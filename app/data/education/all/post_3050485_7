i have an upset stomach. this is cool. for lacking any of other words to say i guess i am reduced to an imbicile.... which is not the first time. tonight, i will start reading the civil code. i am not really that concern too much with statutory construction, not because it is hard, but because, well, i dont have time to worry for it anymore. some of the cases in statcon seem easy to understand( save the radiola case which took me 4 times of reading before i finally got what all the fuss was all about) it is just that it seems that atty. culling  further muddles the issues when in discussion. he is good, by all means he is, it is just that does he intentionally make it appear more difficult? remember this is an opinion of a slave( err, a student) so this is not of any importance at all. i invoke my freedom of speech with this one if people are raising their eyebrows. i console myself with a sight that at least i am learning, even if this is the hard way.  To toil for the sake of learning is the price i must pay.
