If there are any readers mulling about, do forgive me for the constant drafts and revisions to a somewhat simple 'reaction' to Bates' article on restructuring universities for technological change. Am still finding my way around brevity and succintness so bear with me while I collect my thoughts.   Since this blog is primarily for my journal keeping and log, it will be a massive mess :) (that much I am sure) so readers, you have been warned!
