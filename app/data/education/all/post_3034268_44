Blogs   I'm beginning to become bored with writing blogs entries.  Lately, I have strived to become more empathetic with individuals that I come into contact with.  The blog is counterproductive towards that goal, however.  I'm thinking that I may try to avoid blogging, and take up writing letters to my family.  I'm not certain yet.  They both have their disadvantages and advantages.    Spending time in Athens (Georgia), I was able to spend a lot of time with some great professors from Barnard College, The University of Georgia, and The University of Texas, as well as some amazing students from Barnard and UG.  The quality and quantity of my conversations and classes during those four days were unmatched in my life.  I would like to strive for more depth in conversations and interactions with individuals.    Anyways, I love as good conversation.  It is my favorite past time.  If you've got something interesting to converse about, I'm all ears.
