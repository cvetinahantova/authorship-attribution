Trailblazer  is that the man that I once was who insisted on blazing new trails and not living a "what if" life?  a decade of seasons and gravity recedings have passed and I wonder where that passionate rider rode off to  these days it takes multiple attempts to kick start a heart that at one time wouldn't be tamed by words or worries  is this the fate of all trailblazers that the trails fade away to foot paths that constantly need maintaining?  it always seems  half a step away with the miles placed on this body the desire will not manifest for seeing what lies over the next horizon  perhaps too many disillusioned vistas has left my heart in comfort in place with no more adventures calling out to me  thankfully that rider never knew his fate or he might have never have set foot on that trail I'm standing on today wondering or pleading if I have one last ride left in me  Â©2003 DC Vision
