not much has changed since my last post other then i left the house with out being attacked. i went over and hung out with Phil and Heather. when i pulled into the apartments there was this guy leaning against the fence by the pool. and i swear it looked just like Brandon.. i know you guys might think i'm just paranoid lol but then when i turned again through the gate (that is always open so i kinda wonder why it's there..) my cell phone rang and it was Brandon calling me from his cell! i was sooo freaked out lol. what if he really is stalking me? i was just kidding before.. lol.   oh! since i'll probably forget to ask and i'm thinking about it now.. and i'm sure Phil will read this at some point.. do i have to knock? i kinda just come in anyway lol but i don't want to just walk in unless it's ok with you guys ya know.. the whole polite thing.. i wouldn't want to interrupt anything haha.. speaking of that.. where was our little friend tonight? or did i just not notice it..  anyway! we watched the last 10 mins or so of How To Deal and i sat there completely confused because i missed the first hour and a half.. i still want to know why it was a good idea to leave the woman in labor in the back seat while you run into the end of a wedding to get a girl.. after that we flipped back and forth between Freaky Friday and VH1s 40 Greatest Reality Moments or something close to that title.. i was more interested in the arm around me and the cute boy attached to it then i was with Jessica Simpson and her "is this chicken or tuna?" retardedness.. is retardedness a word? spell check says no! ahh who cares.. unfortunately i have these things called parents and i had to leave. Phil was nice enough to walk me to my car tho to make sure Brandon wasn't there to kidnap me.. i kinda think he had ulterior motives.. but that's just a thought hehe
