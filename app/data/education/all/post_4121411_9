During last night's episode of the Singapore Idol, there was one contestant who is a single mother. She is only 21 years old but already, her son is 2.5 years old. What really saddens me to see is that she said she chose to be a single mum. Though I do not know the actual reason why she is a single mum, but I pray that the Lord will show her mercy and grace because she has to worry about her son's education and upbringing soon.    It was the first time in a long while that I stayed at home for the whole day. Almost 2 full month since I last did that. It was a pleasant surprise to my mum.It's a surprise to me too..haha...not that it was done on purpose, but I do enjoy staying at home and resting. The work in school is really mentally tiring and exhausting, but it is not physically tiring(judging from my belly).Praise God for the rest that I got. It was quite enjoyable.   Counting down to the last month before Eileen goes to the States,I'm really getting to miss her and can't wait to spend all my time with her before she leaves, but I realised that God has placed everyone in where they are for a reason. I can only pray that God will protect her and preserve our relationship because only through Him we got together, and only by Him can we stay together.   Going to buy a walkman later for Meiling...can't seem to find a good yet affordable one. The prices are quite crazy at where I've seen them. Almost $100...hai..Hopefully I can find one that is cheap and good later...
