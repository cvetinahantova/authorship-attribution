We're going away 6th - 21st August and wondered if anyone is able to look after our kitten Dylan. You could either house-sit or he can come and stay with you. He's very friendly and fully house trained. He will be extremely appreciative, as will we. If you're able to help please get in touch.  (He is now a bit bigger than this picture but still just as cute!)
