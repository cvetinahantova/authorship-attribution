How do I spell relief?  O-N-E M-O-R-E D-A-Y.  I can hear the angels singing the hallelujah chorus as I type.  There were a lot of kids today that I couldn't wait to see walk out my classroom door for a final time.  Like the kid who flipped me the bird earlier this year.  Oh, and the kid that acts like a monkey all the time.  And, the kid who talks non-stop.  Oh, wait.  That's all of them.  But, I am trying to stay upbeat and positive through my last days.  Hey!  I saw that eye roll.  I really am.  Some of the kids have been really sweet, and I have received some very nice letters, pictures, and gifts.  I even got a gift card to Target from the kid that proclaimed in front of my class that he thought about committing suicide because people were so mean to him.  Yeah.  I said proclaimed.  He literally got up on the stage in my room and announced it.  You know that Pearl Jam song "Jeremy?"  That's what went through my head when he did it.  I have never been that scared in my own classroom.  Right.  Back to the positive.  Ummmm...  I've only had two kids fail my final so far.  Yes, they failed the theatre arts final.  It was an open-note final.  They failed it.  And, they didn't just fail it, they bombed it.  One got a 24% and the other got a 38%.  See, that's positive.  They didn't want to just fail the final, but they wanted to be the best worst test takers in the class.  Now that's ambition.    I would live to study, not study to live.
