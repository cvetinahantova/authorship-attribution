Most of you are probably wondering what this title is about and basically it is called my weekend.  First off I handed over my lab rat "Stitch" to a Miss Sara Morimoto and I am not sure how I feel about it.  Its strange to think something I called my own is now in Sara's hands.  The grad part of my weekend of was Miss Kristen Sasaki graduating from the super expensive UOP, it was nice short ceremony and good food at the little after celebration.  And the baby part... no no I am not pregnant but my friend is.  She is going to have a boy in August and I haven't seen Liz since before she knew she was expecting.  It really makes me feel old because she's only a year older than me and hasn't graduated from college yet.  Damn, life is more than I thought it would be.  Very emotional good and bad, true and false.
