Hey... Right now I'm in school and I have been thinking a lot about the future today. It was really rainy this morning to my mind is clear.  I was mostly thinking of all that I have going for me, although I still believe that my relationship with my mother is completely destroyed. I still want to get through school (including college) and then move out on my own, but I don't think I will live at home for much longer. As soon as possible I want to get a summer-time job, or an after-school job and start saving up. It will be a few years before I can actually rent an apartment because I'm still young, but I think I can survive home until then. I don't think home would be so bad if at least one person understood me there; but mom never takes my side ( because  she doesn't understand), and my sister doesn't understand me because she can never know how I feel (and because she is to wrapped up in her own little word). I mean, my dad  tries  and sometimes he is even able to understand every once and awhile, but there are certain things that I can't tell him because his standards are higher than mine. I know a lot of teens say all of this, but I just feel out of place in my home. This is a feeling that I don't think I should have to come home to, and I thought home was the one place that you can go to in order  to  feel understood? ...I don't know though, maybe I'm just a loner. I got to go though, I will type more tonight, but for now, the bell is going to ring, so Bye!
