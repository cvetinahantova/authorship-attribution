WhooHOOOOOOOOO, its poker night.  I have been needing poker night for a week now!  I know I will be the first one out, but hey, it is a honor just to get to play!    What does ameretto taste like?  I have never tried it.       My oldest found out yesterday that the neighbor girl is on birth control pills.  Boy was he excited.    Her brother told him that since her parents know she is sexually active, they took her to get the pill.  Which is a good thing.  But I wonder if she protects against diseases?  TJ was thrilled, he still thinks he has some chance with this girl.  She hasn't been down here for a few days, so I am wondering if she was just enjoying being a tease last week.  Probably.    Heavy night last night, saw my husband jealous for the first time in our entire marriage.  In fact I have always said that he didn't have  jealous bone in his body.  I guess he does now!   I am such a sap, yep that's me.  It never fails, when me and Tommy are in a deep conversation, I cry.  I can't help it, I jsut do.  In fact, I cry at stupid stuff.  My eyes have drilled a line to the "crying" part of the brain, and control it.  I can't stop the tears, they just come.  I am one of those chicks that cries at commercials.  The other day, I cried at the end of a shoot em up bang bang movie.  YOu don't cry at those movies.  I would probably cry at a horror film if I ever watched them.     boring post this morning I know, I used all my brain cells last night, can't think of anything funny or interesting to say, I'll do better later, I promise...
