I'm participating in a Walk-a-thon on September 18th. It's for a local shelter/clinic. They offer:   Free Pregnancy tests  Free Ultrasounds to women considering abortion  Free Post-abortion Bible Study and Counseling  Free Abstinence Education  Free Pregnancy Counseling (24/7)  Free Medical Services to Pregnant Women  Free Parenting Classes   Thing is, I need sponsers. You can pledge as much or as little as you like and it's tax-deductible. Payment is due when you recieve a bill. This way, you know it's not a scam. The bill comes from The Women's Center of NW Indiana in Merrillville, IN.   Please consider this. I'm trying to raise $500. If the total of all walkers reaches $30,000, the shelter will be able to purchase their own Ultrasound Machine and will not have the hospital expense. This would be a great blessing and the machine saves tons of unprotected lives. Once 99% of women have an ultrasound, hear the heartbeat and see their unborn child, they decide to have the baby and either keep it or give it up for adoption.  If you're interested in sponsering me, either reply to my post or shoot me an email at  urlLink Gual8199@yahoo.com . I'll let you know what info I need from you.   Thanks!
