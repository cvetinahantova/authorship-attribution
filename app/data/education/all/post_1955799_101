Hey, it's another day, and life is great.  Last night went fine.  Today was an "I can get up late day," as 11:10 AM came by with me in bed.  I made myself get up, so I can get dressed, and eat.  As it turned out, I didn't eat breakfast, and went to work.  Brought steak & rice for dinner.  :-)   I love a good meal.    Currently, I'm sleepy, and thoguht about going home early.  I have some compensatory hours to take, and just may do so.  I want to go to bed.      Song of The Day:    "To Your Love"    by Fionna Apple.  Why?  I love the song.  Fionna's got a way of making beautiful music and cautionary lyrics blend.  If you don't listen, you won't figure out that she's deliving a warning.
