Today I told a friend at work about the existence of the blog. I needed some feedback on how others interpreted my problems. Lets face it, the anonymity of typing it out to a website is a damned site easier than sitting face to face telling someone. They were really good about it and it was nice to get the thoughts from an "outside" source.   I also got my first comment today - horray! It's really important to me to know that people are out there who feel the same, or are able to share experiences in this way. It makes me realise I'm not alone and I am very grateful to everyone who feels able to comment.
