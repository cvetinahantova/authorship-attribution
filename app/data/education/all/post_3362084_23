Yes those things have one important thing in common, they are both Huey Lewis and the News songs. The reason I bring them up is because they are on tour currently and they are making a stop at the California State Fair on Labor Day weekend. I've already asked one of my die hard 80's friend if she'd like to join me but was hesitation. I'm superexcited about seeing them because ever since Back to the Future I've been a big fan. Call me a dork if you want but its been a big thrill for me since I read about them coming to Sacramento next month.
