My son keeps telling me that times now are different than they were when I was a kid.  He says that I don't understand how things are now.  I used to argue with him.  I am a teacher and I see kids everyday in their stressed out world.  I would trade their day for my day anytime.   But,  I got to thinking(Scary huh?), I'm comparing apples with oranges.  Sure an adults life is tougher than a kids, most people would agree with that.  But do kids today have it tougher than I did when I was fourteen?  Yeah, I have to agree that they do.  Many things are still the same especially when it comes to peer pressure.  The number of distractions that kids have to put up with today are tremendous.  My boys go from one sport right into another sport all year long.  I didn't even know what soccer was when I was fourteen.  His mother and I are constantly running them hither, thither, and yon.  Studying is more intense now than it used to be.  We are pushing kids to learn more every year.  All this said, there is nothing new here.  Kids today have it tougher, I had it tougher than my parents did when they were fourteen, and my grandkids will have it tougher than my sons do.  This is the natural course of things.  The way it has been and will always be.  So I agree that times now are different than they were when I was a kid.  I will continue to argue with him that I don't understand what it is like to be a kid.  I may be 48, but I remember what high school was like and I wouldn't go back there for winning lottery ticket!
