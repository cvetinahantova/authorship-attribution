----------------------------------------  Unexpected Day! --------------------- 2dae was e day dat was supposed 2 be boring. I did not have anytink planned at all. But e tables turned. First had breakfast wif Maira, a girl dat i met for e first tyme this morning. She was 30mins late! haha.. but she redeemed herself by treating me breakfast! Hehe.. den she went off 2 work. Seems like its over rite? Wrong! haha.. Yati den called me. Well.. met her n her friends at small mac. I was kinda excited, coz it was e first tyme meeting her also.   I prepared myself for e worst. Coz wif yati, u dunno wads gonna happen! haha.. Well.. so she was like sarcastic at first.. but later she simmered down. We went 2 watch diz movie, Bollywood Queen. Proceeding on e 2 cinema, she tugged on my sweater. Dat made me feel a lot more relaxed, coz dere was sumone 2 guide and hold me. Haha.. i so find e story lack of an original story line. Kinda boring actually, coz u can predict wads going 2 happen next. She was like entertaining me and talking and trying 2 keep me awake. Haha.. kinda cute actually. I kept looking at her when she narrates e movie 2 me. Den i got my ear pinched and my face pushed coz looked at her 2 long.. Haha.. Well.. but it was worth it.
