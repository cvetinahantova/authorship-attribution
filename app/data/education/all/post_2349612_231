boy, do i have it mastered or what?!?  algebra final in 10 hours... too bad i've managed to procrastinate for the past 10 hours... ooops 1-2pm... convinced eric that he didn't want to study yet and we should run errands 2-3pm... convinced eric that we should have one last starbucks run of the semester, and chatted about life the universe and everything over frappuccinos 3-4pm... arrived home to discover my new didgeridoo... was compelled to play it, and call friends up to play "name that sound" over the phone =) 4-5pm... made strawberry kiwi jello and a big pitcher of sweet tea... played minesweeper inbetween 5-6pm... pretended to study algebra, but ran around frequently to play with my koosh ball and write emails... chatted with my brother for half an hour 6-7pm... got way excited about the thunderstorm that passed through and rained like an inch of rain in 15 minutes, watched the clouds and hoped for a rainbow 7-8pm... dinner and more general time-wasting 8-9pm... actually studied for the better part of an hour (but shhh don't tell) 9-11pm... watched the dateline special about the end of "friends", which i enjoyed a bunch, the interviews were entertaining and the outtakes were highly amusing  so yeah, that's how to kill an afternoon lara-style... maybe i should think about studying a bit more than 45 minutes before 9am gets here... too bad my brain's quit for the semester when in theory it has 5 days to go... oops.
