Well, I officially feel huge.  Nothing fits anymore and bizarre enough, I haven't gained an oz.  Last night we decided that Arby's would be a good idea for dinner.  It wasn't.  I think I am done with fast food for at least awhile.  I seem to be having an easier time with fatigue but a tougher time with food now.  It is true what they tell you about needing to go the bathroom a lot too.  I get up in the night at least a couple of times.    Today, It is supposed to be 86 degrees here and we are going to Litchfield to watch Brittany's high school band march.  It will be very warm.  I have noticed that the heat feels warmer than it used to.  I plan to just bring a case of water and an umbrella to hopefully shade out the sun.   Mark has been wonderful about things.  I can't make dinner anymore because the smells nauseate me.  I am also not allowed to do much of the cleaning because of the product fumes. So he has been doing a lot of the things I used to do.  I can hear him right now trying to give Colin a bath. There is a lot of shuffling going on upstairs. LOL.     We went to the doctor this week for our first visit.  We met with the supervising RN Pam.  She was pretty nice.  They took my blood for tests and figured out the due date (turns out we had it off by a bit).  They had us watch a video on premature labor (ya know just in case I go into labor or something at eight weeks....) and it was very educational.  They told us we would be having the baby at St. John's hospital in Maplewood.  It seems like a nice hospital.  We will have a private room and the baby can stay with us.  There will be a second bed in the room so Mark can stay too.  The whole thing is a bit surreal at the moment.  Who knew that something the size of a grape could have such an impact on my body?    We'll post again soon.  Later.
