today i had choir and i was really tired, even after being 1 1/2 hour late...hehe...so i just had a nap, too lazy to switch the fan on so i'm sweaty now...need a bath later... anyway i went with my mum to the meeting hall to clean up, but there were ppl livin there so we played ball awhile with my bros and my mum went to talk to some leading ones...then we went to burger king, which was good coz titus' toenail was stubbed and was bleeding, so i let him read my  abarat  book byt  clive barker  who happens to be gay...but abarat is a damn good story...the pix in there are just amazing! so today there will be no song, but i will say a few words about one of my favourite singers:  Craig David . he has a great voice and has worked with  sting , plus his album,  slicker than your average,  has sold millions and has churned out six hits! here they are: 1. What's Your Flava? 2. Hidden Agenda 3. Rise and Fall 4. Spanish 5. World Filled With Love 6. You Don't Miss Your Water you would be interested to know that all but hit#6 are on my 30-Cd song collection...but hope to get  piano songs  soon! i gotta eat soon...or swim a bit maybe...but i'll will be back tomorrow!
