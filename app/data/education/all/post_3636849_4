I saw the new Harry Potter flick. It swims laps around its predecessors. Alfonso Cuaron did a splendid job in creating a better world for Harry, Hermione, and Ron. It took me a bit to adjust (the dursley's front door didn't have windows before). The direction and the acting are superb; most certain that I'll not be able to watch the first two quite the same now. Keep your eyes on Emma Watson; she's going to amount to something other than Hermione. She's got some skillful chops for such a youngster.  I've lived in North Dakota my whole life. There are a few states that I have yet to visit, and from my travels across the country I can say there is nowhere quite like home. When it rains here (it snows more than rains, so I pay more mind to the latter), everything in nature changes. Look at a tree during a shower; it is as if Da Vinci himself touched it up a little. The air is heavy and insulating. Your pantcuffs may get a bit wet, but worth the trouble. My favorite time of year is autumn, near abouts harvest. The rains come, and the leaves fall....oh the smell of it all. People pay twice as much money to live in more arid (and dare I say boring) climates like Arizona. What is exciting or fascinating about nine months of constant sunshine? It would seem more dreary that the cloudiest of days here. We are lucky BECAUSE we have for seasons; they are not a beast or burden.  Takk, bra.  c-
