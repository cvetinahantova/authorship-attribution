One Year Anniversary of the Information Literacy Land of Confusion!        Yes, it is true.  As of today, I have maintained this blog for one year.  In that time, I have over 330 posts.  Considering that over 90% of blogs die within 3 months, I am proud of this accomplishment.  I want to thank all the readers of this blog who have taken the time to e-mail me comments and site suggestions during the last year.  I appreciate your feedback.  Here is to the next year!
