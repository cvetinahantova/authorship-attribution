Got to Nate's yesterday, slept most the way then watched some of LotR: The Two Towers... Finally got there around 11, hooked up and played some games. Went to bed at 4 and woke up around 10, continued playing games... Trying to get more music, only chance for a while. Played CoD for the first time, I loved it and getting pretty close to beating it. Playing GunBound periodically, when nothing's really happening. Going to CompUSA tommorrow, dunno what I'm getting there but I'm getting something... Can't get my mind off Kat, no matter how deep into a game I am. It's a good thing ^_^. Three more days 'til I go back to Bend, gonna try to make the best out of 'em... Even though I'm kind of reluctant to now :\, wish you were here too... Going to get some more presents for my peeps, should have a good christmas when I get back. Hoping so anyways... Yeah, so drinking my Bawls... Writing in my journal, talking to Kat... She's having a really hard time, it's hard to understand her sometimes. I'll finish things up some other time, not in the mood right now...
