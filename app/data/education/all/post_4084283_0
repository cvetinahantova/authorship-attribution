I guess this is an  outrageous  way to keep a journal but doesn't hurt rite?...  EVeryday I go to school and the same thing happens.  The kids stay so HYPER n I end up wif a major head pain!  Do I take multivitamin s pescribed by a CL colleague?         However, apart from that,... I  was telling a close fren in school that I really do regret being too hard on my kids.  No homeworks,  OUT  they go.  Refuse to answer my interrogation,  OUT  they go.  Jumping up and down in my class,  OUT  they go.  He he... we are getting sadistic aren't we?   I really gotta change cos this attitude of mine s really draining even me out.  Lucky for me, my kids - 35 of em, are ever so outrageously cute! They keep me fit, fun and fab!       I miss my fiance.  I can't wait to meet him tomorrow.  I hope he fetches me from school.  Oh by the way, oral exams for P6 so... well... duty calls...       Hi to all bloggers... stay fit and strong my frens... its FRIDAY!!
