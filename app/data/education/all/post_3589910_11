Well, what can I see about this week so far, so far so good. I have no complain on my Professors and life has been great. I'll soon be getting my laptop, hopefully. That way I can do my work easily. Today I finally took English class, I must say is my second favorite so far. Its on writing, which I love, and the professor is really cool. We also have computers with internet which I can use if I finish my writing sooner or while the professor gets to the classroom. So I can check my email or even post here from there. Which is cool. Well, my life right now, you can say is practically perfect. ^^ Oh, and my oral report in humanity is on Egypt, HURRAY! YAY! YUPI! YAHOOO! LoL, yea, I LOVE Egypt. God is definitely by my side. Is really good and useful to call the angels and the guardians each and every day.  I'll find something more useful to write about.
