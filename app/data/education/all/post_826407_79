Ruth makes a very good point about emerging Church stuff and St Thomas  urlLink here  I guess you're right.  Since I wrote the stuff a few weeks ago I've had to rethink a lot of what I said, and yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff happening.  Ooh and I like your story too.  Maybe I will follow your lead when I have a bit more time.  I guess I feel like I should apologies a bit for irresponsible blogging.  Like writing here somehow gives me the right to mouth off about everything that frustrates me.  Feel like I've been a bit over indulgent.  So erm... sorry.
