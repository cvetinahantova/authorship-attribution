After a long Sunday, the thought of finishing the day with youth group  is not the greatest.  So I sit down and try to prepare and gather the  few thoughts that I have as I attempt to make something out of nothing.  Once I have gone over what we will look at, it dawns on me that i have  not prayed and asked for the guidance that I so desperately need.  So I  spend the next few moments in prayer asking God that he works in these  young peoples lives today, that he gives them the confidence to trust  each other and actually say what they really think even if it goes  against Him.  Now that i have prayed I feel slightly better and also  have an idea for how to finish the evening in prayer.  Well the group starts and everyone is chatting and we are having fun,  we then start the topic of the evening and everything just goes from  there.  It was great they were challenging each other, they were asking  each other personal question (really getting to know each other), God  had really answered my prayer.  Even at the end when I asked them to  share stuff about their families (for so many young people this is such  a raw painful subject) they all jumped at the chance.  they wrote down  real issues that they were having with their families, God was really  moving!  It was an amazing evening, the kind that really infuse you to carry on  with youth work, the glimmer of hope that reminds you that God is still  in control no matter what anyone else thinks.
