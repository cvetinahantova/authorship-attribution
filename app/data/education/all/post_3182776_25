A freakish day on public transport today.   At New Cross Gate, a driver actually  stopped his train  to let me get on! This is UNHEARD OF! London tube drivers are infamously miserable, usually because their gammy ankles are killing them after last night's squash. This guy is obviously still learning the ropes, but he quite restored my faith in humanity. Then, later, when I got off the train at London Bridge, I found a ball point pen which did not belong to me clipped to the outside of my breast pocket. How the hell did it get there? And  why?  Is there some kind of reverse pickpocket abroad in London Town? Maybe it's a terrorist pen filled to brimming with sarin nerve ink. I had better be careful. I might just keep it in the fridge for now.  Life at Asskiss has been going quite well, really, but I'm beginning to wonder if this is a good thing. All my lessons so far have been fine, which of course I'm chuffed about, but it also seems to have convinced the staff that I am some kind of teaching machine, with bionic boardmarker fingers and an in-built encyclopedia of monoprinters past and present. The pay-off came today, when mentor Alastair gave me a thinly veiled telling off after what I thought was a halfway decent lesson. He just said it was a 'a bit uninspired' or something. So the ante has well and truly been upped. Now I'm required to be Superteacher every single lesson or it's rapped knuckles all round. Maybe I should just be really crap for a few weeks so they can revise their expectations downwards, and we can start over again from scratch. It shouldn't be too hard since it seems I've already started down the quick and easy path. As we all know, once that happens, forever will it dominate my destiny...   ..But I AM off to my desk now to do resource illustrations, so perhaps there is hope for me yet.
