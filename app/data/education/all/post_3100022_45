I'm in the library again, I noticed a girl walking down the street before, she was quite pretty. On her person was a shirt with the word "mature" blazoned accross her chest.   I thought about this I looked at her and decided that she was probably not, yes a steriotypical judgment of a un-likely steriotypical person. But it did get me thinking about how we (or perhaps only I) perceive people by what is written on thier chests sometimes. You can see a geek walking down the street with "1337" written on his chest, and if you are of the same peruasion, know exactly what it means, and that he probably isn't. Sometimes you can see someone else simply with the word "lost" and know that is most likely true. But in general I think that perhaps people wear such shirts becuse they want to describe perhaps something that they want to be, or be seen as. I know for a fact though that there is no person that can be summarised absolutely in little less than novel little own a word.  Another thing I have thought about is what I want on my shirt. I personally don't think that it is very ground breaking or exiting, or anything really, its just my own thoughts, and hey you've read this far so I can guarantee that you are going to read the next last 69 words of this post to hear what I have to say anyway. If not  urlLink tell me why?    I want a tee shirt that says, "yeah like hell a few words on a tee shirt will give you any indication of who I am".
