Welly frickin' well. I just realized that this blog was created 3 days before the real site's 2 year anniversary, which is tomorrow. There's your pointless information. I pushed the anniversary last year, but this year I haven't really said jack about it. Of course, ATM, no-one really reads this anyway right now. So most of what I post here right now doesn't matter. So I'm going to try my weak HTML editing here.  Mail me!   Did that work?
