I am once again traveling.  Only for a few days though.  I made it into Philadelphia last night at around 1:30am.  I had been scheduled to arrive at  9pm.  There was delay, after delay, after delay... but I actually don't mind being in airports.  I had my computer and a book and a lot of interesting people to look at.  By then end of the trip I had even made some airport friends - funny how sometimes being in bad situations is how you have a good time getting to know people.  And this morning was very cool because I got to see Mason after not seeing him for an entire year!  Mason is my friend Steph's little boy - Steph is my friend from way back in the day, when I used to live here in PA.  I visit her every year and the last time I saw Mason he was just turning 1.  Now he is 2 and it is crazy how big he is!  And everything he says!   It is very nice to be back with Steph again.  Even though we don't see each other all the time, whenever we get back together it is like we haven't lost any time.   I do already miss Kyle and Iri.  I have to say though, last night was the best sleep I've gotton since we got Iri.  I actually slept for five hours straight!  I think I might go back to bed in a little bit here: I got up at 7am when Mason and Steph were leaving for work.  They will be gone all day and it is SO NICE to have a full day to just do whatever I want...which will be reading, sleeping, and running.  I am reading a book  Girl with a Pearl Earring  by Tracy Chevalier and am almost done.  I really like it, the simplicity of the writing is very beautiful to me.  I think I'll finish it now and then go back to bed. This is the life!
