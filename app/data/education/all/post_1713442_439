urlLink Reliability, Validity, and Authenticity in American Indian and Alaska Native Research. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Lomawaima, K. Tsianina and McCarty, Teresa L. It looks at research on American Indians in education.  From the ERIC Digest:  The constructs used by scholars across the physical, natural, and social sciences to evaluate research quality--as objective, reliable, valid, generalizable, randomized, accurate, authentic--are not value-free or apolitical. They all require the application of human judgment, which is inevitably affected by cultural norms and values (Westmeyer, 1981). Consequently, the use of these constructs to assess research focused on minority, marginalized populations requires extraordinary judgment. Such assessments must be based not only on Western notions of scientific quality but also, in the case of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), on a separate set of criteria prescribed in the interest of sovereignty. Sovereignty refers to the inherent, as well as constitutionally recognized, rights of tribes to self-government, self-determination, and self-education. Of course no contemporary polity--whether American Indian tribe or U.S. federal government--exercises unlimited sovereignty: "In the real world, sovereignty operates within constraints" (Wilkins & Lomawaima, 2001, p. 5). This Digest addresses these issues as researchers take on the challenges set forth by the "American Indian and Alaska Native Education Research Agenda" (Research Agenda Working Group, Strang, & von Glatz, 2001). The perspectives in this Digest are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the positions of the U.S. Department of Education.
