Sorry it took a while for me to post this, but if you have not heard already, Monday afternoon I placed my letter of resignation on the desk of Freshman Class Advisor Brian MacDonald's desk. In that letter (Which I will be posting in the coming days) I said that this did not come because I cannot or do not want to participate in class government, but because I feel as though my presence is not necessary. I did this to make a statement. That statement is simple: What we are working under is not a democracy, but a tyranny. I feel as though the opinions of the council don't matter. What is done, is only done out of the power of the office of the President. The president has not delegated powers all year. The president has done everything herself. Delegating powers is something that is out of my control. The current administration can be easily compared to with communist Russia. By keeping all the powers to herself, the president is slowly leading our class to a collapse.
