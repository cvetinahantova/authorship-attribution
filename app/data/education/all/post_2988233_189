I jsut talked to Savannah on the phone.  She is very weak, and has a hard time talking, but still she managed to get a weak " I wuv Gee" and make my entire day.    She talked to EJ, and Noah as well.  So I am much more relived now.    It brought tears to my eyes to hear her voice, after being so terrifed she would die for the past two days.    Thanks to everyone for lifting her up in your prayers.  I know most of you ahve never met her, and probably never will, but she is such a precious child.  YOu can tell that from her pictures.    Keep praying for her to get stronger and recover completly.
