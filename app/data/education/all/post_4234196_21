Mr. Jewett's Computer I classes are all one quarter long.  This means that in 9 weeks or so, the class will be over and a new bunch of students will be coming in to learn Computer I.  This will be about the same time that I am coming back to the classroom for full time teaching until Christmas.  Mr. Jewett has already indicated that I will be teaching these classes from the very beginning. This will be a unique opportunity, as I will be in charge of two whole classes from start to finish.  I am starting to think of how I would like to conduct these classes.  I would like to try to put together abit more of an introduction than Mr. Jewett uses for his class.  Mr. Jewett covers all of the lab rules, computer use rules and course objectives verbally, and in a fairly brief fashion.  Being the "agenda" builder that I am, I would like to be able to put together a PowerPoint presentation for the first day or so that would cover all of these issues in order.  I would also like to be able to do some demonstrations of the projects that the kids will be completing, so that they know what they will be in for during the quarter.
