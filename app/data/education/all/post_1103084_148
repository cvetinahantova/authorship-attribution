............................. shocking hypothesis .............................  haven't been blogging because:    1. front burner just firing up (beginning of a new semester) *and*  2. i really like my front burners right now -- job particularly...  and it makes me think that blogging last semester was a low cost, quickie form of escapism from the feeling that i wasn't quite so fond of my front burner.   I say that, but i know that its also true that i found it really rewarding to be in the presence of several people who i feel quite confident read regularly...  and it is to you whom i direct this quick posting.   sorry i've not been writing....  so, yeah, i guess the shocking discovery wasn't so shocking:  i'm a bit of an escapist.  or is it escaper?   I was thinking that even the act of watching the real world -- particularly inasmuch as i watch it to "escape" (which everybody does a little bit when we engage fiction, don't we?) actually matches that mythos that i was describing a few days ago.  That whole longing to escape our own particular pasts and particular dreams and start anew with a new pallette or canvas or something....  hope you're good!  peace~
