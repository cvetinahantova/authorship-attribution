Innaugural Post....just days away from George's birthday July24th.  I thought all of his friends and family could post some memories and stories of George to pass on to his future generations aka Abby, George, Marrisa, Megan, Maria, and Shawn.   My first memory of him was meeting him at Alicia's townhouse in Denver and thinking he didn't look nearly his age.
