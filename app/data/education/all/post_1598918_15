PROBLEMS WITH WEBSHOTS    urlLink Here is a reason that faculty/staff should not use the ever-popular WebShots.   This is an example of software that seems really neat, but should not be used in a work environment because of the problems that it can cause.  A few other programs that should not be found on Thomas University computers are:   urlLink KaZaA   urlLink Hotbar  (or "Hotbar Toolbar")  Xupiter (or "Xjupiter")  Gator   (or "Precision Time/Date Manager")  Comet Cursor (or "The Comet Cursor Plus")    Some of these are prime examples of SpyWare.  I will post more on SpyWare and how to remove it in the near future.
