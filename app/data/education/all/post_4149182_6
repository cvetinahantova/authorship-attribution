Well, what a boring day.      Not even any crazy weather to comment about.      Not even anything political to comment about. Well...      Ever noticed how George W. Bush looks  exactly  like a monkey? Here's proof:    - well, there would be, except the link ain't working. -      Small wonder the Yanks elected him. Err... wait, a  big  wonder. Oh yeah... he didn't even really get elected at all.      Whatever.      Worked on the StarCraft map today (Entente: Europe 1900). It's utterly painful to do, and I'm apparently one of the most patient people on the planet for being able to do it. It'll be worth it in the end, and there are  some  tangible results so far. Might post a link, sometime.      Oh yeah, and Eric Clapton is the shit. Seriously. He rocks. And rap sucks. Don't get me started on rap.      Wonder what I'm having for dinner.
