Thanks in part to last minute pleas by Ralph and Micheal Moore, (and also to the taped comments of a conservative candidate promising to tample on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms regarding gay marriage) the arch forces of evil in my country suffered a temporary set-back last night when the Liberal party was elected to a minority government.  Thanks for all your mental efforts on keeping Canada from the Conservative Jack Boot.  Anyone seen Fahrenheit 911 yet by the way? For Ian's sake I will not be posting riding by riding results for last night's elections.  Happy 25th Pete.  Brace yourself for a year of fantastical spiritual enlightenment.  25 is the year it all comes together.
