Sturbridge Yankee Workshop calls this a Shaker storage bench and charges $190 for the 41" model  Since I started reading books on furniture design, I've got into the habit of squinting closely at furniture in shops and catalogs. The item pictured at right brought to mind a question, which I posted to  urlLink rec.woodworking : "The sides have to go 'crossways' to the front and back, both for height and to hide endgrain.  So why doesn't the bench self-destruct?" The principle is that wood expands and contracts across its grain, and so you mustn't fix long grain to short grain, or else the wood will split or the joint give way.  I got this reply from Andy Dingle:  There's nothing "Shaker" about it, they're a much older design than that. It's basically a 6-board chest, without full-depth sides.  Made one myself, to keep sweaters in.  urlLink http://codesmiths.com/shed/furniture/6board.htm   Because it's nailed, not glued, it allows some movement. This "bench" version also has a lot less cross-grain width, so will have inherently less movement to worry about.   I thought it would make a good first project for the TS220.        I should wind up with something like this chest by Andy Dingle, but not so deep.    Materials list:    5 5/8x12x36" edge-glued pine laminate boards from the Big Box  2 black strap hinges  a handful of cut floorboard or masonry nails  The strap hinges and cut nails are supposed to accentuate the bench's rustic look.   Procedure (please see the link to Andy Dingle's page, above, for visual reference):    Select a board for the top and rout a 3/8" roundover on the 2 ends and the front edge.  Select a board for the ends and rip about 1/2" off it.  Cut that board in half. These are the end, or leg, pieces.  Trace the "foot" pattern onto each end piece and cut out with a jigsaw.  Select 2 boards for the sides and crosscut about 1" off both. Also, neaten up the other ends by cutting off about 1/16". Exact lengths don't matter as long as the two sides come out exactly the same.       On the table saw, cut 3/8" deep by 5/8" wide  urlLink rabbets  in the ends of both sides. (Details later.)  On the table saw, make a stopped cut for 1/4" deep by 11" long notches on both edges of both ends. Finish the notches with a hand saw.  These will receive the rabbeted side pieces and must come out the same as the width of the sides. (Details later.)  Clamp the sides to the ends, checking for square, and measure the inside width.  This will be the width of the bottom.  Rip the bottom board to width. Be sure to cut a little fat, test fit, shave it down, and test fit again, until the fit is perfect. Not  too  tight, though.  Drill undersized pilot holes for the cut nails so that they don't split the wood. (I'll let you know how this works out.)  Nail the sides to the ends, and then nail in the bottom.  Attach the top using the strap hinges.  That's it.    Next: Wiggly world
