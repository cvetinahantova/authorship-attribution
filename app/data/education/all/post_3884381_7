Well, I'm taking the plunge.  I am doing something I swore I would (or could) never do.  I started a blog. So...  Welcome to the wonderful world of my mind.  I'll give the obligatory "no one is ever going to read this but me...so why write it?  Why does it matter?"  And that could be true.  I may be typing in a vacuum only to be lost forever on the internet.  But I doubt it.    Some brave soul (like yourself) will venture into the far corners of my thoughts.  Trust me...it is a short journey.  I told one of my good friends that I was starting a blog and he couldn't have been less thrilled.  Well THAT motivated me.  But I am here anyway.   I want to thank my good friends Quile and Boone for inspiring me to do this.  You guys may never read it...but you inspire me anyway.    So until the next random thought...I bid you good weekend.
