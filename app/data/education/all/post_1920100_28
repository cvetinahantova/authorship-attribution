Well I just got home a couple of minutes ago. I would write about today but I am too tired right now and tomorrow I have to wake up early. If I have time tomorrow I will try to write. Please pray for Chrisitan's recovery and for the family. May God heal and comfort them...Amen. Well I am going to bed Blessings to all those that are already dreaming.
