Not a whole lot to say.  I'm on break now so I'll just blog for a bit.  I think my part time status might be jeapordy.  I found out yesterday one of the LIKE teachers mother's died so she will be going back to South Africa to visit and take care of whatever needs to be taken care of.  My guess is that b/c she will be gone I'll probably be filling in for her.  I didn't really know the teacher very well but she seemed nice enough and she gets my sincerest condolences.   I don't know why I'm unable to get a good nights sleep but it's really begining to bother me.  Oh well.  Not much I can do I guess.  I leave in less than two weeks anyway.  I played some Star Craft online with my friend Serd from the states.  The connection was pretty darn good considering I'm here and he's there.   Tomorrow I'll have to try and send home money again.  This will be the third time I've tried.  This is getting a little silly.  It can't be that difficult can it?  I've got all the information I should need but somehow stuff just doesn't seem to be working.  What a pain in the ass.  I really hope I get some time off next week.   Last night was a bust.  I ended up not doing anything but eating with some of the teachers I worked with and going home.  A break from the downtown nightlife isn't all bad though.  My liver could use the break.  I need to hit the gym after work today.  Lucky for me I get done at 7:30.  I love having internet at work.  I should find some more quizzes but I'm just too lazy.  I want to play some board games.
