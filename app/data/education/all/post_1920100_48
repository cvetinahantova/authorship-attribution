Mini Update!   So I got home and had dinner. I was really hungry and tired. I decided to go back to work because my healing has been going well and because I didn't want to be at home feeling sad and stressing over stuff. I also went to go sign my contract. I will tell you the details later. So I am eating dinner and watching family feud (which is a show I enjoy...and haven't seen for a looonnng time....) and then I look at the watch and I remember I have bible study with the girls today. I call my friend to have her pick me up because they live in south gate and they were like we were actually going to go visit you. I was like that's cool. So I rushed to go buy some churros and I am making some hot coffee and hot chocolate (the mex kind). I hope they enjoy it. I will try to write some more later.I have really felt loved lately. Thanks for all your prayers and for your encouragement. YOu are special to me and are in my prayers too.
