Where do you go when your faith just doesn't answer the major questions in your life?  Am I asking the wrong things? Am I looking the wrong way?   I find reassurance in the fact that Jesus seemed to encourage questions just as much as he gave certainties but I still feel vulnerable and lonely on this journey.  I guess the temptation would be to run, but that is where the crunch is.  Do I leg it from relationship with God, People and the world or do I work it out with them.  I just want to know you.
