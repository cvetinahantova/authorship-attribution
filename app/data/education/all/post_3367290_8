I have finlly completed the last step in makeing my relationship so perfect. You know it feels so perfect like we were made for wach other, i know your thinking about the age diffrence, well hate to burst everyones bubble but I had to grow up so fast a become an adult so fast that you cant really tell im so much younger then him. Besides age is just a number right. Anyways on with what ive got to say, Do you ever get the feeling when your with your special someone that even when your around them you cant seem to get close enough to them. Thats how i feel around him like i just cant breath in enough of his air.Its weird becouse when he leaves my house i can still smell the lingering of the last of his cologne, or im thinkinf about some nice he said that made me blush. Its amazing becouse ive been inlove before but never like this. I cant even descibe how i feel but i know i dont ever want to loose this feeling.   Okay now onto a whole other subject This summer Im thinking about going to stay with my best friend and my first love(her brother) but i dont know if it would be good for my relationship with my signifacent other, just in the fact that i dont want him to think im cheating on him then when i come back hes all rude to me. Witch i know he wouldnt be rude but you know what i mean in the back of his mind he would probly be wondering. Plus i dont want to do anything thats going to jepordize our relationship. I dont know how I would handle lossing him.
