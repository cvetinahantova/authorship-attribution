Jessica and I just got back from our first visit to North Suburban Family Physicians. We thought there was going to be an exam etc, but it was mostly paper work and educational. Jessica did have to give blood and she was very brave. I don't know if all of the stuff has sunk it yet, but we go a lot of papers to read through later. We also took care of most of the insurance paper work and filled out our admissions form for  urlLink the hospital . So now, when It's Timeâ„¢, we just call ahead and go right to  urlLink delivery .  Our RN Pam was really nice and I'm glad to know that she also works the phone line so we can call if we need something.  Lastly, we got a free diaper bag from Similac with a free can of formula mix, an insulated bottle pack, a coupon book, a booklet on breast feeding (interesting from a formula company) and a teeny little amount of diaper rash ointment. Let the free stuff begin!
