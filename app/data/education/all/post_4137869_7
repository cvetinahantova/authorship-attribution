Dear Journal,             I saw a commercial on depression.   “Depression takes your enjoyment out of daily ‘normal’ life.”   I’ve been depressed for so long, I don’t even know what my daily “normal” life would be like.   “Cause is unknown... Chemical imbalance in the brain...  No cure is known, but with treatment, you can work on getting back... To normal.”              Emptiness; Hopelessness; no enjoyment in anything; forced to force a smile, a laugh; forced to stay quiet when the tears want to come.  When Matthew is upset or mad at me, he tells me he hates me.  I find myself thinking:  Why not?  He has good reason, right?  I do nothing for him; I’m always irritable, I’m always yelling at him.  I can’t even get stuff for him- clothes, toys, etc...  He’s a mean kid because I’m always mean!  It’s my fault!!  Its at least ½ my fault for the way Kara is!  I know she’ll hate me a long time because of how she turned out, how she will turn out if she continues being the way she is.  The other ½ to blame is Kim.  I can’t get into all that right now though.             I can’t talk to Mama, though I really wish I could!  She listens like a mother, but I need a friend.  When I tried talking to her about Jeremy, I don’t know, something I said, she took it like we had sex, and that I was good to go for a hotel room.  I SO WASN’T!  If I was, we would have that 1st night, and I wouldn’t be so confused about a guy that I’d end up talking to her about it!!            I haven’t called Jeremy backed and, as much as I’d like to have something with him, I’m not going to call him.  Only part of the reason has to do with Mama, and her instant guessing about me.  Did you know, right after I had Matthew, Mama had the AUDACITY to ask me if I had something going on with Jeff!?!  An affair with Jeff??  EWW!  How so fucking gross!!  She never made me feel so low.  I couldn’t stand to even look at her, or Jeff, for the longest time.  I didn’t do anything, and yet I still felt guilty that I caused her to think so sickly of me!  So ill and disappointingly of me she felt.  Does she still think of me in such horrid ways, so negatively??
