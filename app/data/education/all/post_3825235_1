So, I want to know who the wise guy is in the federal government that changed all the guidelines for FAFSA???   As you can tell, I am in school,  obviously , and it used to be that you can fill out your FAFSA beginning January 1 for the next school year.  Well, now, you can't fill it out intil July 1!   So, me being the big anal-retentive nerd that I am, I logged on the morning of July 1 and filled it out.  But, now it's screwing up my application for a loan from the bank.  It turns out that I can't apply for a loan from Wells Fargo until I know how much moola I'm getting from the school.  (There's some cap on how much money you can borrow for college.)  So, I'm waiting and  waiting  and  waiting  to receive the award letter from the school.  But that screws me up in the job department because I need to quit soon if I am going to not work there next semester.  BUT, I can't quit until I know if I am going to get the money from the bank!  Would SOMEONE please let those puffy-suits in Washington, DC know that they're seriously messing things up for us students???
