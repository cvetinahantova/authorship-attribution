I guess some days I'm a writer.  Today I want to be a writer, but as I sit in the computer lab thinking about something to write, the cursor on my 'blank new document' is blinking at me in harassment.    I love Wednesdays.  Today is Thursday, but that's okay- I love Wednesdays.  On the Wednesday night, I always feel like the weekend is almost here!  It's always so exciting when the weekend comes so I can do whatever I want! lol....  Granted, I do love moments and events of the week-- it's not a negative thought, I just love the weekends.  Went to see Stepford Wives yesterday with some fellow teachers- it was pretty funny.  Makes me curious about the first Stepford Wives.  It was so great to see Maura and Jo.  We spend everyday together during the school year and then when summer begins, it's such a foreign feeling to go a week and not talk with them or gab about the goings on in our lives.  I got my planbook for next year- I'm so excited.  Being a teacher is so great.  Every year you start fresh.  New supplies, new kids, new ideas..... a clean slate.  So exciting.  I feel like such a scatterbrain today...... need to stop procrastinating.  Time to challenge that annoying, blinking cursor to a dual. (sp?)  Not sure who will win.  good music today:  Jack Johnson?  I think?  Indigo Girls and Ryan Adams.  ta ta.
