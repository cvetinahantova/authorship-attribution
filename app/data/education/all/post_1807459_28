I've had a good day.  I've decided to clear up some issues and get the ball rolling.  I decided to change the title of my blog as I think I'm a little more apt to be wild these days.  Stuff is going well.  I fell really good despite having been up since 3am.  We had a teachers meeting this morning.  I presented and received 20K for my efforts.  I talked about the games I like to play at school, kinda fun.  Lunch was pretty darn good.  We ate at my house restaurant which is around where I used to live but for whatever reason I never went there.  I was buffet with all kinds of goodies including turkey, mashed potatoes, and apple pie.  I think I'm going crazy from lack of sleep.  Screw it I'll sleep tonight, or maybe I won't, I don't know.  Fenton is loaded with games to play on his comp and I'm so ready to test them out.  That will be Sat. night.  This weekend should be good.
