Well yet again I have come to the end of a training week, thank God!  I made it through another week without going pyshco, at least not at work. LOL.  Anyway, the weekend looks promising, Finger Eleven is playing at Juanita's so that could be fun.  I also still have my free movie passes from the last weekend when the stupid power went out!! UGH.  I still want to know what happens at the end of the Manchurian Candidate!  BLAH, I heard it wasn't that great.  Anyway so I have those movie passes so I could go to a free movie.  :)  Then there is always the Cowboy to go to, I haven't been in over 2 months!! lol.  Oh and Nancy is having a party also.....  And I may end up just going shoping and then going to bed early, who knows.  Then Saturday has been claimed by Beth apparently.......lol.  Since Matthew darling will be out of town, she will be lonely.  GIRLS NIGHT.  Well hopefully, we shall see if there is anything to do........maybe Willy D's or something.  Who knows.  OK so I have about 20 minutes to kill, I hate friday's they can be soooooooooooooooo BORING.  Oh well.  I guess I will go play around on the web for a bit.  Later kids.
