well friends, after several hours of trying to get the damned image of the porch to post right, playing phone tag with  urlLink mike  and trying out two or three image hosting services, i was finally able to post a picture of our beloved porch on our virtual one. so though the band might not be in them, and though there isn't cigarette smoke wafting, or cat's meowing, it's still the porch... enjoy.
