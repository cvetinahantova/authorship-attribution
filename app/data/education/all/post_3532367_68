That's what I feel inside today. I am waiting, hoping, that Angela will come online. I miss her so much, even though she said she would not log in today. I have not slept at all, I feel totally drained and have been running on reserves for too long now. I need to know she still wants to give us a try. Sorry seems such an inadequate word a times like this, but I am - for lots of reasons.  Can't keep my eyes open....
