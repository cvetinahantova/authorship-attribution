I am working with a guy at school to create a website for my school band. We need a name, really, we are in desperate need. We are a Competitive Band, but we have no name. Oy, our school is Highlnad HS, our mascot is the Scotsmen, and the name of the actual marching band is the Royal Scots. I suggested we be the Highland High School Royal Scots Volunteer Competitive Field Marching Band (HHSRSVCFMB), but it was too long. So, I have no clue. Other ideas were, The Bloody Scots, The Last of the Scotsmen, and Highland Gourd, really, Gourd. I have no bloody clue.
