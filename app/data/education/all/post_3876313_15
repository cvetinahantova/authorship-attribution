So I am getting really excited for this first trimester to be over. For some reason the nausea has seem to come back full force. I have decided that TUMS are evil. They only make the situation worse. But enough of the complaining.  Mark brought home another freebie baby bag the other day. It was from Medtronic. It had all kinds of samples and things in it. But the best thing of all was a baby shirt that says "Future CEO" Medtronic. It is stinkin cute!!! I heard they also make baby scrubs and so we'll have to look into getting some of those for the hospital.  We go to the doctor again on Monday.  Can't wait to hear the heart beat.
