Hey what are you all doing?  I am not looking forward to going back to school.  As I am sure that you all can see from all of my earlier posts.  The days are winding down, but I still have some more to go.  BTW my archives are working without a hitch now and hold decembers posts and I have set them up to archive all the posts every month.  I may end up having to change that, but it should work out ok.  Next week my shows should be live again, those of you who watch TechTv know what I am talking about ;)!!  I just now finished rearranging the home office and it looks alot better than it did, but just something about it sticks out and I can't figure out what it is, oh well.  I have been thinking about starting up another aquarium and that had been the bulk of my research and thoughts lately.  Hopefully I will get what I want.  Nothing has happened much in my town, of course does it ever?  So I have nothing to post about that.  So I guess this is the end of my very short update and posting.  Just thought I would fill you in on what is going on, even if it isn't much.  TTYL  --Andrew
