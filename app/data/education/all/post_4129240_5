So my high school reunion is coming up - this weekend, in fact. I wasn't really planning on going, but since my parents have moved to FL I don't often have an excuse to see anyone from my hometown. In honor of the reunion, I decided to update my website.  The site was two years old, so my boyfriend and I re-did it, and that's when I decided to start a blog. I spend half my time on the Internet reading blogs, and they're just starting to treat bloggers like real journalists (more on the decline of American journalism to come), so why not?  Unfortunately this blog is just a test-run, so it's kind of boring. I promise to talk more about sex & drugs in the future....
