Last night I brewed up some iced tea using a portion of black tea and some lemony gunpowder from  Harney & Sons . So far, out of all my brewing attempts. This is my fave.  I had it once before, but loaded it down with too much of the lemony gunpowder and it was super strong.  But this is much better.  I suppose I could tinker with the proportions a little more.  I do not like sweet tea, so this is a perfect alternative for me.
