Today I am tidying up like a woman possessed.  I think it might be because I phoned the CSA to see what they have done about my application, filed two months ago, to get some money from my ex.  They just spoke to him about it today, so I might, if I'm lucky, get some money in a month or two.  And that is very frustrating.  And this adrenalin has to go somewhere.  And cleaning is more constructive than throttling the cat.
