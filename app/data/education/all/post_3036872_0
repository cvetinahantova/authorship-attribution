I know rivers.  It’s in my bones. (Not my blood, no.  Deeper.)  I've had stories handed down to me—dreams, warnings.  Some things I witnessed, myself.  Rivers are strange things.  They're beautiful, but give them time and they can cut through rock.  You may ask yourself, "Are these stories true?" Remember, the river rushes away from its origin. All it cares for is finding the sea.   ***  The Rappahannock River swallowed my uncle twenty years ago, carrying him with a ton of silt, leaves, and fish to the Atlantic Ocean.  A policeman who kept his hands clasped behind his back delivered the news: “We found his shoes and pants on the dock, so we think your husband dove in to rescue his friend.  We haven’t found his body, but the river was rough that day and the water was very cold.  We don’t have much hope.” My aunt took the news graciously, thanking the policeman and asking him inside for a cup of tea.  (Heart hammering against her ribcage.)  He declined.  She shut the door and sank to the floor.  The policemen never found his body.  Last spring my uncle's bones washed up onto the riverbank.  (Though the skull had long since been carried into the ocean.)  An old woman wandered along the river and found his bones.  The woman sang a happy song as gathered the bones up in her skirt.  “Bones a good good find, good to make crafts.” She spent weeks assembling his remains into jewelry, stringing finger and toe bones together into handsome bracelets.  Then the old woman put the jewelry for sale in her tourist shop.  She also put up a sign that claimed the necklaces were “hand-crafted with ancient fossil bones.” The occasional tourist visited her shop, ambling through dull postcards and brittle fudge.  Once, a sullen teenager bought a toe-bone brooch and wore it to prom to spite her mother, who only shopped from catalogues.  Most people walked past the bone jewelry.  My aunt, of course, never stopped searching the river all those years.  She just drifted along in a wooden rowboat, humming softly and parting waves with her palm.  She knew that, like a little boy tiring of his toys, the Rappahannock River would let my uncle go.  It was only a matter of time.  My family, we know rivers.  When my aunt arrived at the bay, she ate lunch at a restaurant overlooking the sea.  She ate grilled salmon and a piece of chocolate cake.  When her belly was full, she wandered down the street and into the old woman’s shop.  Of course she stopped at the display of bone jewelry.  After turning a necklace over and over in her hands, she decided to try it on.  It fit perfectly around her throat and she remembered the first time she made love to my uncle—camping in the Catskills, in late October.  (She kept on her hat, wool socks and gloves, on account of the cold.)  She cried and wiped her nose on her sleeve, trying not to make a scene in the tourist shop.  My aunt realized that the bones belonged to her husband.  She bought all the jewelry and went home.  (The old woman was happy to make such a profit; bones are a lucky find.) And ever since, my aunt wears the bone jewelry under her clothes, close to her skin, rattling as she walks.  I have seen them peeking out from her collars and cuffs.   ***  My mom tells the story another way.    Searchers dragged the river with huge nets, “large enough to catch a whale,” news reporters said.  Yet, seven days after my uncle drowned, the searchers still hadn’t found his body.  Distraught, my mom went to bed and prayed to Flossy, her great-grandmother.  When she talks about that night, she says: “Flossy was a fisherwoman on the Ohio River.  She knew all the creeks and pools and streams, she knew where to find the biggest trout and the sweetest water.  I knew that she could find Uncle Lee, so I prayed to her.  I remember saying, ‘Flossy, please find him and bring him home to his family.’ I kept praying and praying until I either fell asleep or crossed over, and the bed became a raft and I was floating down the river with Flossy.  She took me to a waterfall and we got onto the bank.  I asked, ‘What are we doing?’ Shushing me, she pointed back at the river and Lee was there, floating in the water.  He smiled at me, then flowed over the waterfall.  And the next morning, the searchers called up grandma and said they found Uncle Lee’s body—at the base of a waterfall.”   ***  Of course my family has other river stories.  The oldest one goes back several centuries, to an ancestor who survived a shipwreck in 1753.  Nathaniel Scott was eleven years old when he traveled down the Mississippi River, heading towards the Gulf of Mexico.  The cargo was cotton and sugar and gowns for rich ladies.  Cotton picked by the raw fingers of slaves.  Fifty-pound bags of sugar, lugged on their backs, rough fabric cutting skin.  Silk gowns ironed by women who were forced to lift their skirts for any man.  This was the precious cargo.  Sometimes nature revolts, barring ships passage—that’s why slave ships line the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  And sometimes the river revolts, bucking and braying.  Where the Mississippi flowed into the gulf, a mammoth rock reared up out of the river and struck the starboard side.  The wood planks broke readily, spitting out the nails hammered into them.  The ship sank two hours later, not far from the riverbank.  Silk gowns floated to the surface, sashaying along the waves, and the water there is sugar-sweet to this day.  Nathaniel Scott struggled his way ashore—the only one of his crew to survive the merciless Mississippi.  The plantation owners, furious over their loss of valuable goods, asked Nathaniel to give an account of the wreckage.  He told them of ship that sank too easily, of water that frothed around the heads and hands of drowning men.  He was spared because he was only a boy.    And someone had to live to bear witness.  When my mom was pregnant, she planned on naming the baby Nathaniel Scott.  “Nathaniel means a ‘gift from God,’” she said.  “It’s a good, strong name.”  During a sonogram, doctors told my parents that something was wrong with the baby.  His heart, lungs, and liver were in the wrong places.  And his brain was not forming the right way.  He would not survive for long.  Before he passed away, I dreamt of a river.  I swam through milky waters and my unborn brother paddled with me.  We tumbled and laughed, spinning through the waves.  Eventually we came to the forbidden sea, and I went ashore.  My brother thrashed in the waves, laughter followed by shrieks.  The water had turned into ammonia, and an invisible wall formed in front of me.  I couldn’t help him.  His body passed through the river and into the sea.  I was left crying onshore.   ***  Years ago, my father fell asleep as he rocked my cradle.  “In my dream, I put you in a basket and sent it downriver.  You splashed around in the water, plucking plump fish from the river, which you swallowed whole.  Then you fished out a scroll from the river, this old scroll which unraveled in your hands.  When you threw it back into the river, the water turned red—which scared the hell out of me.”  He told me this story whenever we went fishing for steelheads in the Calumet River.  Each summer we’d cast the lure, then sit on the bank and talk for hours.  (“Catching a steelhead takes patience,” he said.  “But it’s worth the wait if you catch one.  They’re huge during the summer run—some even bigger than you.”)  There wasn’t much to do besides talk, so he told me about our family history and politics and nature.  Dad also told me about his hopes for me, which always connected back to the dream.  “I think the scroll you got from the water means you were blessed.  It was a gift from the river.  You’ll do something great someday.  I know it.”  Once, when I was nine, we actually caught a steelhead.  Dad wrestled with the pole and fell backwards, but managed to reel it in.  When we got home, he put the fish on the kitchen counter.  I watched the fish gasping in the air, its fins fluttering.  I begged dad to take the fish back and release it into the river.  He refused, and I burst into tears.  “But he’s going to die.”  Dad patted me on the head.  “I know, sweetie.”  “He’s suffering!”  He reached out to hug me, but I ran upstairs to my bedroom and slammed the door.  I flung myself onto the bed, crying into the pillow.  That evening, my dad sprinkled lemon on the fish, then baked it for dinner.  I felt sick to my stomach just looking the pink flesh.  I pretended to eat some, but wrapped my bit in a napkin when he wasn’t looking.  Later, I unearthed the fish’s bones from the garbage.  Sneaking outside, I took the fish remains and buried it in the backyard.   ***  When I was a baby, my mother also had a dream about me and a river.    She never told me what happened in the dream, save that I drowned.  When I was five years old, she began to teach me how to fight the river.  For the first lesson, she rowed us out to the middle of Lake Antoine.  "This is a good place to start," she told me.  "Lakes are quiet."  Then, mom grabbed me and threw me overboard.  I screamed, swallowing water.  I thrashed around, legs kicking, arms reaching for the rowboat.  Sputtering, I cried for my mother.  The lake met every desperate breath with more water, flooding my mouth and ears and nose.  Even when my head broke the surface, water splashed into my face so that I sank, choking, breathless.  I began to struggle less and sink deeper.  I was drowning. Mom pulled me out of the water then.  Desparate to grip something, I scratched up her arms.  She tried to pull me onto her lap, but I pushed her away, coughing, sobbing.   She wrapped a blanket around me and rowed to shore.  We watched the sunset in silence.   Water nested in my eardrums, making me deaf until the following morning.   When I regained my hearing, I demanded to know why she threw me into the lake.  “You needed to feel what it’s like when water wins,” she said simply.  There were more lessons after that.  Mom taught me how to trick a river when it tries to pull you under: “The river expects you to swim to the surface for air, right? So you fool the river by diving down deeper.” I laughed when she told me this, declaring that the last thing a drowning person should do is swim deeper in the water.  That afternoon we went swimming in a fast-moving river, water churning around our heads.  Mother navigated the current with a powerful, direct breaststroke.  I met the roiling water with the crawl stroke, making splashes with each kick and reach.  However, the crawl stroke was too frenzied for the unruly river and I struggled to keep pace with mom.  The river began to pull me downwards, even as I strove to keep my head above water.  Remembering mother’s counsel, I dived down below the turbulent waves—down deep where the river is calm, where fish laze about and silt remains unstirred.  Then I rose to the surface and, peaceful, let my body follow the flow.         Mom tried to teach me how to skip stones on Copper River.  Cold water lapped at our feet as we searched the sand for skipping stones.  I found a handful of gray, pock-marked rocks; she chose flat, black ones.  “You have to flick your wrist and let the stone just roll out of your hands,” she said, skipping one across the water.  I sunk stone after stone, while she sent hers sailing along the waves.  She dumped her rocks into my cupped hands saying, “Maybe we should trade.” And she watched while each stone landed in the water with a weighty splash.  “You have to learn how to make the stones dance,” she told me, putting her hand on my shoulder.    “When you skip stones across water, the river knows you will not drown.  These stones refuse to sink, and instead skip along the water two, three, six times.  When you skip stones, the river knows you can dance over it just as easily as a heavy rock refusing to sink.”  She looked out over the churning water. “I'll be damned if I let the river take you away from me.”   ***  Years later I stood on London Bridge, gripping the railing.  The Thames wasn't poetic—it was raw, industrial.  The water was muddy.  Red planks drifted along the surface, sometimes dipping below the waves like hungry ducks.  I felt sad, watching the Thames flow.  Bridges bound the river and sidewalks manacled it.  It was an old, feeble thing brimming with two thousand years of garbage.  I wanted to offer myself to the river.  I wanted to strip off my clothes—right there, on the busy bridge—and dive in.  Let the water swell into my mouth and lungs.  Let the current tie my hair in knots.  Lay my bones to rest in the silt.  So I stood there, wringing the railing, tears on my cheeks.  But I couldn't do it.  Newspapers and schooners and ducks floated passed me on the muddy current.  Stooping down, I plucked a stone from the ground.  It was tear-shaped, gray.  Chipped on one side.  I squeezed the stone tight, whispering.  “Take it from me.  Take it all from me.”  Then, kissing the stone, I slung it at the river.  The stone skipped three times before sinking down deep into the riverbed.  Sometimes I think that stone is slowly rolling across the ocean floor, finding its way back.  And many years from now, I will stoop to pluck that same stone from the sand.  It will be lighter, smoother.  I'll smile, thinking of my aunt who, in time, wrapped up my uncle's bones and stored them in her dresser.    Then I'll send the stone dancing across the water.
