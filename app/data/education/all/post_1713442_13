urlLink Open Site  I mentioned the Wikipedia encyclopedia the other day.  The Open Site Encyclopedia is a rival volunteer encyclopedia editing community.  This one is from the same folks who bring us the Open Directory Project.  The screen even looks the same.  My guess is that this community will grow slower but ultimately have a better product.  The standards for getting in and then having worked reviewed will be higher.  And it will be hard for spammers to drop by and mess up good content.  However, this is the Open Directory Project so those people who have problems with the hierachy and politics there probably will not fit in well at Open Source.  This site bears watching.  I don't think any librarians are on board yet as I see no entry for libraries or library science.
