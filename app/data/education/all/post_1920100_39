I am just sitting here in my room taking a break from studying. I will be taking one of the last state assessments that I need to complete for my teaching credential. The test is on reading instruction. I have not had time to study so I am cramming. I started yesterday and today all day that is what I am going to do. It kind of sucks because instead of enjoying my day off I have to study. Anyway, tomorrow is the test. The test is 4 hours long. Keep me in prayer. I hope I can past it, because I don't want to pay another $134 to retake it.  Tomorrow I also have orientation for the art camp that I am going to work at. I am going to meet all the people that I will be working with for 5 weeks. I am really looking foward to working with the kids and learning new art projects, so that I can use them when I have my own classroom.  I am also thinking of my emotional side. I sometimes hate the fact that I am too sentimental.  A lot of the times I feel that I am too sentimental because I hold a lot of things inside me. I don't like to approach people with  my emotions because I don't want people to think I am taking things out of perspective or make them feel bad. I have to learn how to cope with my emotions better. Afterall everyone is human and not perfect.
