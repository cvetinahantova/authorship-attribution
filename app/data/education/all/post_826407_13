Beautiful sunny warm day.  Just been at John's stag doo.  We were pretty civilised really I thought.  On an unrelated note:  been struggling with church and mission tensions a bit.  On one hand I really want to get involved in the pioneering stuff.  Set up an emerging church cafe, or alt worship experience or something. Just so frustrated with status quo low risk church and christianity.  On the other I want to be effective and build something lasting through relationships.  And I'm committed into stuff right now and more importantly see the authority that I'm under and the need to stay within their mandate.  But does that mean that I can't be wiered and do the cool stuff too?  And where are the people to do it with?  Hmm.  Do I have to sacrifice one for the other?
