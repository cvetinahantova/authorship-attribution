Hurrah! I have finally got rid of Kazaa. After one too many virus scares, rubbish search bars and bloody pop ups, I downloaded Win MX, which, although rather dull, comes with no extra software and does what I want it to do: download a song into My Music folder. I then deleted the whole 195 MB (biggest file EVER) of Kazaa and celebrated by downloading the new Lostprophets single successfully (on Win MX) for the first time. It's not a looped file, it's not Burn Burn under a different name, it's not quiet, it's not cut short, it's not live. It's not Kazaa!! Yippee!!  Ceff x   Love was once a part but now it's disappeared...
