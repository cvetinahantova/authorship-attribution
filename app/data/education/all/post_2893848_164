Admin   Some fool was complaining about the the location of the comments.  I fiddled with the template a little.  Is that better, Fool?  ps- Fool, don't take it personally that I'm calling you fool.  I had to do  something  with this post and pretending to be ornery was the first option to occur to me.  Thanks for pointing out the glitch.  Also in Admin news: I have invited my friend Michelle, a blogger in spirit without a blog of her own, to post on here as she likes.  She is loathe to make promises, so maybe we'll be hearing from her soon, maybe not.
