ok so it's monday.. i hate mondays.. its not like i have anything to do today lol but i still dont like them. anywho. yesterday was a lot of fun. mom and i went shopping and cleaned out her van. we went to sonic and freaked out the carhop, that was funny..   so i decided inviting Phil over for dinner would be a good idea since my family really isn't all that bad (plus i wanted an excuse to see him lol), but that was before i knew my grandparents and Nick were going to be there too.. Nick is ok cuz he's retarded and fun to hang out with. but you guys know how grandma Janie is.. we hid in my room after dinner since i knew our presence in the living room would be ignored because she craves attention and gets mad when the attention is on someone else.    apparently all we missed out on was her whining about my aunt being a bitch, and how she never gets invited to anything. she was talking about not knowing that Lindsay was being baptized, which is funny because i was the only one invited to that in the first place.. she called to invite me, my aunt never called and told anyone.  that lady makes me crazy.. so anyway! Phil and i just hung out watching wrestling and Daddy Day Care. some how my stuffed animals ended up all over the floor in my room.. i don't remember why that happened but it did..   as a side note the mom comments were left at:: he seems like a really happy person which is more then i can say about...(take your pick of any of my ex's cuz i'm sure she said it lol)... ; and said that we should have him over again when it's just the 6 of us so she can talk to him and interrogate him..  i'm excited about what little she did have to say tho because normally it's things like "he's gay" or "he looks like a lephrachaun" haha i love my mom.. and she didn't say a thing about the peircings which suprised me.
