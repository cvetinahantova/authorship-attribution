We feel the same The feeling that shapes heart That’s what I used to think  Nights we spent talking on the line Hours we shared our stories Days I listened everything inside you  Everything’s changed over night  I just can’t hold the water in my eyes When I wasn’t the one you choose  I don’t know what went wrong I guess We just don’t have the same heart
