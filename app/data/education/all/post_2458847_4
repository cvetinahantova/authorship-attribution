Ah...going back to work after a good 2 week break. The perks of working at a high school where the kiddies are given near college length vacations.  As an added bonus, one of the kids a worked with (an 18 year old repeat junion) just withdrew, lightening my work load more than one can imagine.  I'm sure I'll be given 2 or 3 more students to take his place. Good times.
