So I was at the salon with my mom yesterday and we were talking about me spending a few weeks in LA with my sibs and the future. When we started talking about the future, she was mentioning how excited she was when she instilled the persuasion of the mortgage business into my brother and sister's heads and how they were going to move up here, I broke in saying how much it would suck for me to be a victim into that business because it's really something I'm not quite interested in. I always felt happier putting myself outside the norm of my family because, well... it's fucking liberating goddamit!     I mean there's that feeling of clarity that rushes to the brain and it... it feel's great. There's no other feeling I'd rather have in the world than the freedom from confusion and everything else that scatters around it. It's not as if I'm striving to be different, I'm striving to find myself who already  is  different, and when you've finally made that self-discovery, doesn't it feel liberating? Doesn't that take off 100 tons of useless meandering thoughts off your back?   Yeah, I thought so too.
