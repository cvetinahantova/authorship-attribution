This past week the five cities that make up Grosse Pointe, and a small portion of Harper Woods voted in a School Board Election. I am disgusted with the current school board. The two incumbent members to whom terms expired were Jack Ryan and Steve Mathews. Mr. Ryan stepped down taking out one of the current board members, leaving Mathews the only venerable member this year. Two open seats three candidates. Although I don't like Angela Kennedy I think she will sway with whatever is majority. Just watching the woman speak on TV, she never had her own answer, she was constantly stealing responses from the other two candidates, and she took forever to speak. Mr. Ismail on the other hand I have been very pleased with. I agree very much with his views and I think he has the best interest of the students on his mind. In the end our cause prevailed, as your parents saw what was right, and voted that way. Congrats to new board members Ahmed Ismail and Angela Kennedy. Just Five more to get rid of.
