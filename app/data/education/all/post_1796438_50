I am so bored. Once again, my boring life tale comes from school. An update of my life  1) Finished exams: So far 77.5/100 in Geography (82% overall semster) and 66% in Maths...I'm happy  2) Getting crap from people who claim to be friends because I'm going to the movies with Joel and some of his friends. No he is not my fucking boyfriend nor will he be my fucking boyfriend because I've been doing fine without one. Going to see Harry Potter so don't give a crap.  3) Everyone with a neopets account has to vote for my ixi legoIas_GreenIeaf (han_mathon_ne_chae account)  4) Life is treating me crap.  5) Nice to know that when one of you come to Perth I've got to drop everything so I can see you. Not going to happen.  That's my whinge of the week. Come back next time for "What is screwing with my mind!" hosted by me.  My final words are a quote of a radio ad in Esperance that is always played on Friday's.  "Friday's just another day"
