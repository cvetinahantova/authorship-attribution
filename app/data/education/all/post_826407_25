New Favourite Band!!!  NY Art Punk meets New Order/Happy Mondays style House/Dance.   urlLink The Rapture  are totally awesome.  New album and tour coming up.  Other Favourite new Band are my friend Ben Fuller's band "Baby Ingrid" sadly no website yet for them but if you know Ben (or maybe some of the others) then try and get them to sell you an EP.  It is amazingly eclectic yet manages to feel coherent and beautiful.  Ben says they're going to do some gigs soon so GO SEE THEM!
