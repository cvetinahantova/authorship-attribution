So, yesterday was a busy day.     Abbie and I went to lunch with friends so the kids could play together, but that was after I had taken her to a park.  Then, we came home and after I was able to (finally) clean my bathroom, we went swimming at my uncle's house.   And then , I had a wedding reception to go to, so Granny and GrandDaddy kept AbbieDabbie with them at the uncle's house so I could have fun with my co-workers.  (Thanks!)  It was fun, but tiring.   I'll tell you, Abbie slept until 8 this morning, which is not normal.  Considering that she did not get in bed until almost 11:30, one would think it is to be expected, but, oh, no!  Not from AbbieDabbie.  She usually wakes up between 7 & 7:30 as usual, even when she goes to bed late.  (Now, if it has been a few days in a row of going to bed late but still getting up at regular time, that's a different story.  Sometimes she'll sleep until 9:30 or so when that's the case.)     So, this morning we're sittin' in Granny and GrandDaddy's room, and she's trying to get the adults to add to her collection of things she has in a plastic bag.  When I tell her that I don't have anything unless she'll accept pretend stuff, she informs me that it's ok and shows me what GrandDaddy has added, two bookmarks, to her collection.  Then she says, and I quote, "Actually, he offered me a magazine, but it wouldn't fit, so I asked for something else."!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can you believe it?  Out of a 4 year-old's mouth!  I was  shocked .     Well, that was a lot of this-is-this and that-is-that, but I felt it was important to note that she is using adult vocabulary and sentence structure at 4 years, three months and one week of age (to be exact).  So, did she learn it from living with 3 grown-ups and no kiddos her whole life?  I would think so.
