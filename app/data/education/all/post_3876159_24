I know that I have written in awhile but I have just not felt up to it.  I have nothing to say that is of interest b/c I will just gripe and gripe. I have too much freakin stuff to do.   But on a side note...Before Sunset was so awesome. I really want to go back and watch Before Sunrise again.  I am so glad this fabulous movie was brought to my attention.   I wish I wasnt' so lazy. I wish I didn't procrastinate so much. My life would be considerable easier if I just did what needed to be done..and if it gets done early. Great. But no! I do my best work when I am stressed out and tired.  Like right now. What am I doing? I am procrastinating doing something at this very minute b/c I would rather ramble on and on about how I procrastinate than actually get up and do something.    I better go.   I promise once I leave this site will be the beez neez!!!! But now...now is not the time.
