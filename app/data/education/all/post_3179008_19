It's been a while. The last week of the regular school year was crazy, and yet it was very fun and satisfying. We took the kids, the ones who were safe, to a theme park. The drive was long, ooooi.  We left early in the morning and returned around 10 p.m.  The next day we were all dragging our heals.   We had a game day in our class on Thursday. Lots of fun, but lots of work keeping kids focused and positive. It was a half day.  On Friday we had a picnic; BBQ, swimming, pinata, watermelon eating contest. It was hot out.  We started the extended year on Monday. Two days of Summer.   Different students, different subjects. No smooth transition...  Haven't found my groove yet.   Not too happy with the setup at the moment... support is lacking... Kids are slacking...  not much .... pherrrt
