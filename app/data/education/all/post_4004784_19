I resigned from my job today!  I think I must be crazy! My last day at work is September 2nd - only four more weeks!  I decided to go to school full-time this year. I'll be able to get both my degrees done faster and cheaper this way. BUT the thoughts of being unemployed are scary. I have to do an internship this year, so I guess in some small way, I'll sort of feel like I'm still working.  So, this is half exciting and half scary. I'm gonna go take my mind off of my anxiety now!
