urlLink Recruiting and Retaining Rural School Administrators. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Howley, Aimee and Pendarvis, Edwina.  It reviews methods that country schools can keep their administrators.   From the ERIC Digest:  Recent research (outlined below) suggests that job pressures may be the most serious reason why school districts are finding it difficult to recruit and retain educational leaders. Always demanding of time and energy, the administrative roles of rural superintendents and principals are more complex and perhaps more stressful than ever before. In the past 25 years, administrators have had to address increasing demands for special programs, collaborative decision making, and accountability. In addition, potential for conflict with school boards and various constituencies is greater in the face of the heightened diversity of many rural communities. Long hours and relatively low salaries add to problems in recruiting and retaining new leaders for rural schools, and these problems may intensify if retirements occur at anticipated rates.    Pressure for increased programs, collaboration, and accountability. Federal and state mandates have placed many new demands on administrators. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), for example, though it has improved education for children with disabilities, adds to the complexity of school administrators' roles. According to some sources, IDEA represents a major barrier to recruiting qualified applicants (Ohio Department of Education [ODE], 2001). School reform legislation that calls for site-based governance is also perceived as making administration harder. Shared governance requires school leaders to relinquish power as well as to make use of highly developed skills in interpersonal communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution (Madsen & Hipp, 1999).
