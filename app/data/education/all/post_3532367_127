I got very little sleep last night, after talking to Angela most of the night. It seems she wants to revert back to being "just friends". Its my own fault, she wanted me to spend the weekend with her so that we weren't clock watching. A reasonable request, but one that I can't make at the moment.  I want to move out, but with everything that is going on I know I don't have the mental strength to cope with the lonely times or the low points on my own. I don't trust myself. These last few months have seen me out of character....agressive, angry and tearful. It hit home with the letters last week and I don't think I've got over that.  Today is going to be a bad day, I can tell already. I'm not in the mood and my team leader has come in and the way he is, I can tell he's going to get to me. Our day sarts at 08:30, he walked in at 08:35 and the first thing he says......"you're in early!".........arrrgh! Whats the point?  IS IT JUST ME? AM I BEING UNREASONABLE?
