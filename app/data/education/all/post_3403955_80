IT seemed to go well. I think everything worked out but I can't say that I think there were people holding back not being honest. As a group we have done so little to discover each other to build up each other I am not sure this was enough. I do believe it was a good start however. As long as everyone stays open and honest to it. Or at very least evertone learns to be quiet.
