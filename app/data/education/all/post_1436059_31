Because I am so EXTREMELY bored, I took this Pirate Name Generator test (by tea and Des):   Mallory:   urlLink My pirate name is Mad Abigail Breakes   This weekend I'm going to a work picnic or something with Heather! I don't know what its gonna be like but I haven't seen my Home Fry in so long so I don't care. I've been so bored this summer and I haven't seen my friends in ages so I can't wait. Heather says another friend of hers is going, but I don't mind that either. I don't know if I know the friend, but I probably don't 'cause she didn't say his name.  OMG that Gap commercial with Madonna and Missy Elliot is so funny! I think its hilarious. I don't like Gap at all, but I thought that pairing for a commercial was rather...odd.  Get into the groove, let me show you some moves...  LOL! I don't really like Madonna or Missy Elliot, but I still thought it was funny.  I didn't do anything remotely interesting today, so get lost if you want something interesting!
