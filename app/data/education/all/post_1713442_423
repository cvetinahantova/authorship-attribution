urlLink Effect Size and Meta-Analysis. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Carol Boston.  From the ERIC Digest:  Given the growing demand for "evidenced-based research" to guide educational interventions, interest in the research technique of meta-analysis has surged. Developed by Gene Glass in the mid-1970s, meta-analysis is a statistical technique that enables the results from a number of studies to be combined to determine the average effect of a given technique. Comparisons can then be made about the relative effectiveness of various techniques for increasing student achievement.    Where traditional literature reviews often present a narrative, chronological look at a small subset of studies deemed by an author to be relevant to the question at hand, meta-analysis is a more exacting and objective process that involves identifying, collecting, reviewing, coding, and interpreting scientific research studies. Studies are typically coded according to such categories as publication in a peer-reviewed journal, sample size and composition, control group, use of randomization, research methodology, type of intervention, and length of intervention. Study outcomes are translated to a common metric, called an effect size, to allow results to be compared.    This Digest provides a review and applications of the concepts of normal distribution, standard deviation, effect size, and translation of effect size into percentile gain foundations for the understanding of meta-analytic results. It also includes resources for further exploration.
