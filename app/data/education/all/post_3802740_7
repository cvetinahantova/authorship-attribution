I finally did it.  I finally took the plunge and bought a new vehicle.  For those of you that know me, this might come as quite a shock.  Iâ€™m one of those people that have been totally against purchasing a vehicle new and would always stress that opinion when asked.  I am not sure what came over me, but the new Tacoma just sucked me in.  I kept hearing voices in my ear telling me to purchase it.  I later came to find out that it was my wife, but nonetheless!  I have to say that I am very pleased with the purchase and will be driving this thing until the wheels fall off and no other replacement wheels can be found!
