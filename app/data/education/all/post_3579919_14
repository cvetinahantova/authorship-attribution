That's right... Its time for another weekend excursion.  Man, June was all work.. now July is hopping... and I'm only 1/2 way through.  After this weekend I will allow myself to start counting down the days until I leave.  Or, more specifically, the days until I see Jen.  I'm not eager to leave, but I sure am eager to get back...  A strange paradox.  But back to the island.  Its known as the poor man's Galapagos because it has many similar species.  Ha ha.. similar unique species?  I'm flying down with a buddy of mine, to save time.  We fly down on Friday, and back to work on Monday, after a morning flight.  It should be fun.  Stay tuned for pictures, and a story.
