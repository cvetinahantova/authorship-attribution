I wake for an hour each night, sometimes more. I cruise the net, smoke and wonder. Strangely enough this new spiritual "cycle" has gone hand in hand with a new series I ordered for the library, and a need for creative output. "Fire-Us: The Kindling" by Armstrong and Butcher has me thinking about those dreams I had so long ago.   I wouldn't call this insomnia. I don't know what to call it. I just feel directionless. Again.  Back to bed.
