For All We Know --a song sung by Donny Hathaway (I don't know if he was the original, but his version is hot!-my favorite song)      "For all we know   We may never meet again   Before you go   Make this moment sweet again   We won't say good night   Until the last minute.   I'll hold out my hand   And my heart will be in it.      For all we know   This may only be a dream.   We come, and we go   Like the ripples of a stream.   So love me, love me tonight   Tomorrow was made for some.   Tomorrow may never come,   For all we know."         This song is my absolute favorite.  I first listened to it shortly after Aaliyah died.  In one of her interviews, she said it was her favorite (I am SUCH a biter) and I decided to check it out.      I think I love this song, the way Donny sung it, because it embodies my philosophy for my life.  I just feel like I want everything here and now and I want to grab onto and possess and cherish EVERYTHING that feels good to me--or is starting to--because I never know if/when it will end.  Be it death, or even plain ol' circumstance, we don't know what can cut short the existence of all things beautiful and dear to us.  I think having this philosophy is a blessing because it allows me to pretty much never regret any of my relationships or dealings with people.  I think that I'm only bothered by the fact that so many people just don't think with this philosophy and spend so much time doing negative things (to me as well) and don't realize the fact that everything may all end before their eyes.       I treat people with love; if I do something wrong, I apologize; if I feel a certain way, I tend to let that person know--it presses you to do these things when  you listen to the truth of these lyrics.      For all I know...
