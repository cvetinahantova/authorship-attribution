Hangar plays host to hoops   By DARREN HARBAUGH Valley Press Staff Writer On Saturday, the parking lot of The Hangar, home of the JetHawks, was filled with hundreds of people of all ages playing ball. But not the kind of ball that is usually played at The Hangar. Continuing today, The Hangar plays host to the Hoop World Tournament and Festival. Sixteen basketball courts are set up, active throughout the day.  In addition to the hoops, there are also dozens of vending booths and live music. �All people are invited to participate, from ages 7-107,� said Larry Thornhill, general manager of Clear Channel, the event�s sponsor. �We wanted to bring a big basketball tournament to the Antelope Valley and provide fun for the entire family.� The tournament is made up of ten brackets covering all age groups. The winners of each bracket are invited to the national championship in Hawaii. �Whoever is sponsoring this event is doing a good job,� said 1st Sgt. Porter Jefferson from Edwards Air Force Base, who volunteered his time to referee at the event. �Look around. What don�t you see here?  There�s no beer. They could have made a lot of money with that, but this is a real athletic event. �It�s a good family atmosphere,� said Jefferson. One of the fathers in attendance was Berrell Eveland. He was cheering on his daughter Brittany, 10, who was the only girl playing in the 10-and-under boys division. �The kids are having fun. Everybody has been really friendly. It�s a real family event,� Eveland said. When asked what she thought about being the only girl in the division, Brittany grinned and said, �It feels cool.� There was only one major complaint about the tournament. �It�s been fun,� said Alberta Nora, who was part of a group of parents that had been at the tournament all day. �But I wish they had it at a different time of the year.� The high turnout despite the heat seemed to give the tournament a lasting appeal. �Everybody officiating wants to be here,� Jefferson said, �All these people out here in this heat?  It�s going to grow.� Oddly enough, with all the basketball going on the biggest crowd of the day was not for the hoops.  It was for a cheer exhibition put on by Supreme Cheer. Children off all ages performed cheer routines set to music. �This area has always been left out,� said Jefferson, �It deserves something like this. This area is growing. I�ll support this every year.� A portion of the proceeds generated by the tournament go to benefit the Antelope Valley College football program and the Antelope Valley Athletic Club.
