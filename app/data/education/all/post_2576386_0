In her latest entry,  urlLink sassy  talks about breast implants and vanity. She narrates how people are being duped by quacks for a smaller fee than if they were treated by a licensed doctor.  This sparked my memory that happened a few years back.   Two years ago, my eldest daughter, Kraiganne, who was about 16 then, was starting to have pimples.  As her mother believes that pimples can really be nasty and have lasting effects like scars in her line of the family (shhhh!), she took my daughter to the derma clinic.  When they arrived home, my wife was narrating how expensive and how tedious the procedure was.    I told them, "what's with pimples? It's part of growing up! I never had to consult with dermatologists when I started to have pimples!"  Just like it was rehearsed, they both shouted: "Kaya tingnan mo mukha mo!" Grrrr!  I wonder how my father would have reacted if I talked to him like that?  Pihado, mata ko lang ang walang latay!   Now, why am I relating this?  The point is that one does not always discipline youngsters the same way one had been subjected to. Time changes.  Do we regard children who do not say "po" or "opo" as disrespectful? Do we consider a youngster who reasons with us ingrateful?  In my opinion, gone are the days when parents used to say: "Sumagot ka!" and when you try to answer, would say, "Wag kang sasagot, bastos ka!"    As much as possible, I allow my children to reason out.  Although, sometimes, I forget this bit of knowledge and revert to how I was treated by adults. Old ways die hard, you see. Ahh, parenting is such a hard job.    Moral of the story, sometimes it would be better if you don't  try to interfere with your children's affairs. If you do, two things might happen: 1. You end up being humiliated like what happened to me, or,         2. Baka makasapak ka lang ng teen-ager. hehehe
