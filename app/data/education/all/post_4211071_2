I am soon going to wear this dress for my cousin's wedding in September... it is like next 2 weeks or less?... I will not be having my eid this year due to the circumstances that I'm having my exams on the first week of eid.. By the secon week, I'll be at home... checking some dues~ hehe... :) I'll post my other dress next... Cool aite?? *wInks*    urlLink     My new "baju kurung"...
