So Fucking Karen is out of the office today, which should give me plenty of time to look for another job. I'm cheerful, and have all of my work completed for the day already. Duke Ellington is on the stereo. Good good day.  Mum and I are argueing again. I think she's trying to save up enough money to be able to leave Mito. It scares me. I hate that things can fall apart so fucking quickly.  I completely weirded out on Monkeypants last night. I took an offhanded comment and took it to mean way more than it did. We've both been tired and grumpy lately and I think that the attitudes that we were seeing life in had a lot to do with my understanding of the statement. I think we got it all worked out. Essentially, I'm a goober.
