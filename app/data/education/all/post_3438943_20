I've been reading Blogs of some of my favorite actors and writers and such.  I've found them interesting.  I've also connected with them because I often feel I have the same types of things running through my head with no direct audience to comment to.  Since I love technology and routinely plugged in I though a blog of my own would be a great way to put all such stuff together and have it all in one place.
