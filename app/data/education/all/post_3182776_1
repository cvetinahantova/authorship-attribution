The essay thought it had beaten me this morning, but I picked myself up, dusted myself down, gritted my teeth and finished the bastard thing off like the stone-cold academic assassin that I am. Raaahhh!  Now it's sunny and I want to do fun things, but resource boards and another 2000 words on assessment are lurking in the corner making growly noises and pawing at my floorboards. Get back, I say!  Having this blog makes me feel like Doogie Howser. I wonder what happened to Neal Patrick Harris? After Starship Troopers, I mean.    Answers on a postcard, please.
