Hospice came today to make assessments of our situation. She is definitely qualified for home care, which is both good and bad. Good that we will have help, bad that she is already at the point where it appears she will need an aid 3 times a week, and a managing case nurse 2 times a week.  This is going to be a difficult road. I can already see that in the time I have left this trip not everything will be accomplished that I would like.   However, there are things that I will get to do that are much more meaningful and  supercede the things I would have liked to have gotten done. I really am lucky in that we will get to chose some things that she would especially like to do while she has the ability to do them.  Tomorrow, I will be going with Mom to see the fireworks display. How do you not cry when your Mom says she'd at least like to see fireworks one last time? By knowing that if she sees you cry, she'll cry, which is worse than almost anything else in the world.   Again, I wish I could curl up with someone nice for a while and just let myself melt into them. I know I need to count on myself, because there are things that have to be done that no one else can do for me: I have to write my papers for school, I have to clean another part of the house tomorrow so hospice can work while I'm gone, and I have to start sorting through Mom's current expenses so I know what we're dealing with, along with probably a hundred other tasks that are waiting. However, this all would be easier if I had someone in my life that would wrap their arms around me and help make it disappear, if only for a few minutes. Unfortunately, God has not chosen to bless me with that gift. I suppose it's selfish, but I can't help but wonder why.
