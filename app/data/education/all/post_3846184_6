So along with my new attitude comes a new look on the blog. The other template was just a little too fancy-dancy for me, and I really like this one much more.  My attitude change is coming along, and I'm doing my best to not constantly think about getting pregnant and having a baby. It doesn't help that I have a 3-month old nephew (my parents' first biological grandchild) and two friends from high school who are due any day now, but I'm trying hard to separate my situation from theirs.  It ain't easy, but I'm trying.  What helps but doesn't help at the same time is that I've been having step-parent issues again. If it's not one thing, it's another, but I know that our stuggles in life are supposed to make us stronger somehow, and I certainly could have it a hell of a lot worse.  I do worry about how this blended family thing weighs on my relationship with my husband, but I know we will get through the bumps in the road, since we always do. We had a big argument last night over dealing with my step-daughter's behaviors and bad habits, so it's really weighing on my mind today.  I know it all comes down to the G-word (guilt), and I think that's something we both need to work on diminishing, but God knows that's just like trying to "relax" when ttc -- easier said than done! We both have all these feelings of guilt in regard to her, and we tend to take it out on each other. Between that and trying really hard not to feel resentful, it all just gets a little overwhelming for me sometimes, and it can be hard to express that to DH without making him feel worse about it all.  I'm sure we'll talk more about it tonight and get through it. We just have to. I'm a talker, and it drives DH nuts sometimes, but we married each other with eyes open, so we'll both just have to deal!  Hmm, maybe I'll just give him a call right now. That might help. If only I could then take a nap...
