I switched browsers from Internet Explorer. I now use Mozillla Firebird.  I mainly switched because IE was crashing much too often and I heard good things about Firebird.  Firebird doesn't have nearly the amount of features, but it's is really new and much more secure. Firebird is only version 0.7 now so it should improve dramatically in the future. I am also downloading some extensions for it to add some minor features.  Anyway, if you are interested in trying out fire bird, go to  urlLink their site  and give it a shot.  It takes a lot of getting used to so don't give up on it too early.
