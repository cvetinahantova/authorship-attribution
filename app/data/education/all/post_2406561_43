Hrm, haven't had the opportunity to update in a bit, so I suppose I will update myself with the current happenings of my sordid life. Well, it's Potragent's  11th  birthday, so we're going out later today. Even though I have tennis practice, which sucks.      ___________________________________        July 17, 2004   So this is an old post I wanted to finish writing, because there's so much to say, and I have to use in my books. This took place during the course of summer school, which was so much better than last year's fiasco with Mr. Chavez. He loves to drone on and on, which thus lead to me constantly sleeping with my head up. Yup, but that's another time, another story.
