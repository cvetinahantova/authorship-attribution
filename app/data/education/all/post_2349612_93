dude, i went to sleep at 6:30am and you (probably) didn't... and then i woke up at 8:45 with the alarm i forgot to change to later, and then again at 10... today's going to be an interesting day.  on the brighter side, staying up over night allows you to run into people on IM who are either on study abroad or just living in Europe that you normally don't catch... here I am 4am working away, and here they are at 9/10am telling me about their mornings... duuuuude.  the end... i have to go to graph theory or i stayed up most of the night for nothing... then analysis party until we're done or until i crash, whatever comes first... i can't wait (that is in fact sarcasm at its most raw)
