His next book deals, in part, with the Haitian Revolution. He said today: "You can't understand Haiti today without understanding the long, bloody struggle in which that country gained its independence 200 years ago this year. It was the most extraordinary and least heralded upheaval of the Age of Revolutions: rebel slaves defeated first the French, then the British, then a new attempt to re-enslave them by Napoleon. But in their ordeal lies some of the seeds of the country's problems today."
