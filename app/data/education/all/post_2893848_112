Thank God For Ben Vereen   Holy shit,  urlLink Emmanuel Lewis is tiny .  He makes Alex Karras look like a cross between  urlLink Ditka  and the  urlLink Collosus of Rhodes .  And what was he, 30 when this picture was taken?  Note the apparent availability of   Webster    memorabilia on eBay.  And I bet you didn't know that Jerry Seinfeld has described losing his position as writer for  Webster   "as one of his most humiliating experiences."  What's with the TV Guide Headline "Television   is   a force for good in the world"?  Right.  If only we had more sitcoms about white people adopting  urlLink unusually cute black man-children , maybe we could finally get over that whole institutionalized racism thing.
