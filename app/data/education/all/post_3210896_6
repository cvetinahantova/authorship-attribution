Well it's a day for the Aflac duck here in 'Bama. It started raining as we left church last night and is still raining as of this morning. Yuck.  We were scheduled to have "Field Day" here at the school, and they didn't reschedule since it wasn't pouring rain. Some were glad, some were not. Either way, the kids love it. I didn't stay outside long. I just wanted to watch our principal get a few pies in the face as a small fund-raiser. I've done that...it's not fun!  Tonight, my brother will be getting his degree from a local college. And not very long after that, will recieve another degree. He's been working real hard on completing his education and I've got to say, I admire his hard work. I'm going to be starting up this fall.  And finally, this weekend, we're going to be visiting my wife's grand-father, who is in a nursing home. Her grand-mother passed away back in February. She's still missed by many, so going down there isn't the easiest thing.   That  folks is my not-so-exciting life for the next few days.
