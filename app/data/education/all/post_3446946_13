A recent LA Times  urlLink poll  spells trouble for W.   I'm just surprised it took this long. By reading the news daily, or perhaps looking for the subtle clues that show a pattern before it hits you on the head (the SC primary, the coziness with fundamentalist and intolerant  streams of Christianity, an inability for public speaking, cutting military personnel’s benefits), I knew W would be trouble. I’m both surprised at how dramatic our troubles are, and how much worse they could be.
