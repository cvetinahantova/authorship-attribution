Yaeka asked me (and some other pals) to think of our top 10 albums of all time. Apparently there is a recent blog trend to make these lists. I'll join the fun. Here are my top 10 (not necessarily in order):   1.  Nirvana -  Unplugged In New York       This was like the first non-top 40 pop music album I ever bought. I got it my freshman year in highschool and fell in love with it. This album marked the turning point in the kind of music I listen too and really changed my musical tastes. The last album I had bought before this one was the Body Guard Soundtrack with Whitney Houston. It was also the last album Nirvana released while Kurt Cobain was alive which I think makes it significant.   2.  Weezer -  Pinkerton       Pinkerton is definitely one of the best albums to come out of the 90's. I loved it when in came out in 97 (or was it '96?) and I still really really enjoy it. Its fun and upbeat and catchy, while still being smart. I think its a clear evolution and progression from the Blue Album which is also good and smart. Then, unfortunately Weezer became an emo band and lacked the wit and creativity captured in Pinkerton.   3. Radiohead -  OK Computer       Radiohead is probably one of the most significant bands of modern alternative music. I have to give them props - Despite their ever growing popularity they have yet to sell out. They continue to change and evolve, but I don't think they care much about what everyone else thinks, as long as they are happy with their music. I think OK Computer is their best album, and marks the transition from their earlier Brit-Rock sound to their later synthesized more ambient sound.    4. John Vanderslice -  Time Travel is Lonely      Its no secret that I think J.V. is d'bomb. While all 4 of his albums are incredibly fine pieces of musical work, Time Travel is Lonely, is by far the best. As a concept album its not overdone, in fact just listening to it, the concept is not clear unless one reads the liner notes. Including the liner-note aspect adds another interesting dimension. Its really well constructed. While there are a number of stand-out tracks, the album works best as a whole. I can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it.   5. Elliot Smith -  Either/Or       Honestly, I wish I owned/listened to more Elliot Smith albums so I could comment on Either/Or in comparison to the rest. I know its superior to X/O and Figure 8, which were both major label releases, though I cannot comment on it in comparison to his self-titled release or Roman Candle (all tracks I have heard off those albums are definitely worthy). This album, although it is very very good, makes my list more because of personal significance. I happened to buy it at a really rough time in my life, and this album spoke to me in a way no album ever has before or since. I really felt like every song could have been written by me or about me. I know that sounds really corny, but its true and makes Either/Or an important part of my list.   6. Stipplicon -  Stipplicon      Like Nirvana's Unplugged Album, Stipplicon marks another musical transition for me. The addition of Stipplicon to my CD collection marked my transition from major label "alternative" bands to indie bands. Stipplicon is definitely indie, this album was released by the band's own Pro-Anti Records. I saw them live my soph year in college and fell in love with them. They seriously rocked out. Despite their ever-changing line-up (with the obvious exception of Jack Dishel who fronts the band, and Strickly Beats who still plays drums) they never let me down. This album is a high-energy, highly-creative rock album.   7.  The Flaming Lips -  Transmissions from the satellite Heart      I first bought this album on tape when it came out my freshman year in high school. I had seen the "Turn it On" video on Alternative Nation on MTV. While "She don't use Jelly" was the most popular song on the album my favorite was ***** (Plastic Jesus). Unfortunately, Transmissions never made it to CD. I recently rediscovered it when I bought it on CD for $8 in  a used CD store. Its a shame I wasn't listening to it for all those years.    8. Pedro the Lion -  Control         I know conventional wisdom is that Control is not David Bazan's best album. I'm a big fan of it however. Though I know the concept isn't that original (modern marriage falls apart through infidelity), but the music is really really good. I think Rapture is the best song about sex ever, and Priests and Paramedics is excellent song about death and dying. I wish I could say something else smart about this album, but I really can't, I just like it a lot.    9. The Moldy Peaches -  Moldy Peaches         I often dream of being in a band, but I lack musical talent of any sort. The Moldy Peaches help me keep my dream alive. Not because they are so bad, but because they are so good. With not much more than a keyboard, a drum machine, and a few friends that can play guitars, Kimya Dawson and Adam Green constructed an album worth listening to. The songs go from inane (These Burgers) to obscene (Downloading Porn with Dave) to sugary sweet (Anyone one else). Its smart, honest, and raw.    10. Neutral Milk Hotel -  In the Aeroplane Over the Sea       Although this album came out in 1998, I only discovered it recently. That's a shame. The album is thick, intricate, dark at times, but incredibly catchy. From the first time I heard "Two Headed Boy" I was hooked. Its been nearly 6 years, I hope this isn't the last we hear from Neutral Milk Hotel. (Picking one for the 10th spot was really hard...other contenders include: Modest Mouse,  Building Nothing Out of Something ; Damien Jurado,  Rehearsals for Departure ; Death Cab for Cutie,  The Photo Album ; and 764-Hero,  Get Here and Stay .  urlLink  postCount('108636377922054389');
