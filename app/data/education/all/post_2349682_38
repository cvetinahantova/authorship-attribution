My friend Jen is in town from California! It was so good to see her and talk to her, it's a little different now that she is married but not that much. We can leave off just where we did last time. She's great, I just wish she would move here closer to us so that we can all share life together. Chad thinks it's too hot here though. Oh well, at least we are closer than Israel now.
