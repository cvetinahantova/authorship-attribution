frozen   i was moving backwards steadily fast returning home  by intercity, yester-evening  i could see in the field, the bunch of trees   running away from me  left me nothin but the freezin' breeze    [iced me within the hands of time]    i could see in the sky, the white clouds   drawning away from me  left me nothin but the freezin' shrouds    [iced me within the hands of time]     and though the sun got itself girthed, but i could still see the bright shining path down to earth, as a blessing on me     [rotterdam-denhaag-delft]
