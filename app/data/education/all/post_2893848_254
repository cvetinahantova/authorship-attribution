I was sitting outside at a Krakow cafe last week when the three women at the next table became upset.  They put their hands to their faces, one blushed, and another jumped from her chair and sprinted to catch up with a man who had passed by on the sidewalk.   He looked like a cross between Brad Pitt and that guy from  urlLink Nickelback .  The man, quite friendly, submitted to her pleas and returned with her to her friends.      To this point, I assumed that he was an exciting and perhaps long lost acquaintance.  The scene was interesting from a simple and dramatic viewpoint.  But then he was signing autographs and speaking to the women in polish.  One woman posed with him in front of another's camera-phone.  A bum, also recognizing the star, lurked patiently outside the cafe to ask for change.  And this guy, what a guy, obliged instantly.  Another detail that remains, for whatever reason, is the crumpled McDonalds back in his hand.  It seemed so mundane for a guy in leather pants, let alone a celebrity.  What's most notable about this celebrity encounter is that I was able to observe it with no recognition at all of the celebrity himself.  I had no reason to be excited by seeing him in person, so my attention was focused more on the women as much as him.  I've spotted and/or met a few celebrities in my life, and they've always disappointed me in person; physically, personally, sometimes both.  But this guy, in some paradoxical way, might as well have been Elvis back from the dead.  I felt compelled to ask for his autograph too, but decided that the possibility of him  figuring my ignorance would dash the whole point.
