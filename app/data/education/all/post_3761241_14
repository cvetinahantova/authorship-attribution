my parents just the other day decided to complain about my getting a new racket. just a racket that i bought with my own money. i fought for it, i got it, and now they don't like the idea. my dad was complaining about how spoiled i was, and when i decided to get it with the money that i had earned in some ways or another, and WITHOUT asking much for it (my paying over half of the price of the racket), they don't like the idea. honestly, i'm just chasing another dream. seems like most people understand it, but again, understandably, my parents are cautious. scared. nervous that i'm going in too deep, and i'll never get a career. tennis is dangerous. most people can't get a career off it. i play for freedom. you don't need to be concerned about anything else in tennis. you play because you play. taht's all i'm doing until i'm done. i'm just chasing a dream.
