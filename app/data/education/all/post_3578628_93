As I read these posts by Kevin, of which I have to say are EXCELLENT, not because of his view on them...but because of the way he presents them, I am noticing how much just our little group is disputing this thing over the change in currency.  I read all of your comments and there were some pretty powerful things said, which is good, thats the purpose of this thing, but is it really worth it?  Yes, Reagan, did some great things and was a VERY good man, and yes, Clinton did some great things too, but do they deserve to be on the money...maybe.  I'm kind of stuck between two of my best friends here...I agree with Kevin on some subjects, and I can agree with Josh R. on some opinions, but personally, I know you're all going to shoot me for saying this, but it doesn't really matter to me.  If they change it they had better the heck have a good reason for changing it, if they don't change it, they had better the heck have a good place to put the money that they were going to spend on changing the currency.  I'm no government/politic smart guy, I'll be the first tell you that, and sadly I never have cared much for politics because of my family upbringing, but this stuff does matter to me.  Am I going in circles?  I don't know...but I just figured I'd put my view in here to see what you all think.  To finish my thought(s) here, my opinion is that there have been several more impactful people on this country then Reagan...yes...once again..he was a good man...but other people have been good men on this land too.  Keep the currency the same, give all of the "good men" a nice little award or monument or something like that, and put the "money" to good use somewhere else.
