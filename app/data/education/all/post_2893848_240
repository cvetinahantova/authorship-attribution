Horrible by Scott  You're treading well-worn ground, Pete. Sox fans are basically trash, a quintessential example being  urlLink this asshole . Bauman's right to an extent, the Cubs are the big guys in Chicago. To use some yuppie-speak, At the end of the day, the best baseball to watch is at Wrigley Field (and that's the bottom line).   What I recommend to you is what my dad and I did when I was little: go to each park, watch a game, see how you identify with the fans and the atmosphere, and decide after that. Then at least you're not coming into this with the loaded contexts you seem to be lugging. I love the Cubs, that comes from years of support. So of course I'm bias. I'd like to see my buddy like my team. But don't like the Sox just because they're not the Cubs. From the looks of your arguments you're leaning in this slippery-slope direction.
