urlLink    I bought an Xbox this past Friday.  I picked up the limited edition Halo green one, the LAST one at my local Electronics Boutique.  It's beatiful, and I am very happy with it.  Oh, and I wrote the letter to avoid getting yelled at by my fiance, as I bought this while she was out with a friend and she then came home to find the system sitting on my lap.  Her response?  She laughed as she read the letter and gave me a kiss on the lips.  I'm the luckiest man alive.Â  urlLink
