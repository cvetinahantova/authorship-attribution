Last night, the wife and I were invited to a dinner hosted by long time friend Lolit Valerio, who is sister to my college buddy Lynne Sanchez. I remember celebrating Christmas with them, eating lunch, going to Bulacan for lunch,  and all that bumming around while working on our plates for fine arts. Lynne, the ever liberated college kid drove to school on her motorbike,(not a very usual site those days) would borrow her sister's car so we can drive around town.   Last night, we celebrated the graduation of Dondi, Lolit's eldest son, for having completed Legal Management at DLSU.  We were joined by her other children Alvin and Irish.  Alvin is now at UST taking up medicine and Irish is graduating from high school at San Agustin.    What is the point of my blog besides congratulating a friend? I think it is the prospect of seeing her child finish schooling and taking up a career.  My idea of parenting is that of preparing children to face the real world.  I tend to pity children whose parents let them grow with nannies who will always be there at their beck and call. Most often than not, they end up spoiled and can't make decisions by themselves. During my early years as a teacher, I asked a student to turn off the lights. He wouldn't budge and as I was about to be pissed off, I began to realize from his reactions he didn't know how.  I swear, this is so true! It was confirmed later on by his classmates.   Anyway, I think I digress, as I am wont to do all the time.  The point I'm trying to make is that I am looking forward to seeing my kids graduate from school whatever the cost is.  God help me but I hope me and the wife manage to do this without anymore hassles than there already are.  So, in the meantime, Rey and Lolit, I salute you.
