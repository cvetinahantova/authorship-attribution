We can now officially call ourselves homeowners!  We closed yesterday and everything worked out.   There was one small glitch - we thought we'd be able to move in right after closing and it turns out the homeowners can't be out until June 24th, so we have nine more days until we can get in.  It actually works out even better this way because the homeowners are paying us rent for everyday they stay in the house. Also this way we can get everything packed up and moved in on the same day since I have so much time to pack still.  We are scheduling Saturday, June 26th, as our moving day. Anyone who wants to help come on over!  Also, anyone who is moving and needs a real estate agent and mortage person, go through Lon and Rebekah McCracken (unless my dad moves here and has his real estate license, then you could go through him too!).  They were excellent to work with and SO MUCH FUN!  They made what could have been a very painful process painless.  If you need their numbers I have them.  And here is the link to some pictures of the house http://homepage.mac.com/kranzoky/PhotoAlbum1.html  Keep in mind that all the stuff in the house is the homeowners.   We plan on painting quite a few of the rooms and putting in wood floors through the entire first floor.
