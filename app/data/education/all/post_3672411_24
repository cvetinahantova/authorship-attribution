One day left. I still haven't tackled last minute packing yet. Will  have  to reduce the weight of my larger suitcase tomorrow morning.  Had what will be the last  urlLink dim sum  with my family for a long time this morning. It was so tasty I ate the leftovers for dinner tonight.  Here's to hoping for the best and half-expecting the worst!
