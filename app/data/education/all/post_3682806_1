Have you ever felt like you've been born into a society in which you have had no say in the regulations? It's true. Unless American people all gathered together every couple of years and had an open floor to anyone with suggestions for social norms, we are living out the dreams and ideas of our ancestors with little say in the foundations of what we are all about.        For instance... Why is it illegal to be nude?  Every other animal on the face of the planet exists in the fashion in which it was born. Except humans. When you break down the situation it sounds quite amazing:   You are born with a body. You are required to wear clothing to cover up your body. Unless you are within the walls of a building which you own(in a place where the public eye cannot see you), or a building that a  willing  friend owns, you cannot be naked. If you appear naked in a place where a public person can view your nakedness you will be detained by other humans (police) and taken into a cage where you will be locked up or let go with a penalty by means of financial payment.    Think about it. You may not want people to see you naked because you have grown up in a society that has taught you not to share your natural appearance with the general public, but wether or not you desire to, you can't. You are required to cover certain parts of your body while in public. Think about that statement: "You Are Required To Cover Certain Parts OF Your Body In Public"    Wasn't that a huge complaint about middle eastern societies? " They are un-humanitarian because they require their women to cover their faces in public " wasn't the United States of America going to free these Afghanistan women from their social bondage of having to be covered. What's the difference between this and America's outlaw of nipples, penis', butt cheeks, and vaginas? Are you going to tell me that America drew the lines of restriction at the exact appropriate place? That would be so ignorant and ethnocentric.     Let's take the time to actually think things through so that we may avoid future hippocracy.
