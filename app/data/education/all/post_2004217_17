Tuesday, Week 1: Most. Lessons.  Ever.  3-3!- lessons PLUS conversation... how I managed 5 lessons a day when I was a teenie greenie I will never know. I recently worked out that I have not had 5 lessons a day every day for nearly 4 years, due to my (cunning) choice of Private Study instead of an actual GCSE. Mwahahaha.  Today's interesting act of the day included sending an "I want your body"-type text to GAZ and Coz- No reply from Gaz and much confusion from Coz: "what the fuk ? lol" being the abbreviated version. Kat told Liz that I wanted GAZ- which is really quite untrue, I did not want him, I was just... considering options! And now Liz thinks I fancy GAZ, EVERYONE thinks I fancy DRAPER and I don't know what to think. *dies* Everyone wants to know what's happening in my love life and I just want it all to go away- I could hear either Loz or Chris Devy (or both) shouting "Where's Uta?" at me down the street- as IF I'd know! And then he was at the bus stop, and I just didn't know WHAT to do, but Helen provided much-needed support and in the end nothing occurred. Arrrrgggghhhhhh MEN!  Ceff x   By sharing these things I rip my heart out
