today was super good. =)  (1) woke up early and drove to philly to hang with jessica  (2) we drove down into town and wandered through the italian market for a bit... i got 2 super cool ginger-lime scented candles,... this makes me happy =)  (3) wandered down south street to penn's landing, waved at the boats and at the river  (4) wandered back up south street to the market, and bought books at a used book store, quality pasta and fresh veggies from the market stands, and each got a requisite cup of gelato (i wanna go back to europe... =P)  (5) drove our stuff back to jessica's place, collapsed for a bit, chatted for a bit, then watched "brother bear"  (6) cooked up all our spiffy stuff into one awesome dinner =) (mushroom stuffed pastas (forget the name, but like mini raviolis), spinach fettuccini, marinara sauce, portabello mushrooms, and zuchinni for the main stuff... salad with blue cheese vinagrette besides -- fantastic!)  (7) went out to the theater to see "the ladykillers" which we both enjoyed quite a bit. =)  (8) went back to jessica's and collapsed again for a bit and chatted some more  (9) drove back home and got in around 12:30  now, mass email time and then time for sleep!  later dudes =)
