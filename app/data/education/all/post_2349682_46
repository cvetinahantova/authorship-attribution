I got thrown in the pool tonight for the first time! I know I know it's against the rules to throw Cela in but it happened thanks to Jonathan and Abraham. 6 times between the two of them I went in clothes and everything. The funny thing is I brought a swimsuit but I never got to put it on. Ben didn't even save me, I was horrified. :) Luckily though Jonathan and Abraham didn't just throw me in like any other person I was gently thrown in. Nice of them, huh? After the fifth time I was like, "Stop picking of the easiest person to throw in!" I think I actually kicked someone in the face. It was weird because although I don't like getting thrown in it made me feel like one of them in a way, like I am not left out anymore. So that was cool and I got a chance to talk to Gracie and her friend coming in and out of the pool. Bonding time with the youth, how awesome is that?! And afterwards when the dj was playing his music I got some of the kids to do the cha cha slide with me, and the other great dances that I love. Gracie, Abraham, and one of their friends all ran up to the front when the Macarena came on and were like, "come on Cela let's go!" hee hee. I feel so loved. So there is my story funny but it has an awesome ending.
