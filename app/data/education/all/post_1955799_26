This is what I should have posted yesterday:  I'm finishing up my homework, which is due on Tuesday.  I'm making web pages, which turns out to be harder than one expects, as a novice.  I have pratical knowldge, but I'm getting better.  Had to e-mail professor as to a question about codes.  I'll make arrangements to finish the work if I get a response by tomorrow, or Monday.    Have to go to grocery store.  I have to cook tonight.  I really don't want to, but what chjoice do I have I want to eat, after all.  LOL.  I also gotta put gas in the car.  It's on a quarter tank, but I'd like for it to be a little higher.  You know what I mean?
