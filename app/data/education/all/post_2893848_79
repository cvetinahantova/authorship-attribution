"Death to tyrants."             by  A Better Mousetrap   Sometimes when I think about the words John Wilkes Booth proclaimed upon shooting Abe Lincoln in the head, I get a little sad. Abe was no tyrant in the coiteries of that era. Most of the time I don't have to deal with divergent opinions; I've sort of prepared for this by surrounding myself with like-minded friends. We all like the movies that we're supposed to, for instance, "Lost in Translation." But occasionally one of these friends will surprise me. They will say something like "Hey man, I don't respect gay marriage. I don't respect anything irritating." So then, by no real conviction, I'm forced to confront this.
