It's nice to be back in the theater.   The other day, after 2 months of rehearsals, I finally remembered why I like being on a stage.  Acting is a thrilling art.  You get the chance to ignore all your inhibitions for a few hours, and just follow what your gut says.  Hell, if I had the talent, I'd consider being an actor, like my brother...  That is, if it weren't for the other actors.  There are four actors in my play (The Goat, by Edward Albee): My friend Zoe, who is an amazing actress and an amazing person to boot.  But the other two... oooooooh the other two.  Some people just need to die and start over.  That's the best way to put it.   The pompousness, the arrogance, the facades, the lies, the impenitrable ego, etc etc... I cannot begin to tell you how remarkably oblivious they can be when it comes down to acknowledging reality.    Have you ever heard someone say something SOOOO incredibly absurd that you just stand there for a few seconds, your mouth hanging in disbelief, and then feel compelled to slap them upside the head, grab them by the shoulders and while vigorously shaking them with the utmost sincerity, scream, "What the hell is the matter with you!?"  You have?  Well, take that situation, duplicate it a few dozen times, and line them up one after another. And then you'll know what it's like to spend 30 minutes with these two.  Thank God I know people like my brothers, sister, Zoe, Sarah, Shawn, etc to assure me that not all actors are that thick.
