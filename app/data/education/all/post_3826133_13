The H*Factor called last night.  Awkward, but friendly.  I feel much better.  Christabelle broke up with Josh.  *FINALLY*  Lunch today with Leeroy and Bobbie Jo.         Advocatus Diaboli has been reading your site, Seester dear.  He gives you props for being     so imaginative and clever!  What a wicked sense of humour!  I can definately see why you're friends with her! I asked Monkeypants last night if maybe we couldn't live together.  Or at least share stuff.  He rather likes this idea as well, so now I just have to speak to my parents about it.  They're going to go apeshit, but I can just move out of the house.  (Right, as though I've got the courage to talk to them, much less tell them that I'm moving out of the house they just helped me buy...)  *sigh*  Expecting calls back today from all of the jobs I've been applying for.  I have a wonderful house that Monkeypants is desiging for me, but I'm going to have to show him what a coffee shop details.  He had no kitchen or bar.  silly man.  :)
