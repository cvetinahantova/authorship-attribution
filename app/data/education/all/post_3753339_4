I think I wrote her a good response though.  As is often the case when I am worried or concerned for someone, my productivity goes down.  I wrote fiction before I read Mom's email.  I'm sitting here and I desperately want a Coke, but I know I should refrain, because I ought to go to bed as early as possible tonight so that I can get up and run, lift and shower before I go to Mass (I'll be writing more about Mass and things related tomorrow, I'll bet).  I'm actually going to check out the Mass listings of other churches in town, so we'll see how that goes.  The things I  need  to do tomorrow are grade, clean up the room, and start poking around for Margot's present.  I have received many emails from my undergrads over the weekend--I need to have some of my fellow graduate students review my assignment guidelines to see if they could be clearer (or to the point, are they unclear?), because I have received a lot of requests for clarification on things I thought were clear (then again, I wrote the things, so one would hope I understand them).  I hope to hear from Aaron tomorrow, as I believe he will be back from his vacation with his grandparents.  I should give Margot a call as well to see when she is getting in from NC.  I also need to look around my room for my key card, as it has gone missing (I fear I lent it to someone, but I hope that is not the case).
