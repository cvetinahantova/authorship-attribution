urlLink Professional Development: Leading Organizational Change in Community Colleges. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Stefanie Stern.  From the ERIC Digest:  During the last few decades, professional development programs at many community colleges have evolved into dynamic forces creating institutional change by design. Comprehensive and powerful professional development programs have emerged that are no longer solely employee-centered outlets for individual improvement. Contemporary programs typically include all employees, recognizing that classified staff, counselors, administrators, college leaders, and faculty play significant roles in the shaping of the organization. Professional development itself focuses on topics specific to employee classification, but also examines issues facing the college as a whole. New goals of professional development are twofold: (1) to provide in-service training to all employee groups in a college, keeping in mind the challenges in reaching all employees, and (2) to enhance the broader mission and goals of the institution. The combination of the two is leading to substantive organizational change within community colleges.   This Digest, drawn from "Enhancing Community Colleges Through Professional Development" (New Directions for Community Colleges, Winter 2002), reviews the context for the professional development movement today, describes programs that have utilized new formats for delivery, and demonstrates the impact professional development can make in addressing institutional needs.
