Bon voyage, Pierre et sa petite amie  by Drew  The big man's headed to the Old World.    I'm smirking at the thought of Pete crammed into a Smartcar, Pete towering over a bustling mob of ruddy-faced locals.  Also, a word of warning:  don't even try to speak a Slavic language.  There's only one word you need:  "Angliski?"  You will be missed.  And I will try to post, as work is getting lighter soon.  Hope you and the little lady have a wicked good time.
