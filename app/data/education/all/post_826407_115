you must go and see " urlLink Lost in Translation " it is amazing.  The film makes you understand the feeling of alienation and otherness of a differen culture extremeley well.  Its about lots of things, feeling stuck, feeling alone, finding someone who might help you and commitment...and the soundtrack is great too.    Went to look at our first house in Hillsborough today.  First step!
