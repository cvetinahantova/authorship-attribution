For once the critics were right.  "Pirates of the Carribbean" is a rolicking good jaunt through the Carribbean with a ghost ship manned by an undead crew, a stone crypt of cursed gold, the most entertaining pirate captain since "Cutthroat Island", and enough special effects to thrill the most jaded audience.  Scenes and characters from the Disney ride are recreated with eerie authenticity, to the point that future historians may well find themselves arguing over which came first.  If you can only make it to one movie this summer, see Pirates.
