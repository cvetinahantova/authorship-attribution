Yesterday too tired, neber blog. Just came back from Maris Stella campfire. Starting to participate more and more in camp fires liao. I've built my first successful camp fire. It burnt quite well.....hahaha....too well to be exact. The Camp Fire leaders had to stdby a bucket of water cos the fire is burning very strongly. Luckily neber get to use the water on the fire. Instead, the bucket of water was splashed onto some unsuspecting participants during one of the activity.   Finally had a day after working for 6 full days. Really enjoyed this break cos i literally slacked the whole day at home. Woke up, Eat , SLeep , Wake up , Eat.....going to sleep soon. Looking forward to my next camp on the 10th...not sure which sch it will be yet....hey it is the 10TH!!! Remember!!! I am born on the 10th JUNE!!!! It is the 10th JUNE!! ....hahahahaha.........  Koonz....  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
