Needless to say it was a very long time before we made it to Christophers studio apartment.  A good 10 hours 35 minutes on the plane, 4 trains ranging from 20 - 70 minutes a piece and a short taxi ride - boom were there.  As the plane lands on Osaka I think "oh its soo pretty, look at all of the green."  But when I go on the 3 rd train ride, I see all the high-rise buildings, neon signs and very fuel efficient cars I have a slightly different view.  Reminds me so much of Japantown SF and Little Tokyo in LA.  Don't get me wrong I am sooo happy to be here, its just I guess I imagined the lush green lands and large mountains.  After being awake for 28 hours of being up and eating lots of meat at Korean place, finally passed out on a couch that is probably 2/3 the length of me.  Today is the end of day two and Chris, Jen, Matt and myself have basically shopped and of course ate and drank- and I mean drank. I drank so much that I even had to go outside for fresh air.  Although going outside in Japan this time of year doesn't help because it is so humid, warm and raining.  The good thing is that getting sick low point of the whole trip so everything else is going to be downhill from here.  Sayonara all!
