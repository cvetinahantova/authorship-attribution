Looks like my internet isn't freaking out anymore. It's been really slow for the past two days, and I couldn't connect to anything. Anyway, I'm fixing my power supply problem right now, and I have a secret project going right now. It'll be very cool.  Anywho, I think I'm going to unplug pretty soon and work on the power problem.
