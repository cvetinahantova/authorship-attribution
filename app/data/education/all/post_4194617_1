The Oregon Zoo, to which my lovely wife and I are members, has a couple of good things to do to beat the summer heat. One of our favs is the Polar Bear exhibit. On a hot summer day, they're likely to be swimming, and it's a hoot to watch them from underground. They are great, hairy, graceful behemoths in the water. Kids tend to crowd the windows and bang on the glass, which their idiot parents freely allow. I don't let that bad behavior to spoil my experience but as a result, I do find myself planting myself in front of windows and other views with no guilt, even though I block it for others for a brief time- it's just a self-defense thing.   The other fav of mine is the Lorikeets, whom you can feed for $1. They are colorful and noisy, and not afraid to take what they want. They'll also poop on unsuspecting bystanders so you have to watch out. People love to give small children food cups for the birds, only to watch the more timid kids wail in fear when the birds dive in for the food.   Kids are also frequently frightened by the Himalamazon thrill ride, which is kind of a movie/roller coaster combo. I like it because it is air-conditioned excitement - we went with my brother in-law yesterday and because the kid beside him cried and his seat had to be stopped, we all 3 got another free ride. Wahoo!   In the cool bat cave, the fox bats will happily dine on fruit and broccoli, as well as try to mate. I saw one male try to move in behind a female and mate with her, but she reached up between her legs and nipped his little balls and put an end to that. I had to laugh - she plainly said, "Take that, you impudent little bugger!"  Some people say the zoo is for little kids, but my wife and I disagree. It's plainly for adults who love animals and nature and for older and braver kids.
