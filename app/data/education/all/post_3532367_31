Went into work this morning, for a couple of hours. Sharon was chatting to me on messenger and I decided I would be better off meeting her, so I claimed a headache/migrane and left on sick leave. Got the money out of the bank for my car on the way home and went over to pick Sharon up. The date started off OK, we talked while walking in a local park, then went back to her house as a storm brewed up. We finished up going upstairs and having sex in her bedroom for 2 hours.
