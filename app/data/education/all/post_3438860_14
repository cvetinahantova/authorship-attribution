What inspires us to write? Is it pain, joy, worry, freedom, love? It must be all these things of life that cause a rush of thought and a spattering of words. But, these emotions are never isolated. They always have some connection to God, humanity, to ourselves. It's the connection of life that inspires us to great thought and lovely declaration. It's relationship and all the messiness and beauty that flows from kissing lips, holding hands, cradling heads, bowing knees, praising hearts.     Two amazing, strong women in my life have inspired me to write -- if only to tell their stories. Their stories are my stories- my mother, my sister, my reflections.      The Spirit Vine --   for my loving mother, Naomi       A chronicle that needs no telling,  Enduring balance in an unwavering line.     Of mind and heart and gaze compelling,  Tender branches from the same spirit vine.     A steadfast journey of wisdom, strength, of grace bestowing,  A descent of favor and spark of eternal insight.     Vivid, shining, restoring, knowing –  An ancient beacon, a living signal light.          Veils --   for my enduring sister, Savannah       Lay your veiled regret upon me,  Bare the ache of things gone wrong,  Visit the dreams that are never to be,  Cry the wounding tears of the silent song.     Laugh into the mist of love’s pleasure,  Bask in the flowered rings of youth,  Vision the jewels of life’s treasure,  Capture the whisper of our hidden truth.
