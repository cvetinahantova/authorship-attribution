Today, well I had my teeth filled. It was hurting as hell. Of course, I hardly ever take care of them properly.  take care    News : nothing, but I´m pretty happy to go on my imaginary column. Album of the month: Vive la Fete!!! delightful  :) It´s sort of retro, but really and rock´n roll lovely!!   Time to start tomorrow : big day - I think at least.   Movies of the month : Harry Potter and Prisoner of AzKaban and Motorcycle Diaries. Both are beautiful!!!! PS: I haven´t got time for TROY ( Will they wait for me?)  href="http://www.kryptonsite.com">  is my favorite site for my favorite TV serie.   Topic of the day:    should I stay or should I go? That´s the question: if you go out you might feel like doing something at once. But then the depression comes because the immediate things take a long time to work out. For instance: gym, diet, hairdo, new books, new job and new guys. Gosh!! Life is in a hurry!!!When do the things we want will come true as soon as we decided? This would be so much better than winning the lottery...Decision: going out is funnier tha staying at home. Life is also too short...people say... bla bla bla.   Today is enough!!!!!!!
