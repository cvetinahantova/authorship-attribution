Went recce for tomolo's camp at St Andrews Junior School. Looking forward to tomolo!!! After the recce, got to attend another briefing for another raft building assignment as an instructor for Maris Stella for next week. With some time to spare in between the recce and the briefing, i went Army Market to look for my first pair of booty for water activities. Got a pair but no cash....Shitz.....ran ard the freaking area and still cannot find a UOB atm. As i was getting late for the briefing, i went for the briefing first before going back to Army Market to collect my stuff. Alas!!! The manager conducting the briefing was almost 1 hr late...... Oni got to go and collect my stuff at ard 7 plus pm. Coincidentally saw Allan Tay. As we were going opposite direction, we didnt talk much.   Reached home at ard 8 plus hungry and tired after the whole day's walking. Mum's cooking always taste so good to me. Packed my stuff for tomolo liao....actually neber really pack...just throw into my backpack.  Celin, my buddy,  will be going on her YEP trip to Thailand tomolo and after stressing herself out for this project, i wish her good luck. Too bad due to work commitment cannot send her off tomolo....hahaha.....great excuse!!   Tomolo will be a Better Day!!! MING TIAN HUI GEN HAO.... Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
