my friend Joe Scalzo just won an award...in the Associated Press Society of Ohio's 2003 newspaper competition...   First-place honors went to:  Joe Scalzo, best sports writer. About Scalzo, the judges wrote: "Writes with attitude and confidence. All of his stories and columns are a pleasure to read."   Scalzo also finished in third place as best sports columnist with the judges writing: "Funny stuff, self-deprecating at times. Written to be enjoyed. Columns have attitude and personality without being arrogant."   if you want to write to Joe --  urlLink email me  -- and i'll send you his e-mail.  those of you who are his friends aren't surprised to hear him praised as a talented writer -- i just want to know when he managed to get that arrogant tone out of his voice...
