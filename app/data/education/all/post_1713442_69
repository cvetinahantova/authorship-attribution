urlLink Peep Research - Information Literacy and Peeps  Here is a site that has fun with information literacy.  It examines a study which conducted research that shows whether a library visit increases the information literacy skills of peeps.  (You know, that really bad Easter candy kind of peep.)  It is funny because it is written so seriously. There are lots of great pictures too!  From the site, "Although scientific and health research has been conducted on Peeps, most notably that appearing on the Peep Research website (see  urlLink http://www.peepresearch.org ), we have noted an absence of research focusing on the ability of Peeps themselves to actually do research. To address this lack, we invited a small group of Peeps to visit Staley Library at Millikin University during the week of March 17-21, 2003 so that we could more closely observe their research practices. This was determined to be an ideal week for the Peeps to visit the library, as Millikin University students were on spring break. The research that follows documents their visit to the library and provides some evaluative commentary on our assessment of Peeps and library usage."
