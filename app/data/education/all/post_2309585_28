I'm having an awful day today. First of all, Andy's been in a bad mood with me since yesterday, which sucks and makes me dislike being married. I feel like such a burden. Second, I'm having to babysit Diva (my mom's dog) while they're in Florida (where I desperately wanted to go but couldn't because we thought Andy would have to work, and it turned out he didn't) and she's so depressed about not having Mom around that she's peeing all over my house. Then, when I was getting laundry together to take to Mom and Dad's house, I tripped and spilled it all over the back of the truck. Then while I was re-gathering it, I managed to sprain my elbow and it freaking  hurts . It's swelling and throbbing as we speak.   Well, we finally make it to Mom and Dad's, and we realize that we left the key to the house back at our house. So, I slammed the laundry basket down on the ground, which further hurt my elbow, and I let a few words slip that I really shouldn't have and started to cry. So we load back up, Andy drives back to the house (and, trust me, you don't want to be in the truck when he's driving mad), takes me back to Mom and Dad's, and then drives off to work. No good-bye, no kiss, nothing. Plus, I'm starving because I haven't eaten since sometime yesterday afternoon, because we still don't have a working stove.  So, I come inside and try to call Dad because he's who I like to talk to when I'm upset-- he always puts things in perspective for me. But, his cell phone won't go through. So, I throw the phone across the room and commence bawling.  Well, as for right now, I'm developing a migraine, and I'm still hungry, but I managed to get through to Zak, which made me feel a little better. Plus, I'll take a shower later, which will halp rinse some of the bad feelings off of me.  ::sigh:: It's days like this I wish I had friends I could call. I really don't have anybody. And it sucks.
