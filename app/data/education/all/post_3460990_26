My aunt Liz went to see Mom over the weekend. She called today before she left to go back to Reno, and gave me an update.  It was really good to know that the rest of the family is now becoming aware of the situation, and it's not quite so overwhelming. Aunt Liz was the executrix of my grandmother's estate, so she knows a lot more about all of the legal stuff than I do.   This has been the first weekend in a long time that I was able to get some real rest, and I think next week with summer school and university will go smoother.   Yesterday, Sarah and I went exploring down in Chinatown and got a couple little things and had lunch. Overall, it was a really nice day, and I got to relax, knowing that Aunt Liz was with Mom. (Not that I don't trust Bonnie, but Aunt Liz is a nurse, so there's an added level of confidence in that.)  Holly will be in NYC on the 22nd, and I am very excited at having her here! As another first year teacher, we will have tons to talk about! Can't wait to cram in as much fun stuff into that weekend as possible!
