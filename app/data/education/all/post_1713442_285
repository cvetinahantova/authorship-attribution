I think the idea of conceptual mapping ties in very closely tied to information literacy concepts.  It is clearly an area that librarians can offer to help teach writing students about the library and research.  From the article:  A simple exercise in conceptual mapping of students’ writing process can yield surprisingly rich results. In this active learning exercise which students find quite pleasurable, students draw steps in their writing process by employing personally expressive symbols, metaphors, and linking devices. These maps help to conceptually integrate the writing process, which is generally experienced as a fragmented activity. Sharing of conceptual maps helps forge community in the classroom as students read and learn from each other’s maps. Moreover, maps can serve as a unique form of prewriting to help students make discoveries about themselves as writers and organize that information in preparation for assignments that call for reflection on writing.
