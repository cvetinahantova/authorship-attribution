Anyone want to read the same book and talk about it on the blog?  It needn't be a "club" per se, because it doesn't matter if we all do it.  But I was thinking: I miss the  urlLink spiritual guidance ,  urlLink the softspoken wisdom , and the  urlLink incisive wit  that I enjoyed/was compelled to sit through every Tuesday afternoon for the last two years.    Some books I will selfishly suggest because I've been meaning to read them:  St. Augustine's Pigeon (Evan S. Connell) The Iliad (Homer) Mickellson's Ghost (John Gardner) Turn of the Screw (DH Lawrence) Death Comes For the Archbishop (Willa Cather) Natasha (David Bezmozgis)  Or, you know, whatever.  I say we keep it informal:  Whoever wants to makes an effort to read whatever book we agree on and then posts on it when they feel compelled to.  Let me know if you're interested; I'll be happy to do whatever work needs to be done here.
