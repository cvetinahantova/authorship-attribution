Just wanna send a quick thanks to Shawn at  urlLink Korealife blog  for hooking me up on his blog site, it has certainly brought in some traffic...Hopefully I can keep it interesting enough for you to check it out more often.  I just have to get used to this whole HTML thing.  Contrary to popular belief not all Asians are good at this kind of stuff, me being one of them.
