I can't think of a better way to initiate my blog than by posting the exchange President Bush had with an American Indian reporter at a conference for minority journalists. Go to this link:  urlLink http://www.majorityreportradio.com/weblog/archives/000581.php  and get ready to both laugh and scratch your head.  When one reflects on all the gaffes and poor decisions (wrong, misinformed, uninformed, corrupt, cast with a blind eye, etc.) this president has made, I honestly wonder how anyone can:  1) Be proud to have voted for Bush 43 2) Speak up for him today 3) Vote for him tomorrow 4) Claim him as one of yours  In my years of voting eligibility I have never supported a candidate who was the embarassment that Bush 43 has been and currently is. In 2000 I said that I couldn't vote for a candidate who was no smarter than I. In 2004 I say that I not only can't vote for him, but I will communicate information and arguments to hopefully open voter's eyes. I hate to paint whole groups of people with a broad brush, but in this world of sound-bite attention spans I advance the following: In the 1980s I came to the conclusion that the Republican Party was the party of 'I Got Mine.' George W. Bush is the poster child for that party characterization.
