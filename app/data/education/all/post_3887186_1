As I am concentrating on my introduction, I think it is important to establish my own voice in the introduction.My opening paragraphs should introduce me as a writer as well as my ideas to the reader.          One or two paragraphs are usually enough introduction for most paper in this course. I am sure, most readers do not want a great deal of background -  they want to get right to the point.          I am hoping that by stating the thesis and showing its importance, an introduction should hook readers.Or should I use a kind of strategies  that to pose a puzzling problem to connect my topic to the reader.... all these my be taken into consideration in writing an introduction for position and research paper. I am working on it.....
