You know...I am so excited about this thing. It is so neat. I just couldn't wait until tomorrow to write another one. I miss all of my friends so much. My life is taking such a turn and all I can think of is you guys. How did you guys do this and not just be scared out of your mind? I am so nervous. I am afraid that I am going to get to Ft. Worth and not like it and want to come home. I am too anxious about all of this stuff. I just wanted to let a little of it out. Everyone here is really sad that I am leaving and it is kind of hard to let them know that I am scared to death of being completely on my own. But, on the upside of things...I am going to be making 40+ G's baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rock and roll!!!!! I am going to party like its 1999. Just kidding. I am so past that phase of my life. My kind of partying these days is two beers and going to bed. LOL!!! I am getting old. Bad knees, sore back, aching joints, etc. Wow, I am really in a random state of mind. Anyway, just venting about all of this stuff. On top of all of this, I am going to be a quarter of a century old. I know I have said this before, but I am going through a quarter life crisis!!! Damn!!!! I can't believe what I have been through in the past two years. I am finally close to where I want to be and I am scared to grab it and run. What is wrong with me?!?!?!?! Don't worry. I will be ok. Are you calling me fat?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?! I really needto go to bed.
