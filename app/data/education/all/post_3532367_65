Yesterday morning is where I am going to begin in any detail. I had driven my bike over to the local dealer to get its service done. While waiting, I thought I would ring the GP for an appointment in the hope of getting some information on counseling. I wanted some help to prevent me getting spending impulses and finding anything suitable was proving very difficult. The appointment was set for 10:45 and I eventually got there at 10:55, having waited nearly an hour longer than I was told for my bike.  The GP was great, when I explained to her what I wanted, she said she would need some more background information and proceeded to ask lots of leading questions. The whole thing took over 30 minutes - the longest I've ever been in a doctors surgery (waiting excluded). The outcome was that she thought that I used spending, eating and sexual activity to get my "happy kicks" when feeling low, and if I couldn't get these I would turn to internal frustration and moods instead of external displays of anger and violence. The good news was that I hadn't developed into using alcohol and drugs!  She would refer me to the in-house counselor, who may in turn refer me to someone more specialist - RESULT!  BUT, in the meantime she wanted me to go onto Anti-depressants....Prozac!  "But I'm not depressed" was my immediate reaction and "Anti-depressants have a stigma!"  She calmed me down and said it was either a stigma or getting help. The drugs would help my body with the need for a chemical high, while the counseling would help to re-train my thoughts and approach. The two would work together to reduce my need to spend, eat and have sex.
