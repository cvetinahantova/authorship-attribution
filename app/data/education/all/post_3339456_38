Loathe as I am to support Philippine president and US lapdog Gloria Arroyo in any way, I will give her kudos for  urlLink agreeing to withdraw  troops from Iraq in response to the kidnapping and threatened beheading of a Filipino working in Iraq.  Some will say in response that we must never negotiate with terrorists.  My response is that the troops shouldn't be there in the first place, not under US auspices anyway.  I am not defending those who behead, and threaten to behead.  They are guilty of grave crimes against humanity, and should be dealt with through the International Criminal Court.  However, it should be no surprise that terrorism has increased in Iraq since the war and occupation began.  We know they are there, what they want to accomplish, and what they are willing to do to accomplish.  Countries that send people top Iraq under US auspices are complicit in any injuries or deaths that result.  Speaking of  urlLink blackmail , what would you call the US, with their other lapdogs Japan and Australia in tow, suggesting that the withdrawal of Filipinos will affect US Phillipine relations?  So kudos to Arroyo.  Then again, there's  urlLink this .
