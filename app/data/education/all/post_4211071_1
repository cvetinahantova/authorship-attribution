Wahlau... I had been dreaming of having a black "baju kurung" and this year my mom bought me this silky kain with red roses flowers... It is beautiful... Especially after it had finally made into proper dress... I have all the flowers at the front side of my dress embroided with beads... Thanks   mom  !  Really love you       I'll post the pictures of my new shoes and handbag soon....      urlLink     Beaded roses...
