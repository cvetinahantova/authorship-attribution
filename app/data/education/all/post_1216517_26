IS THERE A LIBRARY ON EASTER ISLAND?  I got a library card today.  I'm pretty excited.  I can read now.  In case you're in  urlLink New York ...  oh, here's some  urlLink pictures  of where I live.  The middle ones, not the cool ones.  I saw a special on the Discovery Channel about  urlLink Easter Island  the other day.  It was really interesting.  For those of you they don't know, Easter Island is the most remote populated island in the world.  It has hundreds of these giant statues everywhere.  It's pretty spooky.  Supposedly they're idols that watch over the island.  They're pretty impressive.  Some say Aliens made them, kinda like the Pyramid theory.  Anyways, they're really cool looking and interesting.  If you know what's good for you, you'll check out the website.  It's incredibly informative.  I don't know if the have libraries there though.
