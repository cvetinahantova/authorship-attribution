Well things are coming along.  I'm feeling mostly better- less coughing, less stuffyness less soar throat.  Costuming- supplies bought- shirt maid- the hands for the mire witch have made there way to conneticut and still say they'll be delivered tomorrow.  Felt project 11 glued, rest are cut- phil is finishing up with the cutting and gluing for the remaining 13.  Laundry got done too.  Don't know whats up with my girls(cats loki and ari) they seem attention starved- sleeping on my at night and meowing at me to pet them and play with them.  Today's plans- finish work got some work work to do and some reading to keep my busy- quite day here.  Walk on my lunch?!?!?  Unless I come up with something more pressing that needs my attention.  Maybe hit the gym on the way home- whether I walk or not been missing workouts due to sickness.  Weighed into day 2 down since starting tracking- not bad considering I'm at my heaviest time of the month.  I'll be real active with Nero this weekend so I'll weigh in again next week for more accuracy.  Better eat- well more contorolled portions (i've been over eating alot lately) and getting to the gym more often are important.  Next week out of the office m-w at a conference in boston.  Which means I need to leave out long weekend event early and come home and sleep so I can get there on monday.  Back to further plans- gym on the way home?!?!  Girls night.  Damn forgot to mention it to Jackie or leave a note.  Ah well I'll have Deb head over and we'll wait a bit for Jackie- think she's coming home since she mentioned it in the first place.  Day off tomorrow yah summer schedule.  Must get sticker for my car.  Pick up witch hands and other stuff piling up at my parents.  Sleep in.  Shop at costco, get to site in the afternoon.  Hummm maybe i should get a sticker at lunch and walk a few time through the day.
