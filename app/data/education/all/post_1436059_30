Romeo and Juliet's: Juliet - The daughter of Capulet and Lady Capulet. A beautiful thirteen-year-old girl, Juliet begins the play as a naÃƒÂ¯ve child who has thought little about love and marriage. She grows up quickly, though upon falling in love with Romeo, the son of her family's great enemy. Though she loves Romeo as profoundly as he loves her, Juliet nevertheless demonstrates a more level and sober head than does her paramour. Until a falling out near the end of the play, the Nurse is Juliet's closest, and, it seems, only confidante and friend. She fakes her death upon being ordered into an unwanted marrige and Romeo, thinking Juliet dead, kills himself in her tomb. Upon awakening and seeing Romeo dead, Juliet stabs herself with Romeo's dagger.    urlLink   * Which Tragic Shakespearean Heroin are You? *     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Ehh, good enough for me, I gues...
