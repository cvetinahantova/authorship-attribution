OK! so i went back to work today for the first time in 3 weeks.. the early thing sucks. i didn't know the sun came up befor noon... anyway. the girls were excited to see me, their dad was acting weird but maybe he's just weird and i didn't pick up on it until today. we went to purple glaze and then had a picnic at Florence Park (which is on Gary and 21st not Florence and 21st.. crazy ppl messin' with my head..). really we just fed the squirrels.. foamy made me do it. we went back to the house and played and then i was ignored for a good hour. apparently that was supposed to be my punishment for making them turn the tv off.. oh well. then i got to park on highway 75 for 20 mins while god knows what was going on around the 41st st and union exit. an accident i'm assuming but i never did hear anything on the radio for it.    alright so enough about that mindless stuff.. i colored my hair tonight. and guess what! i don't look like an osu mascot! hopefully it'll keep the red tint and not turn orange.. haha. anyway. it still looks very brown to me but everyone else in my house says it looks different.. you'll have to judge for yourself i suppose.
