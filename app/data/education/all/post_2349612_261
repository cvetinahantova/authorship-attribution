i need to develop the ability to sleep for more than 2-3 hours at a time again, because i can't anymore...  two nights ago i went to sleep at 3:30am and woke up with a jolt at 6:16am convinced that i had slept 15 hours or something ridiculous... looked closer at the clock and realized, no, i really should still be in bed  last night, similar... went to sleep at 4:30am and woke up suddenly at 6:40... was convinced i had slept for 14 hours and started to get up and do stuff, only to realize i'd only been in bed for 2 hours.  even after going back to sleep, both nights i woke up again around 10 and made myself go back to sleep again before getting up noon-ish.  this wouldn't be quite as strange if like i normally got up at 6/7am, but i never do intentionally...  this also wouldn't be quite as bad if i thought i was completely stressed out; but here, i am summer time, with a schedule of "wake up when i want, study some, have some fun with my friends, go to sleep when i'm tired"... it bothers me that i'm yawning all the time and not able to sleep for more than 2-3 hours... maybe i need drugs. =P
