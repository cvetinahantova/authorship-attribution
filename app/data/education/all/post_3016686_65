Last night was the  Finn Brothers  show and it was, not surprisingly, brilliant. They did "Six Months In A Leaky Boat," a rousing "There Goes God" and - thank God - "Four Seasons In One Day." One of the new songs, "Gentle Hum," gave me chills because they stopped the music and the audience hummed. It was a new song, but people seemed to get it.   Lisa and I were discussing Neil Finn's voice recently. It's always so amazingly strong live - it doesn't wear out, even though it seems like the kind of voice that would. I think he  does  get credit as one of the best modern songwriters, but people never mention what a great vocalist he is.    Tim Finn was a crazy-man dancer and told a funny story about how he met a woman at the YMCA here (just around the corner from my work!) and promised he'd put her on the list, but uncharacteristically forgot to do it.  "Is Valentina here? Did you have to pay? Valentina?!" It was a good segue moment because Neil quipped, "I am sure she will suffer never" and then they played "Suffer Never," which turned into a Sonic Youth Moment.  They had a breakdown bit with all this weird feedback - they were all kneeling in front of their monitors fiddling to get the noise!   Here is (most of?) the set list, in no order, from  urlLink Frenz.com  .
