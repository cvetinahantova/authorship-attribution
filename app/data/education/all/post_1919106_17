I've been thinking...   No, seriously, I *have* been thinking. I know that I complain a lot about how horribly stupid that English Literature class is, but I like to look at both sides of an issue. And it is there that I remembered one of my favorite books, "The Science of Discworld", by Terry Pratchett, Ian Stewart, and Jack Cohen. One of the early arguments that the books makes is that we live in a society of lies. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly causes confusion from time to time. The authors call that practice "lies to children". If you look at how we teach things then you'd notice that we start out with outright lies: for example, in mechanical physics we first teach Newton's laws, even though we know that they're only a rough approximation. But they are easy to teach, easy to learn, and once you understand them then you can more easily understand quantum mechanics. In other words, Newton's laws are lies to children.  So maybe this English Literature class is just another lie to children, and I'm just pissed off because I know that it's a lie. Mind, knowing this won't prevent me from bitching about the class for the rest of the semester - I still think that it's a complete waste of time for me.
