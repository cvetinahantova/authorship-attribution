urlLink Michael Moore  celebrated Independence Day by launching a  urlLink blog .  It's amazing that it took him so long since blogging seems like a natural fit for him.

Can't Jon Stewart do a Sunday show?    It will be interesting to see if he can keep it up.  He's tried an online diary before, and subscribers to his email list can confirm that he regularly promises to write more often, but does not.  The nerve!  It's almost as if he thinks that writing best selling books and Academy and Cannes award winning movies is more important than communicating with his fans.
