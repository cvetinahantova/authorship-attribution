After a long week of feeling like I've been neglecting you all, I am now home with no concerns of leaving you in the lurch for a little while.  This last weekend S, Shorty and I took my cousin, CS, back home to Houston.  We would have just let my Aunt and Uncle come get her, but it was necessary for us to take her so that we could visit with my Uncle B who just returned from his tour in Turkey.  He has been in the Air Force for about 18 years now, and just spent the last 5 years in Turkey as some kind of body guard/personal assistant to one of the higher up generals.  Now he gets to return to the US and eventually retire from the AF.  It was great to see B.  He's not much older than I am and is like the missing child in our family.  Everyone is happier when he comes to visit.  Now that he will be in the states again (N. CA), we are happy to know that we will be able to go visit him occasionally also.  I will have to post more later, I need to take Shorty to day care. He starts his new classroom today which is twice the size of his last classroom.  I can't tell if he is excited or not yet.  Time will tell.  More to be posted later today.
