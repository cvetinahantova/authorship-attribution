HI!  Hi guys and girls! It's Morgan, you know, the one that you nearly are all forgeting about! Yeah! That's me!   So what happen on my first day of school. I was a loner...did crap all. Tuesday; work but LONER! Wednesday just gets better; did work, danced (both tap and jazz. F*(k tap is so hard here! Jazz a bit easier then tap) BUT STILL LONER...  You getting the picture? Let me sum it up...school, loner. there. Well I'm sure as hell you guys would of had a better week (dude I rock my Chemistry class!) Totally missing the people stated below:  Tonya, Rose, Lily, Hayden, Tonya, Brad C, Brad H, Tonya, Candy, Mike (so what), Tonya, David (not really), Paul (STOP SENDING ME SMS's WITH NO QUESTIONS LIKE "Hi, how was your day. I wish you'd come back and beat the crap out of David...etc), Tonya, Rose, Zoe (sort of...more than David but less than Mike), Tonya, Cody (YEAH RIGHT!),Bec B, Bec O, Shandi, Tonya, Tonya  (can you guess who I'm missing the most?)  If I missed you out, sorry!  Update on LOTR WE GOT 11 OSCAR NOMINATIONS PEOPLE! YAY!  Update on Bloom HE MIGHT BE PROPOSING TO KATE BOS...SOMTHING  That ends my message but I will end with a funny quote I found on the internet about none of the cast getting nomintions for the Oscars.    "A day may come, when the Academy will find its arse with a touch...but it is not this day"   hehe! BYE! :)
