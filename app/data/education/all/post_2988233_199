As you all know, she is in Chapel Hill right now, supposed to be doing her workup for the transplant.    She is sick.  Eveidently, she caught a bug before she left, and started running a temp yesterday after they got down there.  They wound up in the ER last night getting her ammonia checked, it was 176, normal is somewhere around 20.  She woke up vomiting this morning, so Renee isn't sure if the docs will still start the work up or not.  Please pray for her either way.  She has to be sedated for two fo the tests, and sedation is hard on her little body.  There are many side effects and potential problem with her disease coming from being sedated, so she really needs to be as healthy as possible.    I will keep updating when I hear from Renee.  I know the Grandmother's are ready to go down asap, if needed.  I have EJ, but will go down if I am needed more there.    Pray for Renee and Stan, this is so stressful for them.  They are by themselves down there, and don't have any support buy each other, and when you are both as stressed as they are, you aren't much support for others.    till later...
