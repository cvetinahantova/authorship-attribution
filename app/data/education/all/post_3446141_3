YAY, the rerun of the Nip/Tuck premier comes on tonight at 10 and I will be watching it!!  So don't call me........ok so no one really reads this....lol, so they won't know, phone will be on vibrate. AND YAY for having Alicia's Birthday as the best excuse not to attend the morning 1/2 of my family reunion on Sunday.  I will be happy for a little sleep.  Ok that is all!  Everyone have a very lovely weekend........No training next week either!!
