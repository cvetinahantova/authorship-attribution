you see, reading my old diary gave me this sence of belonging, knowing where i am, not feeling lost, floating b/w dreams and paranoia. i felt like i had a mirror and was looking back at who i was and understanding almost and connecting with that person i used to know so well.i felt home for once, in a house i barely knew. i felt sane. i felt like this is who i was     xo~kd
