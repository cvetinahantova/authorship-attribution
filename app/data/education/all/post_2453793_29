i went to pick up one of my roommates downtown the other night and we ended up eating at old chicago.  i really like their salads...that whole almond thing is yummy.  anyway, even though i had 80 4-page tests to grade, we stayed there until a little past 11 playing pool and talking.  it was really fun.  we agreed that we really should hang out alone more often.  he told me this really elaborate story about his childhood...which was very interesting.  we also talked quite a bit about this girl he met online that he really likes.  i'm really happy for him...the only thing is that i'm starting to get extremely worried.  i'm jealous of this girl and i feel really selfish.  i'm worried that she's going to take him away from me.  already he's changed, and he hasn't even met her.  i'm not the best at putting my feelings into words.  i really wish i was a poet.  or that i could write song lyrics.  that would be even better.  music is so amazing.  unfortunately, i can't do either and the best way i can describe my life is that right now it feels sort of stagnate and lonely.  the worst part is that i'm struggling because i have no idea how to change it.
