Theme for today : Heroes.  What are heroes? Huang Fei Hong? Superman?? Ninja Turtles?? Have i ever seen a hero? Have i ever felt a hero? Yes, i did.  Who are they? What are they? Where are they?   Saw the show on SARS on CH 8 moments ago. Who are the heroes? The nurses? Yes. The doctors?? Yes. The logistic support staff? Yes. These are the real heroes because they layed down their lives in order to save the patients infected with SARS. They stood their grounds when the world around them is going awry. I cant imagine the amount of fear , despair and stress they suffered during that period yet retreat was not a decision they took. Without them, none of Singaporeans will ever be saved from SARS. These are the people who deserved the real respect!   Mr Heng Yeow Peow, a true to life hero. He could have survived the nicoll highway collapse if he did not choose to go back into the site to save his fellow colleagues. Can we do that in times of danger. The decision is diificult in a Fight or Flight situation.   Mdm Bee Ngoh, a Singaporean lady i've known in Cambodia. She was willing to spend her last 10 yrs in Cambodia helping the locals. Life wasn't as good and comfortable and definitely not safe as compared to singapore , yet she was willing to do it in the name of humanity. On top of Mdm Bee Ngoh, the many humanitarian workers around the world that seeks to help the less fortunate should also be honoured.   I couldn't describe my utmost respect for these heroes. I could just silently pray for them.  I wished i could do what i am supposed to do , not for the sake of being a hero but at least not being a villian. I wish i could emulate their behaviour. I wished  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
