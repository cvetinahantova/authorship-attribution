Three things I wish my son didn't know:  1. Green means go and red means stop--This would prevent a lot of yelling while driving together.  Whenever he sees a stop light he scream either "Green, Mommy!  Go faster, go faster!" or "Red light!  Stop, Mommy!" (which is better than when he just yells "Stop!", making me think he knows something I don't).  2.  That Dairy Queen and Baskin Robbin sell ice cream--For obvious reasons.  3.  Please and a sweet smile will get you almost anything--Especially from Daddy.  Oh, who am I kidding?  From mommy, too.
