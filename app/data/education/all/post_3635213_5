So... you know how I was cut... WELL... I just found out that Johnson Elementary hired TWO NEW SECOND GRADE TEACHERS!!!! So... I am not too happy with them. This basically means they could have hired me back and left me in the same place that I was last year. This is okay though because I think Coppell will be a new and better experience. I just want to STAY somewhere for more then a year and really get to know the staff, children, parents, and my team without having to just leave them ALL at the end of the year.     sigh... crazy Southlake Carroll ISD...
