Hmmm I think I fail to remember that a state of well being is very important and that includes healthy disposition, physically and the like. Paano ba naman I was interrupted by a very disgusting cough while I was still sleeping at six o'clock in the morning. Sobrang sakit ng lalamunan at likod ko..I think I needed to see a physician to diagnose and give me proper medication or I do it by myself with proper care and drinking of right herbal medicines..well I will think. I miss Jorge, I wish I am with him hugging and cuddling, but I have class and responsibility to do in the school..so I am here rainy or sunny season. Today I met Ms. Eufenia Rabanal(studies Ma in Pastoral ministry in LST), 80-year old lady,very interesting...she always study and at that age she still have that zeal and enthusiasm in her to learn more (academically). She taught us a little of international phonetics which she practically study for 5-years in Rome. I love her disposition! She's cool old lady, who defies the real sense of age in the way she experience, look and live life! This is the wonder of life.  I wish i'll spend my life beatifully like her...I wish to be with my love.
