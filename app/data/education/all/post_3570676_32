This the first time I ever heard of blogging. With dial-up access you tend not to spend a lot of time conversing over the internet. I still prefer a telephone or face-to-face conversation - you can't read body language or voice inflection in a blog!  It can serve a purpose but too often we get caught up in the technology bells and whistles and we lose sight of the human social interactions that are being replaced by technology connections.
