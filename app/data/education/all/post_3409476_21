The boys got to play today and play they did.  They beat the S. Korea team 18 to 0.  ANd also beat the Newar NJ team (I don't know the score.)  So they are at this time the #1 seed.  According to Adam they are guaranteed the Bronze, if they win one game tomorrow they will get Silver and if they win both games tomorrow they get Gold.  So all in all a very good time is being had.  The Rock N ROll Hall of Fame was a bust even the old guy (coach Steve my age) said it wasnt worth the time or admission price of $20.
