[Follow the links to understand]  After Hillel’s Volunteer Shabbat, a bunch of us old school kids go out for drinks at the District Lounge on 45th, underneath the Meany Tower. I’m chatting with Josh Epstein, when Tal leans over and says she has a story. She begins, “So, their was this online game of Texas Hold’em, this poker game, with like, 3,000 people playing. The winner gets a Porsche. And the winner, is sitting right next to me.”   At the first mention of an online poker game with a Porsche as the grand prize, I think of this set of  urlLink comments  regarding a post on  urlLink jewschool  a few weeks. And when Tal says the winner is sitting right next to her, my mouth did this bastardization of hitting the floor and cracking a smile. Because clearly, I’ve just met Ariela’s brother who won the Porsche.   So I ask him “Does your sister have a Blog?” He’s eyes go wide and his mouth did the same jaw dropping/stupid grin mine must have done, because he say, something akin to, “Yeah, she loves it. Does it all the time”. And so, I tell him, that I’ve read his sister’s  urlLink blog  and knew this story as it was being told to me.   As if the Jewish world wasn’t small enough, the Jewish  urlLink blogosphere  makes it even smaller. And now that I look at the  urlLink picture  again (hit CTRL+f, search ‘Porsche’), what I thought was Miami, suddenly looks like the Eastside of Lake Washington. In my defense, the first time I saw the picture, I wasn’t looking for detail, and figured, what is clearly and evergreen branch, was a palm frond.
