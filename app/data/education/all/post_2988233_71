I have been reading  urlLink life at TJ's Place   for a week or so now.  The guy Kevin is a manager at a Gentleman's Club aka strip bar.  He really has a way with words, and makes the mundane seem so extraordinary.  But then I doubt that life at a strip club could be to mundane.  Shame he's a fightin Illini fan.  Oh well, the world would be a dull place to be if we all loved Duke!
