Opening my heart, lightening my load, lengthening my spine, pulling energy from the cosmos, pinpoint focus, concentration developing intensity, commitment never to falter, daily rehersal, prayer, devotion, chanting, walking, singing, dancing, swimming, biking, skating, drawing, anything that takes me out of my ego, deriving moments outside of the pain, or rather deep inside the real self that is inseperable from the divine.    Walking this morning with joy in the knowledge, walking from the center of my being, offering up prayers and thanks, aligning my body, stretching, feeling, atuning to the ray of hope that has been offered, to the promise of peace and deep purpose.
