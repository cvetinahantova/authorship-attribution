The Dictator and I were both asleep last night by 8:30.  It was heaven...at least on my part.  Of course, we both overslept today and thus I was late to work this morning, but whatev.  Things to do today:   Call StepMonster and check out the plans for this weekend.  Go to UMC and find out if I have tomorrow off for Sarah's wedding.  Finish painting the damn house.  Mow the yard.  Take out the trash.  (Ew, the smelly, smelly, smelly trash.)   If I can accomplish most of these things than I'll feel as though my day is good.  The wedding date is moving.  Perhaps to March.  Monkeypants's best friend Army Dave is unable to make it in April because he moves to Hawaii in late March and can't get here or something.  So stay tuned, faithful readers, as I may be a married woman even sooner than I thought I would be.
