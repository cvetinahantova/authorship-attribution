Did you ever wonder if things in your life could pile up so high that you can't take care of them? I've been wondering that lately. It just seems like there is not enough time in the day to take care of everything that needs taken care of.        The grass needs cut (it's a jungle out there), the bills need payed (ugh), the house needs cleaned (yuck!), need to call the bank (no money there anyway), need to sleep (that's an important one), the dog needs walked (I could use the exercise myself), and the list goes on.     However, God promises to take care of His children....and I'm one of those rowdy little kids, right? Right.    Oh well, I guess it will all get done eventually. Signing off.   Current mood: Depressed   Current music: Jars of Clay
