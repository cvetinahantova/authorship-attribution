Overheard Yesterday...  At the end of each wing of my school, there is a staff bathroom.  The term "staff bathroom" makes it sound much more glamourous than it is.  It's actually a glorified broom closet with a toilet.  But that's not the impression the kids have...  Girl 1:  What is that? Girl 2:  It's the "staff bathroom". Girl 1:   Really?  Girl 2:  Yeah, it's way cool in there.  I was inside said bathroom when I heard this.  I glanced around and almost laughed outloud.  Honestly folks, there is a toilet, a sink, a ladder, and a step stool in there (schools are always short of storage space, so we make do--at one point we seriously discussed storing books in the staff bathrooms).  Nothing on the walls.  Grey, industrial tiles.    It's so easy to impress young minds.
