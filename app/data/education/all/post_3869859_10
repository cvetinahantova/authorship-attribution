The miniature rosebush on my desk is dying. At first I consciously checked its water level every day, maybe several times a day.I made sure it was happy, in the sun, and it bloomed.     It has weathered a lot in the past 7 months-- I thought it had died for good when I was in Japan in February since no one took care of it. When I came back and gave it some attention, it revived and even rebloomed. Since then, it's been sitting in the sun, receiving occasional water.     During the past few weeks, though, it's been suffering from inattention. Now half of the leaves are brown; stalks are drying out. I could pluck the dead leaves, but they serve as a reminder of its former glory. The dead leaves fall and litter my cluttered desk. No matter how many I clean up, more still seem to fall.     I don't need this rosebush. There are roses blooming on the giant rosebushes outside, and I can smell their sweet fragrance drifting in through the window.     Maybe I should put the little one outside to learn from the big ones, then bring it back inside in a few weeks? Maybe then I will learn how to be less dependent on it.    I probably don't want to abandon it forever, though.
