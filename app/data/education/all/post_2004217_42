Wow. What a gig. As ever, Hell Is For Heroes came out onto that stage to deafening screams and played. Just played. Upfront, ballsy, fuck off rock songs that, in my humble, obsessed opinion, will live on forever. And they weren't even at their best; it's a perfect measure of their talent when a gig that could have been better was still fantastic. They began with I Can Climb Mountains- in my opinion it probably would have been more effective leaving it until last, but who gives a shit about the set list- all the songs were just... wow. Even the new stuff sounds fantastic- I feel like I know it already. There's this one song, Folded Paper Figures, and it's brutal- I wanna listen to it over and over again, it's just 4 minutes of anger and spite combined with sheer musical talent. Mindblowing. The support weren't bad either- first band Copperpot Journals were very good, very talented, but didn't quite grab me. Second band was The Lucky Nine- as soon as I heard the name I knew I recognised it from somewhere but I couldn't put my finger on it... then Colin bloody Doran from Hundred Reasons and Dan Carter from 'A' walked onstage. My jaw dropped. It's this new Britrock "supergroup" that Kerrang! have been going on about for a few weeks- in a word, metal. Not my scene, but still talented.  And so now, the countdown begins... 3 days... until it's time...  Ceff x   I can build bridges from ones you burn...
