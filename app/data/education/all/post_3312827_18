Work was terrible today.  Since it was so nice, I think most people had BBQs for their fathers.  So I only made like $20.  :(  But the owner is putting me on Wednesdays and Thursdays during the day and Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at night, so I should be making some good money.  They must have some faith in my waitressing abilities if they're putting me on their busiest nights!  Tomorrow is D-Day!!!  Anyway want to go out???
