Its such a great place.  Went out Christmas shopping today and got everyithing I wanted within 20 mins walk from home.  With its deli's, bookbinder, record shops and second hand book shops as well as all the little cool shops it has everything.  This is a great place to live!  The (new) Greedy Greek Deli sells lunch boxes of stuffed Chillis, Fig Leaves, Meat Balls and Samosa type things for ï¿½2 each.  Yummy indeed.
