That game was so fucking awesome. I almost wish I hadn't beat it, just so I could still be stuck deep down in the plot, ignorant to everything around me. That game changed the way I think, it was so cool. Also, I've decided that the people at Ubisoft are my gods. I'm going to build an altar and worship them. Fuck, I wanna work there... Splinter Cell, XIII, and now Prince of Persia. Ubisoft is on top of things.  You know, it was really revolutionary. Not only did it make you think from start to finish through the puzzles (mindless puzzles have been all the rage lately), which were the core element of the game, but the plot was a rollercoaster of heart twinges, satisfied sighs, and tears of joy. Some people play games for the action, some people for the challenge, some for the story. I play for the story. Any game that doesn't have good character development and a wicked plot is meaningless to me. Like Spyhunter... that was interesting, because they attempted to have a plot built into a racing game--big mistake. That game was horrible.  More babbling, because I'm still awestruck XIII -- a beautifully rendered identity crisis with plot twists so awesome it makes your head spin. Totally my kind of game. Splinter Cell -- Stealth action redefined. I love being sneaky, and Splinter Cell was the first stealth game to really  take the initiative to offer oodles of movement options (split jumps, zip lines, etc.) and still keep a clean interface. Prince of Persia -- The ultimate puzzle game/the ultimate time travel game (in a way)/the ultimate story-driven game. Even if it didn't have any replay value (which it does) I would have to buy it anyway, just because it would be blasphemy not to.  You know what, this is crap, and I'm tired, so I'll just post tomorrow when I'm awake, and my heart has returned to a normal rhythm.
