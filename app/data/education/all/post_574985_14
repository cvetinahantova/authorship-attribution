Behold, the old website has passed away. Behold, all things e-vangelism.com have become new.  After months of posing as a faux weblog, the e-vangelism.com website has finally joined the ranks of real blogs. Now powered through the wonders of  urlLink blogger , this site will feature all the latest news and links pertaining to the subject of online evangelism. This new approach to personal publishing also will replace the  urlLink Good News Bulletin  newsletter that I published from 1999-2003.  I'm looking forward to getting back into the swing of things again with this relaunch. Thanks to all the faithful GNB readers for their patience over the past several months.  I'll continue to tweak the interface and plan to add syndication for this blog in the coming weeks.  Grace and peace, Andrew C.
