A Part Of Me  It wasn't easy, it won't be simple. To forget you will be a big challenge, as a part of me is still with you.  I can't and I won't take it back, just hope that you'll always remember me. Happy memories have been remembered,  sad memories have been locked in the back of my mind. But i'm just glad i once had you.  The many first we have shared, the many joy i won't forget. When you kissed me on the lips, i simply melted deep inside. When ever i see you, i fall for you even deeper. The butterflies in me won't be gone. What ever you say, what ever you do, i'll always remember every  details of you. If only i can turn back time, I will definitely cherish you more. But the past is past, I got to look forward and continue with life just as i have promised you back then. My dear, I love you.
