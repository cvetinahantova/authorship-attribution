So I don't really have anything to talk about today.   Life is strange like that.  Everything, and then nothing.   My boobs are still huge.  But I'm not pregnant, so I guess its cool.  Weird, but cool.  *BAM!*  Overnight boobs.   I weeded in my front yard yesterday.  Now I just need to mow.  (Hear that Monkeypants? Extension cord extension cord extension cord.)   Still looking for  a new job.  I just know one is going to fall into my lap.   House sitting for Mum this weekend.  Should be fun.
