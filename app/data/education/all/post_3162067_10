Another crap day. Seriously tempted to not bother going in tomorrow, although I probably will. Keep hoping I'll catch the flu or something so I can stay at home but, regardless, it'll still look poor on my job references, and I'm having a difficult enough time as it is. Sigh. Today's hot discussion in my Year Nine class was whether I had a large vagina or not. Can you believe it? It's an absolute disgrace. I'm so knackered that I can't even be good-humoured about it; it really upset me that they talked about me in such a crass and unkind way. Too tired and defeated to protest or do anything much. Going back to the doctors tomorrow.
