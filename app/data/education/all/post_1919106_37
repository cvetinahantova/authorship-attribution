Dammit...   I forgot to mention... last Friday was the first CSClub meeting, and Simon quite ruined it... he  forgot to order pizza , and he has absolutely no willpower to manage the crowd. Sure, I didn't plan the meetings myself when I was president, and Simon is only VP, but at least there was stuff going on when I was there. And we  ALWAYS  had pizza.
