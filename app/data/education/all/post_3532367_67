Sorry, my language is always the first thing to go when I am stressed. I've had a couple of texts from Angela, but we've not been able to chat because she has gone out for the day with her friend. I feel like I have lost a limb. She says we need to chat ASAP and I agree with her. I just hope so muchÂ that it all works out.  I went for a walk at lunch to try and stay awake as I was falling asleep at my desk. When I got back I had a call from my director to go and see the department that were messing me about last week. They had started again, complaining about a problem which it transpires was fixed by an external engineer last week. I asked why they had not said anything about it and was told by the staff they their boss had told them not to tell us. The frustration has compounded and its now taking itself out on my head again.   It hurts. I am so low, so down and things are getting to me so easily. I'm not sure how much longer I can cope.
