Today, we went to Indianapolis to visit a lady who recently moved there from our church and town. It was nice, actually better than I had expected. I never realized that elderly people like candy as well as we do. Really, they like candy and ice cream. It's cool.       Tomorrow, I'm planning on going to see Princess Diaries 2... awesomeness! Then, we'll go shopping and go out to eat. So much fun!       In about 25 minutes or so, we'll be heading for church. It's probably going to be boring. Darren, my youth minister, won't be there because he's at church camp. Great. This will be nice. NOT!      Oh well, like it or not, it's gonna happen. I'll talk more later!       Silent
