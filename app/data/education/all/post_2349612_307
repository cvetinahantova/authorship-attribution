had a plant question for my dad earlier, but he's visiting g-ma pudwell for her 79th birthday this weekend... so i figured i'd call and say hi to everyone (parents and the grandmother) all at once... however, it ended up being the weirdest discussion i've ever had with my grandma... ever me: hi grandma! how are you? g-ma: oh hi, how are you? what's wrong? me: nothing, i was just calling to say hi and see how you're doing g-ma: oh, well, lar, then i have terrible news me: what's that? g-ma: luella died on friday... i don't know what i'm gonna do.  luella is g-ma's best friend in her apartment complex... when i was on my roadtrip, i went over to visit with her for an hour and show her pictures as well... when g-ma and g-pa moved to g-ma's current place (when i was in 9th grade), luella and orville were the other couple close in age to my grandparents who had similar ideas of how to spend their time, so they had a lot of fun as a group of 4... then g-pa died so dynamics changed by lu was still g-ma's best friend... now with lu gone, orville's at a complete loss and i'm not sure how long he'll last without her... g-ma's at a loss in her own way too, although she seems to go strong through everything... at least she still has bob (her boyfriend) around...  at any rate... a little bummed about luella... not that i knew her exceedingly well, but i visited with her a bit every time i was around g-mas for the last 9 years and i'm sad for g-ma and for orville that she's gone now...  on the flip side of the coin....  happy quotes of the day ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  pastor j: (in the kids' sermon, holding up an egg): so if i broke this open, i'd have two things... a yoke and....? kid: and a mess!!!  so yeah i dropped my computer the other day and saw some sparks and some smoke come out of it, and so i called gateway and asked them if that was normal and they were like 'no, not at all, what have you done to it?'" ~eric  no, so here's what you do instead... you call up scott and say 'hey, scott, i need to make a phone call and i don't want to', eric says get me some tequila. ~eric  yeah, that transition didn't work so well, but they're still quality quotes, right? =P  time for "lunch"... later dudes
