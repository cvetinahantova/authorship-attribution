Ever have one of those too absolutely exhausted to do much of anything, but wanting to do something... until the something turns out to be laying a new dreain field?    Boy has it been one of those weeks.... Jacqueline was hurt when she fell into a window. I can't tell you how that scared me. She has been such a stoic about it though. I usually believe in supporting my children's feelings and emotional expressions but I think I would have lost it if she had. Just remembering how the wounds first looked makes me nauseous. I was so scared that it was so much worse than it turned out to be. I could just see the muscle being cut. But, she was soooo lucky that the person who framed the window did such a good job.   I'll have to finish this later... and yes there is a drainfield involved, but I 'promise I won't get descriptive about that.   Bye
