I enjoyed this article.  I guess because under each rule of good technology, it provided a real-world example.  Like rule number 3 - Good technology is always connected, it talks about fire alarms....they are always connected!  It also provided examples of things that have become so popular because of their advances...like the telephone.  It is simple to use, does not require any "start up", and is readily available for a cheap price.  It does what we want it to do and we don't have to wait to use it after someone else (well, sometimes we do).  I think good technology is also adaptable.  I have added to and used different products with my computer at home.  I have added a scanner, webcam, digital camera, CD burner, and tons of software.  My computer has adapted with me as my needs have changed.  That's what makes it good technology.  It also has done everything I have asked it to do.  It falls under several of the good rules of technology.  These 9 rules are a good guide to purchasing and improving technology at home or at school.  They can be a valuable resource when starting the process of purchasing new technology.  BC
