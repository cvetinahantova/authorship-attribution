I officially made the jump to maternity clothes. I couldn't breathe anymore. This is much more comfortable. It is strange because now I actually look pregnant and not like I just ate WAY too much. I weighed myself today. I am trying not to balloon too big. The doctor told me to gain between 25-30 pounds. So I am two days away from my third month and only gained 1 pound. I'm ok with that.
