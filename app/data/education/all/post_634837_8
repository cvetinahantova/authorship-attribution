sullen sky.  your coattails leave a trace, a wet path across the varnished parquet.  it is so cold.  The time to rouse oneself is already passed. That is not true but no one believes in themselves  anymore.  With my brown jacket i wrap my body, my soul, intent on walking these streets to find life for heaven's sake.  it is too cold  for this time of the year or so the complaint of everyone goes.  But i cannot help what i dream, what compels me to wander and journey for all the passing of time.   Surely even the grave cannot hold  me for my dwelling place lies not in its grim predictions and gloom.  Few find the narrow path, fewer  remain on it and reach your throne.  But where the coldest winds  dwell, where the sleeping giants lie, where the heights reign over mortal lives, there I will journey. I will chart the wilderness of the heart, and once entering into death  will only pass it by  and gain entrance to my father's heart.
