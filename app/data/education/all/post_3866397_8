Lightning sucks.  Especially when you're in the lightning capital of the Western world and you're responsible for phones and data.  Between mediating for three vendors and having to replace 85% of our phone system yesterday, my patience with nature is at an all-time low.  Unfortunately, hurricane season is just getting started.  So how would one cope with such stress?  I decided to watch Training Day.  Denzel as the crooked cop- I liked it.  It was a very dark, intense movie from start to finish.  Denzel managed to give a potentially 2-dimensional character type some real depth, with flashes of redemptive qualities that lasted just long enough for you to really dislike him the rest of the time.  It's not for everyone, but it's good for what it is.  If you like The Shield on FX, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  In closing, I'd like to thank Netflix for making movie watching so easy for me.  Seriously, this is a great service.  I've watched more movies since I've joined than I ever would have rented from Blockbuster.  When you can get three at a time delivered to your door and all you have to do is drop them back in the mail to get a replacement, it makes traditional renting a lot less attractive.  No time limits, fast delivery, and I haven't had a problem with any of the movies yet.  I have at least one movie at home at any given time, so if there's a night when TV sucks, I have options.  They have all the new releases and a ton of older stuff Blockbuster doesn't carry.  Therefore you'll be seeing short movie reviews regularly on this page.  In fact, I'll probably come up with some sort of weekly format for my posting in the next few days so that there's some structure to it all.
