We drove quickly through the midwest, on the interstate most of the time. It was lovely—lush, rolling, green hills, with lots of hardwood trees. The countryside looked prosperous, well-tended, tidy. But we needed to make up for lost time, so we drove through southern Illinois and Indiana.   Kentucky had even more of these positive traits. The countryside is just luscious. We drove by a retirement ranch for thoroughbred horses. The city of Louisville looked surprisingly glamorous too. It has some stunning skyscrapers.   We stopped to eat in Lexington, and found a very good Indian restaurant. Moritz had to stay in the car  of course while we were eating, but we did walk through the town with him. It’s very old. Transylvania University is there, and it is one of the oldest private colleges in the country, founded in 1780.   Although Kentucky looks great from the highway, when you get up close there is a feeling of decay about many of the buildings. Although the weather has been very pleasant for much of this trip, it felt tropically humid in Lexington, which added to the sense that the foundations of the mansions were rotting.  I exaggerate a bit, of course.  We’re now in West Virginia. We wanted to get to West Virginia today so that we could spend some time in the Appalachians.tomorrow.
