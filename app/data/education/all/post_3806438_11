This year's olympic games seem to be wimpering away before they een start. First of all, the buildings aren't even built yet. What's up with the Greek people? Aren't they the people who invented civilization? They can't build a freaking stadium?    Secondly, thanks to all these security concerns, and maybe because they heard that the buildings weren't built yet, most of the tickets to the events  urlLink  aren't even sold yet . Freaking terrorists are ruining the olympics. In fact, they think that they'll have fewer tourists in Greece this year than they had last year. That's some ill shiznit.    Could I say 'freaking' some more?
