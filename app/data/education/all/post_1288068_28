I had a blog. It was good. I wrote every day! I had about 20000 words, which I think is about novel-length. Wow. Sadly, stuff happened, I lost my blog-groove and deleted it all this morning. In many ways it feels good. In other ways it feels freaking awful.  I'm sorry everyone: I'm glad you liked my old blog.  xxx
