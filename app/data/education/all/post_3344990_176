urlLink MSNBC - German cannibal sentenced to 8 1/2 years   Highlight this statement in your brain and see if you can BELIEVE this lunatic actually said this in court.   "I had my big kick and I don't need to do it again," he said. "I regret it all very much, but I can't undo it."   ONLY 8.5 years for killing and EATING his victim. Can we really believe that anyone in their right mind would WANT to be stabbed to death and eaten by a stranger????    Come soon Lord Jesus, come soon!!!!
