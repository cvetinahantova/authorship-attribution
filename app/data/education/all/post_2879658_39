Hey y'all!  Guess what?  The moment many of you have been waiting for has finally arrived.  My pictures are now online and you can check them out if you'd like.  There are several albums for my China trip as well as pictures from different events and experiences in Japan. All you have to do is check out this web address: www.ofoto.com, type in my email address (friedmanlindsey@lycos.com) and type in the password  linzinjapan .  Enjoy my photos!!!  I tried to set it up as a link but for some reason it didn't want to work for me.  Unfortunately not all of the pictures are labeled yet because the titles didn't transfer from my cd to ofoto...I am going to do my best to get as many of them labeled as possible.  Oh yea, the southeast Asia winter trip pictures(Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore) are not posted yet.  Sorry but I felt a bit guilty after spending the entire morning at school uploading pictures.
