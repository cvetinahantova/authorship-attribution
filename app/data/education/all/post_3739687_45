hello,  well i went and looked at laptops today.  fun fun.  i basically got a crash  course in computers from a friend.  thank god for computer geeks.  anyway...    other than that not much has been going on i ate some great food on the  dinner cruise.  unfortunately i was seated on the end so i missed some of  the sights, but hey the wine was good.  also, the food was great and the new  people i met were all cool.  there were lots of canadians on the trip for  some reason.  well school starts tomorrow.  yuck.  i'll be doing lots of research and also  we are moving into a new building so i'm sure it's going to be anarchy.  gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Discover the best of the best at MSN Luxury Living. http://lexus.msn.com/
