Not much new to say.  I've been whipping myself into shape since I've been back.  Despite the fact my gym pretty much sucks I've been getting a lot of quality time in there and I'm beginning to notice a difference.  Gabe's birthday is tomorrow.  I'll be going out there I think.  I haven't been in that part of town for a long time.  Should be a nice change of scenery.  I was gonna take these new online quizzes but I'm too pooped.  I might do that later.  I really don't have squat to say.  Stuff is pretty normal.  Time is beginning to pick up and move really quick again.  I'm looking forward to the weekend, should be fun.
