22766 "II" - The Words You Just Said   Please dont I cant bare it I feel scared I cant take it  The words you just told me The moment it came out of your lips As if a sharp wooden arrow Shot out of a bow  It hit me Hit me hard in case you dont know As if my whole body suddenly sank on snow Not just skin deep, but down to my very bone  Now Im left here Pondering on what you just said More self-assuring than being deaf I'd rather have myself be dead
