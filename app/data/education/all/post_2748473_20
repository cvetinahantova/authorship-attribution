I finally got my bloodwork done today so I hope that we can get all of this stuff sorted out pretty soon. I miss me some Jesus and feel a million miles away from any of that. I miss Ashley too, but maybe we will be close friends one of these days. It's so hard to see her because she is so busy. Work is pretty chill. All these kids are pretty nuts and some of them listen, so I will just stick it out and keep on trucking.  The more and more I go through life and truly look at things, I wonder where the world is going and what my purpose in it is. I have always have this gut feeling that something big is gonna happen in my life and I just don't know what it is right now. I have always had this feeling that I'm gonna die for something I believe in, which feels odd feeling this way.  I love you all and hear is a nifty song for all of you:  see all those people on the ground wasting time i try to hold it all inside but just for tonight the top of the world sitting here wishing the things I've become that something is missing maybe I... but what do I know   and now it seems that i have found nothing at all I want to hear your voice out loud slow it down without it all I'm choking on nothing it's clear in my head and I'm screaming for something knowing nothing is better than knowing at all
