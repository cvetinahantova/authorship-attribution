I hate weekends.  I'm quite unmotivated today.  Maybe its because I drank too much wine last night, or maybe I don't feel the press of homework assignments, although I should.  I haven't done any productive work, in regards to school, since Thursday night.  I hate being unproductive, and I become somewhat depressed when that occurs.  That makes me less motivated, which then means I produce less, become more depressed, and so on.  This is one of the most frequent obstacles I encounter.
