READ  Message: Lady : Why do you like me..? Why do you  love  me?      Man : I can't tell the reason.. but I really  like you..      Lady : You can't even tell me the reason... how  can you say you like me? How can you say you  love me?      Man : I really don't know the reason, but I  can prove that I love you.   Lady : Proof? No! I want you to tell me the  reason. My friend's boyfriend can tell her why  he loves her but not you!      Man : Ok..ok!!! Erm... because you are  beautiful,    because your voice is sweet,   because you are caring,   because you are loving,   because you are thoughtful,   because of your smile,  because of your every movements.    The lady felt very satisfied with the man’s  answer. Unfortunately, a few days later, the  Lady met with an accident and became comma.  The Guy then placed a letter by her side, and  here is the content:    Darling,    Because of your sweet voice that I love you...   Now can you talk? No! Therefore I cannot love  you.     Because of your care and concern that I like  you..   Now that you cannot show them, therefore I  cannot love you.      Because of your smile,   because of your every movements that I love you..   Now can you smile? Now can you move?   No, therefore I cannot love you...      If love needs a reason, like now, there is no  reason for me to love you anymore.    Do love need a reason? NO!    Therefore, I still love you...    And love doesn't need a reason       Sometimes the best and the most beautiful  things in the world  cannot be seen, cannot be touched, but can be  felt in the heart
