urlLink Professional School Counselors Can Make Positive Connections with Homeschoolers. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Gloria Dansby-Giles.  It examines the issues around school counselors and home schooled students.  From the ERIC Digest:  The homeschooling movement has grown in popularity as evidenced by the involvement of an estimated 1.2 million students (Lyman, 1998) and cooperative programs offered by schools. Homeschoolers' contact with public schools has encompassed part-time enrollment, dual enrollment and participation in extracurricular activities such as sports (Angelis, 1998). Fager and Brewster (2000) documented homeschoolers' use of computer labs, on-line courses, chat rooms, e-mail and phone support from supervising teachers. There is, however, a sparsity of research dealing with the participation of homeschoolers in school counseling programs. This is an excellent opportunity for counseling professionals to reach a new population of students in need of counseling and guidance services. The extension of services to homeschoolers would involve community outreach, could better enhance community relations and build partnerships that are beneficial to homeschoolers.    This digest will describe reasons for homeschooling, characteristics of families who homeschool, the status of public and home school relations, and ways professional school counselors can make positive connections with homeschoolers.
