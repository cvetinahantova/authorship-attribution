eric just called... first thing out of his mouth, "hey!  so i'm a real person again!"  he had to give the number theory seminar talk this week which means he's mostly been locked in his room for the past 7 days stressing about it and cramming his head full of modular forms and crazy stuff like that without even time for a starbucks run... since eric's my chief partner in crime around here though, that makes for a little bit of me being bored when we'd otherwise be on ferry hunts or graveyard hunts or csilag bulis or something... anyhow, i'm glad his talk is done so he's unstressed again.  tonight's going to be a little different... there's always no math nght, which, this semester is dinner and cards at jared's house every time... however, john's girlfriend is visiting this weekend, jared's girlfriend is apparently visiting every weekend now, and jared's best friend and his wife are both supposed to be around too.  i'm in a weird mood and all about dealing with people i know, but not as much about dealing with lots of people i don't... eric's not so keen on playing cards as much anymore, so we made a pact so show up at jared's for dinner, then leave after for starbucks and a movie (either star wars or renting something we both actually agree on)... who knows.  i'm just glad my friend is back to being a real person again =P
