Well, time has passed.  The rather regretful love continues to consume me at the same rapid pace. I think just seeing her again started it all over again...  This is not hell, nor am I out of it.  That girl simply did not realise what she did to me. It was something that was hard to describe, even back in the day when it was pure and untouched. Now, it's even worse. Because she fuckin'  hurt  me, and what the hell did I get for it? Lies, pain, and sorrow! I simply cannot believe that girl. But I still want to talk to her about it, at least in a circumstance where I can tell her what happened, and where her "friends" can't screw it up.  Bloody hell, but I want payback. I still  want  to forgive her, but that's more of a forlorn dream of days past. Forgiveness is something that's very hard to give, especially under such circumstances as these.  My taste in music isn't helping either, since much of it is shifting towards sappy rock love/regret songs... probably because of the mood I've been in since June, when I started downloading craploads of the stuff. A coping device, if you will.  All I can do is hope and pray that Britney will come on MSN sometime soon, and I can begin dealing with this shite again.  But , this time, I'll be prepared. I'd better be. I better get a plan.  "Yer average Russky don't take a dump without a plan, son."  Well, except I'm not Russian. But the comment still applies.  Alex said that I could just substitute names in this, and make a romance novel out of my life. A possibility, I must admit. But for the time being, I'll just wallow in misery, mull this over, and create a plan to fix all of this. It'll fail, no doubt, but sometimes people have to sacrifice something so they can find the truth. That letter was an example. It  did  show me the truth, after all.
