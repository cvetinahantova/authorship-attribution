Today I begin Amble Forth!  I have lived in Portland, Ore. for just over seven years now, which is long enough to have observed the place in some depth but not so long as to have accepted the conditions here as routine. This blog will chronicle my observances of life in the mildly moist city I have chosen as a current roosting spot.       There are many oddities and wonders here, starting with our peculiar habit of referring to the place as 'Portland, Ore.', rather than simply 'Portland, OR.' as our more efficient neighbor states do. Why the extra 'e'? Who the heck knows, but we seem to like it that way since I see it posted everywhere. Perhaps it is telling that I see it posted most commonly on the sides of commercial trucks on my daily commute between Bridgetown and Salem.
