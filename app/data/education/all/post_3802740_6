I finally received a gmail account.  For some reason, or another, I have really been looking forward to receiving an invitation and trying out the new technology.  I guess it is the geek in me that really looks forward to new technology and trying out new things.  Now, I am not one of those people that would go on ebay and pay a few dollars for one, I simply wanted the experience!  Our kitchen project is coming along nicely.  I finished up taking off all of the wallpaper and Lora has put the first coat of paint on the crown molding.  Hopefully I will get around to floating the seams in the wood paneling to make it appear as one smooth wall, instead of the classic 70â€™s wood paneling.  It is going to really look nice once we are all said and done with it.
