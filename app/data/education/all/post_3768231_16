Weekly World News...   The home of " Bat Boy "! Those bleedin' Yanks will believe anything! I was listening on ABC radio National to ex-journo's who used to work for this weekly American trashy tabloid magazine, and people would contact them  all  the time asking where they could see/meet the things an/or people they allegedly reported about in their articles! It's  creative journalism  at its' best! The legendary "Bat Boy" even went on to become a musical - can u  believe  it?!? pmsl! Have a good laff at this stuff.   http://www.weeklyworldnews.com         Cyalayta           MalÂ          :o)      Message Board -  http://malboard.cjb.net     Blog Diary -  http://malnews.cjb.net   Home -  http://maljam.cjb.net      mal@maljam.cjb.net
