t was early evening in the Queen Vic, and Daniel was settling down to a pint of Coffee. The pub was filling up and Alfie was enjoying some banter with the locals.  All of a sudden, Darren burst into the bar, after a hard day's work as as a top class Porn Star. Darren was out of breath, and gasped, "Help us out mate. There's a bit of trouble at the launderette – Pauline's tearing her hair out!"  "Sorry love, I can't. I’ve got to play Badminton at the Slaters round at Deodrant Lane", exclaimed Daniel. "Oh, be a mate Daniel", pleaded Darren "there's an enormous Fox sitting outside the launderette, and no-one can get their service washes back!"  "All right" sighed Daniel. "Seeing as you're a mate I'll help you out". "Cheers," said Darren, "I need to get my pants back before tomorrow."  They rushed round to Bridge Street as fast as their little legs could carry them. Sure enough, there was a great big Fox glued to the spot. Dot was trying to tempt it away from the door, but the Fox snarled and roared.  As if from nowhere, Billy appeared outside the launderette, brandishing a huge Carrot! The Fox pulled itself up to its full height, and towered over him. It rolled its eyes and lunged at Billy, swiping the Carrot away. Daniel and Darren shook in terror, fearing what the Fox might do next...  The Fox munched on the Carrot, and then spotted the fruit and veg stall. It lunged but toppled backwards and crashed through the launderette door.  Daniel gasped as a flurry of clothes rained down from the sky. Alfie ran out into the street and was blinded as Darren's pants flew into his face! "Never mind," said Pauline. "I'll put the kettle on." The Fox ran off towards Deodrant Lane as Daniel, Darren and Alfie collapsed in fit of giggles.
