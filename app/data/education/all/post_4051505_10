hi this is my first entry and i'm doing it cos jade persuaded me to so sorry if its really awful. today i am the most bored person alive and i'm waiting until meg finishes work so me, jade, meg and sara can go to the woods with a picnic trying to spook ourselves with horror stories and the fact that everytime we go down there we hear whistling following us. i try to be logical about it but i really do think there's something going on down there. apparently someone died. and this time we're going to have some bloke called ralph palmer following us cos we sat in his bird hut. seriously, we sat in a dead guy's bird watching hut and didn't read the sign til we were all inside, making ourselves at home. 'this birdwatching hut is in memory of ralph palmer, who made many contributions to the nature reserve and who enjoyed frequent visits to the area. he was found here.' very comforting to know that a dead body was found in the bird hut you've just gone and sat in. then we sat on philip clarke's bench, but by then we couldn't be bothered anymore. ralph and phil obviously do some late night drinking by the lake when death gets tough. phrase for the day- WE CAN'T WIN!
