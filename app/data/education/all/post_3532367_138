Went to the Doc's again this morning, looking to get time off work. She was very reluctant to do anything though as in her words "it would be a slippery slope" and I wouldn't be getting back for some months (until after my mental health referral at least - 3 months down the line). She did offer me 2 weeks off on the basis that it would be non extendable, but she explained that she wants me to carry on at work unless I start to be a risk to myself or others.  My options now are 2 weeks off, then back to work in the short term (probably not feeling any better) or sit it out and wait until I chin someone at work or want to jump in front of a bus, in the knowledge that I would get long term time off.  Somehow the second option seems more appealing.....
