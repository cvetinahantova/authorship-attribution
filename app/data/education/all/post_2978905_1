Hello.  This whole bit is actually new to me.... I was reading someone's Blog.. I figured that since I like typing a lot, and I traditionally have nothing exciting to say... someone might want to read that.  So... yeah.  I also like to type those dots a lot, so you will have to get used to it.  I know it is a terribloe habit for an english teacher to get into... although I will never say "cuz".  That is just plain irritating.  As you have noticed, I have already managed to type a whole paragraph on absolutely nothing... it's what I am good at.  Welcome to.. this is my brain speaking.  I am sure we will get relatively well acquainted.  Cheers.
