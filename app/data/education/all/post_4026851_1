From the Junk E-Mail file... 7-30-04    FROM:  Wowoffers     SUBJECT:  Eliminate your bills the Christian way     MESSAGE:  Eliminate up to 70% of your debt the at   urlLink  ChirstianDebtRemovers.org   , debt elimination based on Christian principles.   I've prayed and prayed for a lottery score or computer error that would aid me in the polishing of my abysmal credit report, but He hasn't blessed me with those just yet. What exactly  is  the   Christian way of getting out of debt? Stapling gospel tracts to my payment checks?  I had to click. I had to know.  The Christian way is apparently not much different than "the worldly" way. This group's philosophy (paraphrased): join our service (for free), and we'll help you arrange payments and save a little cash in the process. We just recommend that you pray, etc. to help control your spending and make your payments on time. And we're a non-profit organization because charity is Christian, right?  Haha.   "A majority of churches in the U.S. are struggling financially because their members are struggling financially. Titheing (giving the church 10% of your income each week or month) is done by approximately only 20% of a church's members."  Pretty slick... get us out of debt so we can get  them  out of debt... To them I quote themselves:   "Learn to Trust God - God knows what you need, and the things you want, before you ask. Begin to trust Him for the things you need but can’t afford - He will provide. Understand that God will always give you what you need if you believe in Him. Make all financial decisions based on the principles of God’s Word, not the "wisdom" of the world."   And while you're at it, pray for the proofreaders of your spam. WWJD if He saw that typo? John 11:35!!
