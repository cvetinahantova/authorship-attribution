Until now, I have abstained from mentioning the current vice president.  But then I read about how Haliburton is being investigated for misleading financial statements in 1998 and 1999, when the bionic VP was president of the company (as opposed to now when he the president of the United States).                Do you know that our troops were asked to pray for the president?  It happened.  Here’s a link to the presidential prayer team.  You can sign up.  You can “adopt a troop.”    urlLink http://www.presidentialprayerteam.org/   The current President is a born again Christian.  Which means that he believes that me and you (assuming that you are not a Christian) are going to hell because we don’t accept Jesus as our personal savior.   HE BELIEVES THIS!
