Tomorrow is da game!!!    Â  Just thinking...I never keep up with basketball anymore. I sorta lost interest when the Bulls went down, after stupid Michael Quit! Anyways, suppose it's sorta cool now. It's the Lakers against the Timberwolves..suppose I'll cheer my home team! Maybe Shaq will shoot something other than a 1 pointer....as if!   Ohhh...if I only I could see the Gophers go to the finals again, and have them go against Arizona.....that was greeeatt...wow that was years ago!
