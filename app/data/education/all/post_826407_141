Connect on Saturday night was amazing.  D3 are a group looking at mission to club culture so their take on church was informed by that.  Worship was DJ/VJ based with a few well selected tracks providing the sonic background.  There was no "worship leader" as such but instead a loose liturgy of images and words led us this made it feel beautifully decentralized and yet there was a definite process or journey made.  I Personally found it so liberating to be able to go a bit wild with the dancing again.  Powerful.  The guys also prepared some very thought provoking prayer stations some of the negative attitudes about club culture.  After the celebration of beats and visuals in worship it was very useful then to dwell on the "darker" side of the rave generation lifestyle (drugs, sex etc.) and gave the evening a bit of balance. It was also a great chance to pray.    The Alter piece for the evening was superb.  A couple of decks and a few empty bottles,  I loved the symbolism of it.  Celebrating something and sacrificing it at the same time.  Took a couple of pictures and I'll put it all up here if they're any good.  The whole thing got me thinking about something that's been bubbling over for a while in my mind.  That is the theology of cut and paste (WARNING - Potential pretentiousness coming up.  Sensitive types may want to avoid).  OK, here goes.  A good DJ or VJ samples and images from loads of different sources - often stuff that has been disregarded or lost up until that point as well as the current cool tracks videos or whatever.  Then through their work on the decks or the whatever it is VJs use (maybe this goes for found object art, blogging and other stuff too) they reinvigorate them, turn them into celebration into music, into dance.  Thus the discarded, the mundane and the "top ten for this week forgotten tomorrow single" all take on new life to set the dancefloor alive.        Now, doesn't Ezekiel talk about Dry Bones hearing the word of God and taking on new life?  So couldn't the hands on the decks become more than just a DJ.  Couldn't they become prophetic acts, symbols of the work of God?    Just an undeveloped thought from a non-djing, non-theologian-  may come back to it in the future.  (btw- my listening during that last post was the superb new Album " urlLink Ten " by cLOUDDEAD, They're a trio making US, White-Boy, Electronica-Hip Hop.  This is (I think) their second album.  Haven't got it yet, just listening to it on the  urlLink Ninja Tune  website.  Bit like DJ Shadow, The Beta Band, Beck and Boards of Canada jamming together, but better.  Very memerising and beautiful stuff.  I may have to make a purchase soon.)
