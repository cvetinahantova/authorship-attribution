You know, I was genuinely excited this morning to wake up at 6am to find that the first series of the Animals of Farthing Wood was on tv. I felt about 13 again. And it was the exciting episode, where fox is swept away by debris! Thrilling. The question is, do I want to wake up early again tomorrow morning? More shock at the news of my departure today. I do feel very sad at the thought of leaving, but relieved also. It feels like it's 3am and I'm tired, and I can't go to sleep for a few hours but, when I do, it will be the best sleep ever. I was thrilled to just receive an email from TFPL agency asking if I wanted to be put forward for a job. It looks like a good job too; the only problem is that it's temporary. If there's a possibility it might lead to something permanent I'd go for it. I'm torn between going for it anyway because I as yet don't have a job, or holding on and waiting. Does look like a cool job though. I've gone all day just drinking water. I'm ever so proud of myself. I am now deliberately leaving my purse at home so I'm not tempted to nip to the shop to get a bottle of coke. Dammit, I will beat my caffeine addiction this time! I can't let it beat me. Ugh, stiff neck. Might go and bake some more Anzacs now. Last night's batch were yummy (but a bit burnt) but then again, the recipe was new...
