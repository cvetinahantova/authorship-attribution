I got an e-mail today about a  urlLink petition  to sign to extend the assault weapons ban after this year. It is being spread by a father of one of the kids killed in the Columbine shootings. The cool thing is that you can track the petition, so I can track who has signed the petition because of me. Make sense? Well, if you agree with me and would like to see the assault weapons ban extended, go here and sign this petition.
