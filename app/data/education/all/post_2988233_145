I am officially seraching for a new blog host.  The jerk who asked me that really stupid question has ruined it for me.   I can't believe whoever that was asked me that.    I have deleted the comment and banned the person, but still I don't want this person reading about my life, so I am switching blogs.  As soon as I find one I like.   To me, my blog is quite enjoyable.  I love blogging.  I guess the comment before jsut opened my eyes to what perverted idiots there are in this world.  And it also brought the realization that those same perverts are reading my blog.    Tommy was very upset about it.  HE found it first.  He was reading my blog, while I was working on templates, and IM'ed me wanting to know what was going on.  So thanks, whoever you are.  I really appreciate the life lesson.
