NOT! only 17 yr old girls named Ashley.. the rest of you suck! haha jk.. todays theme seems to be age.  i'll just go see something rated R tonight and make myself feel better lol.     Amy-- no one is naked.. just shirtless lol.     speaking of shirts, i saw some funny ones today:   sex is like snow. you never know how much you'll get or how long it will last  forget the bull - ride the cowboy  i refuse to play well with others before noon    really i just wanted to see how the quote thingies work haha. i'm such a dork.. alright so yesterday was fun. i really didn't do much of anything.. big suprise huh? lol. i laid around the house all day. Andrew went to Nick's, John and dad went to play poker, and mom went to a party with some girl friends (and had a mudslide with out me!) so i went over to Phil's and we hung out till 8:30 or so and then we went grocery shopping. which was fun. for some reason doing that kinda stuff with someone who isn't related to you just makes it more fun. maybe i'm just weird. that could be it.. anyway. after that we went back to his apartment and watched south park. and then i went home and i was on time for the first time since i started dating him and no one was even here...    as for today.. my parents and  Sheila went with me to get my senior pics done. the photographer noted my mad skills when it came to posing so my mom brought up the baby pagent thing.. i was like 5 when we stopped that lol. oh well. i really hope they come out ok! i know i'm cute but the whole fake smiling thing can make anyone look goofy.. (i'm not conceited i'm confident, besides i'm not the only one who thinks that! hehe).  after that we went to cici's. i love their pasta and dessert pizzas.. lol. i decided i really wanna try ddr but i don't want to look like a total retard and i just have this feeling i'd be awful at it! lol.. that was random..
