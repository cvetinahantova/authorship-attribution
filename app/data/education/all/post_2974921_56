my soul tells me i am dreaming and so my body agrees i feel that this is bliss in closed eyes and if consciousness will keep me from this moment then in eternal sleep i shall stay if to slumber forever is to pass on then to death i shall surrender...  those lips and eyes possessed by an angel with the touch of feather and the breath of breeze with the warmth of spring  the thrill of summer I fall for you my soul is pulled out of me to you as if it was all meant to be under the gloomy skies and chilling wind I long for you…  A kiss will end this anxiety And start a new moment A kiss will suffice for this day’s desire One contact will let me die And fall to the deepest It shall drive to chaos with peace The kiss will be the first..
