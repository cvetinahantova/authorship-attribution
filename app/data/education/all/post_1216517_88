yogi bear knows how to stare down would be terrorists.  kinda like nic cage, except in real life.  yog' masquarades around with all those picnic baskets and mr. ranger sir, but in actuallity he's a double agent with an amazing ability plus quite an extensive an all-inclusive vocabulary.  boo boo?  he's a dupe.  a cuckhold.  he doesn't know his ass from his elbow.  probably stoned all the time, should go hang out with shaggy in the back of the mystery machine.  too bad yog' didn't hang out with snagglepuss, he was one dope dude.  i've tried to love huckleberry hound, mostly because he's got such a cool name, but to no avail.  snag' was tops.  can you imagine him and yog' crusing around jellystone in mr ranger sir's jeep.  that'd be sweet.  yog' pimping it with honey bear, who in my opinion was one foxy foxy tune.  of course should couldn't touch betty rubble, jessica rabbit, kim bassinger in cool world, or belle, well, while we're at it we might as well throw in ariel, snow white, cinderella and sleeping beauty (i'm not really a betty boop fan), but for all intents and purposes, as far as animal tunes goes honey is a hottie.  minnie ain't bad.  daisy duck, no.  but yog' definatly knows how to pick em.  i wonder if she knows about his double life as a secret agent.  'the negotiator' was origionally going to star him, but yog' didn't get along with the director.  it goes back to some arguement they had at acme university.  yog' played a big part in a recent flare up in the west back.  he didn't get much press though.  i think it's speciesism.  just because he's a bear gives the press no right to deny him credit.  oh well, it's an uphill battle for the furry ones, but God willing, it's one they can overcome, so that one day we will all be equal.
