Christmas and New Year's went by so fast!! Wow, it's already 2004. I graduate next year! YEAH! Once again I was blessed by Brynn and her mom, they called from Kentucky to wish me a Merry Christmas and also to see if I got my puppy. Well I didn't get my puppy unfortuneately but it was a sweet thing to call. I really tried not to be to disappointed when my gift wrapped puppy didn't come, but I couldn't help it. I was so sure he was coming this year. But I did get a Mastiff calendar from Santa (a.k.a Cela). It was nice to see all the family this holiday, my great aunt Carmen was here so we hung out with my grandma and her two sisters (one which is Aunt Carmen), it's so funny when they get together because they bring out a bottle wine and it is finished by the end of the night. Hilarious, they are so funny.  So I was asked the other day if I would do a musical for the youth group, I am getting really excited about it. I watched Jesus Christ Superstar, and I love it! I can't wait to get started! I got some background music for the play so I won't have to hire a band. So I just have to learn the songs myself and start thinking about who will be best for which part, and start auditions. What fun!! How cool we are going to do a musical! Gabe said that he would sing for me, and Amber said that she could dance as long as she doesn't have to sing. Awesome!
