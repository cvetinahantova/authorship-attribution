I am overexcited because Jim is coming all the way from the Shire to meet us for drinks in Greenwich. You may recall that the last time we saw him was for the boy's birthday, when we inadvertently offended the mild mannered patrons of a fine Greek establishment in Fitzrovia. Ah, the revelry of youth.  On Friday we had lots of fun at the theatre, not least because we got our seats upgraded to the very fancy dress circle. I used the little binoculars to look very very closely at what the extras were doing during party scenes. Afterwards we walked to a Chinatown restaurant and were served noodles by the Angriest Waitress in London.  Next week, I plan to knit like a bitch, work on school things, look for a new flat and work some more on Hollywood Blockbuster, which is rapidly looking like a post-apocalyptic episode of Hollyoaks written by a wine-addled till-monkey with a Wodehouse complex. Bloody hell.  Greenwich calls. And not a minute too soon.
