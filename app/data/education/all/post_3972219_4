Before George learned to fly, I took him up flying one day.  He said he had read a book about flying and thought he could do it.  I turned the controls over to him and after flying all over the sky, he said "There may be a little bit more to this than I thought".  He did learn to fly.  He could always master anything he set him mind to do.  He was a wonderful brother-in-law and was always checking on my health because of my cancer.  How could I guess that he would be gone before me.
