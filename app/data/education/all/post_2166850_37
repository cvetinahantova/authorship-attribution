its raining now, and caleb's having tuition, and we all just came back from  paragon , the shopping mall we ate chinese food for lunch at this famous  xiao long bao  restaurant, whose name i can't recall..anyway it was pretty okay, and my dad chose the place for us, but i wasn't too happy coz my dad chose the place on the spot without consulting us and asking us if we wanted to go. i didn't wanna go, for one thing, but i didn't,like, object to his decision coz i didn't think anyone would agree with me if i wanted to go elsewhere that my parents didn't fancy (of course not to spite them, just that they had a very different style of cuisine from what i liked) anyway, i wanted to have a dessert at  starbucks  or even  delifrance , but my parents wanted to shop for groceries at  marketplace , so i went to read magazines, and scouted around the mall basement...and i had to say that there was too much food around and one could be spoilt for choice there...they had stuff like  new zealand's natural  selling smoothies and ice cream, plus  mrs fields' ,  breadtalk ,  nooch noodle bar ,  orange julius  and  bravissimo  italian ice cream...and that was wasn't the end yet! i also went to a cd shop called  gramophone  which is the coolest cd shop i've been to so far...and its cheaper than  sembawang  cd shop, and more user friendly than  that cd shop ...i wish i had bought the  piano songs  cd...but it's too late to do that now...so i'll just wait till the time comes... favourite song for today...did u recognise the title...it's a phrase in the song that hit me today...it's  extraordinary  by  liz phair  here are the lyrics:   You think that I go home at night Take off my clothes, turn out the lights But I burn letters that I write To you, to make you love me  Yeah, I drive naked through the park And run the stop sign in the dark Stand in the street, yell out my heart To make, to make you love me  I am extraordinary, if you'd ever get to know me I am extraordinary, I am just your ordinary Average every day sane psycho Supergoddess Average every day sane psycho  You may not believe in me But I believe in you So I still take the trash out Does that make me too normal for you?
