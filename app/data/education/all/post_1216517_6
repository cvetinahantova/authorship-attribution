RABBITS AND THE AV  I was gonna try and get a map of where i'm going to live and put it here, but i'm not smart enought to do that.  Just look up lancaster, ca on  urlLink mapquest .  I think I'm fairly close to Sequoia National Park.  I'll have to check that out. Moving again...it's such an ordeal.  It's hard to think of anything i hate more.  and yet, there's this excitement that comes along with it.  Anything new has that expectant thill of the unknown, for a little while at least.  My big thing used to be pets.  I ran through 'em by the dozens when i was younger.  And even more recently with a rabbit named sanchez.  The story of sanchez begins as thus: I asked  urlLink matt maust   to catch a few pints with me.  Afterwards we headed over to the mall to walk off our beverages andit was then that i thought it would be a good idea to purchase a rabbit.  For a while, sanchez was all the rage.  Then, a detriation began.  First, i let her hop the yard freely.  Then she ran away.  And that's the story of sanchez.  Keith, in particular, objected to my treatment of sanchez.  He said that a rabbit needs food and water.  Now that's neither here nor there so i won't debate such a petty arguement.  But i will admit there was a steep decline in pure rabbit affection from the moment i purchased sanchez.  There was the inital excitement, then the waning emotion, then neglect, and eventually the release.  Whoa.  Hold on.  Am i talking about a rabbit or my female relationship trends?  And i will be the first to answer:  that is neither here nor there and i am in fact discussing a hare.  So to rapidly transition to a less abrasive subject and to get back to the task at hand...Yes, i am excited and dreading this move to the valley where the antelope roam freely and the lion lies with the lamb.  Although...if that's what it's like, it can't be half bad, hey?
