Today I feel... floaty. Not good floaty though; the kind of floaty when you can't really decide what to do and where to go- the kind of floaty when you feel you can't land next to anyone because everyone's doing something that seems far more important than talking to you. I felt very out of place wherever I went, like I wasn't quite... accepted isn't the word- It didn't feel like I fitted in anywhere, but like I was just going around after people, and everything I did or said was slightly innapropriate, or odd. Floaty.  Ceff x   If I was someone else, would this all fall apart?
