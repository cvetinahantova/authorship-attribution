so that girl did end up coming over tonight but brought one of her guy friends with.  his name was dave (great name...my life seems to not be able to get away from people named dave...a lot of times i think i'm destined to end up with a dave).  anyway, while her and my housemate were off romping around, dave and i had a really great conversation.  the first real conversation i've had in a long time.  it seemed like we had quite a bit in common so the conversation just flowed.  at times it was a little awkward because he kept talking about his last relationship and what went wrong, but i could definitely relate to the situation and i know how nice it is to find someone who will listen so i didn't mind hearing about it the slightest bit.  he seemed really nice.  it almost made me like the girl better, but not quite.  he reminded me of the dave i was friends with last year...both punk, both had mohawks, both intelligent, same good conversation, etc.  i hope he visits again...it was fun.
