How far and how often can you bend your beliefs before they break?   Although, I try to follow a close to vegan eating style, this morning I fell to temptation:   A luscious white-chocolate-bread-pudding served hot and glazed with an orange caramel sauce [from La's Bistro, on Granada Blvd in Ormond Beach [across from the produce market and the library].           It was heavenly. The real problem is that I go to the library at least once a week to do research for class; and La's has always been a nice stop in for a coffee or cappucino [even though their cappucino is a bit bitter for my tastes], a croissant, and some fresh fruit... usually with melons... which aren't my favorite but begger's can't be choosers and like most restaraunts , La's doesn't have a very expansive vegetarian menu.           Now this bread pudding is temptation itself and it's going to be hard not to re-order it despite the eggs. My belief system and lifestyle may not break because of it, but if I keep stopping by on fridays... they're bound to be tarnished.
