Okay, here's something different than dumb news items.  I found this site that basically narrows it all down.  You got your South Beach Diet, your Atkins diet, your Jenny Craig, your eDiets.com diet,etc.  It all can become confusing so for anyone interested in eating healthy here's a website that narrows down the basic idea for any decent diet.  (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040621-650746,00.html?cnn=yes)  DISCLAIMER: None of you are fat so this is by no means a response to someone's obesity.  But I do think Allison was talking about the South Beach diet once before so say she is interested in eating healthy this might be something interesting to look at. Same goes for anyone else.
