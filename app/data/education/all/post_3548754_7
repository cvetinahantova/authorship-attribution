Today's more laid back in terms of work.Hehehehe. As usual, I'm still in the office. I'm waiting for Myk. Badminton daw tonight.   Finally finished doing the time table of the actual wedding day and typed draft of activity flow. Grabe! Kakapagod ayusin yung flow. Thankful I have Mimoy and Apple to meet next week. Need to fix guestlist and table arrangements too.  Texted Tammy of my band. Will meet soon. Haaay... Shucks! Just remembered that I have to bring the additinal stuff to Tita Denise for the AVP.  Hopefully I get to fix the guestlist sometime tomorrow...
