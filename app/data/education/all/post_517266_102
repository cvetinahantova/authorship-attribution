Glendale, Wisconsin - I spoke in Nicolet High School today where I presented five times before noon.  It was a bit nuts, but a lot of fun.  Each grade had a ton of energy and working with the student leaders was rewarding.  Tonight, I spoke with the parents and enjoyed the evening.  Great time in Wisconsin.
