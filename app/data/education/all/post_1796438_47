Posters Included  Here are some of the movies we've seen recently. The Day After Tomorrow, very cool. Lovely special effects, especially with the ice. It was a pity not to see the wolves chasing the little people then getting frozen, but you can't have everything I guess. Harry Potter, also very good (but very packed). I love the Marauders Map, I wish I had one.   urlLink    The Day After Tomorrow  urlLink      urlLink    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  urlLink
