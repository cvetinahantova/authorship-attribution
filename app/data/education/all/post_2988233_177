Seems as if my post yesterday gave my big sis enough fodder for blackmail.  lol.  She called me this morning telling me she's got me now.  (and she does) BUT, if I will drive home, she'll buy me a margarita!  Seems she can't hold her liquor.  Hmmmmm, an arrangement could be made here.  I'm not a margarita girl myself, but a Tom COllins or screw driver would be nice.  Gotta love my vodka.  This could be bad, this could be very, very bad.  Two sisters out, drinking, not a good thing in this family.  Dad would die.  Especially if sis #3 came along.  (shivers) Can't drink with her, she gets violent wants to kick butt, unfortunatly for everyone she takes on, she can back up her words.  I've been on the recieving end of her drunk.  Not a place I ever want to be again.     At least with Big sis, one drink is all it would take.  Then, bring out the cam corder, gotta have a blackmail tape to use against her black mail blog.  This could get very interesting ! lol.
