Last night my sweetie got off early from work and we celebrated by going to the "Lovely Hula Hands" restaraunt off super trendy Mississippi Avenue. It's a remodeled house kind of not near anything, really - hard to find unless you spot its bright pink exterior as you happen to be driving by on the way to somewhere else. It was lovely food, don't know whose hula hands prepared it.  Then we drove out into the Gorge on the Old Scenic Highway, which is still scenic even at night. We stopped at a small park up a few hundred feet elevation from the Columbia River called "Women's Forum Park" (odd name), because it had a low-lit spot for looking at the stars. It was just 20 miles out of Portland, but what a difference it makes to be away from all that light pollution! We lay on our backs in the grass and snuggled as we watched the meteors zip by, and tried to keep over over-excited dog from barking at everyone else.   Our sweet dog is a 70-pound, gorgeous chocolate lab mix from the Multnomah County Animal Shelter. We love her dearly. Although she gets taken to Portland Parks routinely, she almost never goes out at night, and the spookiness of the dark brought out her inner watchdog. She just wouldn't settle down and shut up. After a spell of trying to amuse herself by lying on her back in imitation of us, she grew bored and kept standing over us and goofily looking down in our faces and blocking our view as we tried to look up at the stars, walking on our heads and other body parts, and tangling us up in her leash. She finished her evening banished to the back of the car.   Nonetheless, it was most romantic and a wonderful August evening.
