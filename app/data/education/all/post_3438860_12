I'm sitting in the Mexican restaurant and there is a 10 month old little girl who won't stop staring at my 17 month old little boy.  Dinner is punctuated by the other 7-9 family members occasionally turning to stare at us and the baby's mother apologizing for her daughter staring.  "She's not usually like this," she says.  After dinner, I decide that my son might enjoy going over to see the little girl and spending time with her while Daddy is paying for the check.  While the two kids stare at each other, I'm standing there making chit chat with the other mom about ages, names, and all that other Mommy breeze shooting.  Suddenly one member of their dinner party, a curmudgeonly-looking fellow with a long beard looks at me and says in a commanding voice, "Who are you?"  "Uh... my name is Wendy.  Who are you?"  "Are you a Realtor?"  Suddenly fearful that he'd had a bad experience in real estate, I was hesitant to respond immediately.  Finally I nodded and said yes.  He hit the woman next to him in the arm and said, "See, I told you!  She's that woman we saw in the paper this week!"  His companion nodded in agreement.  They had seen a little article about me in the paper announcing an award I'd received for volume sales.  It had my picture, a horrible squinting picture with very bad hair.  The woman jokingly asked for my autograph.  Gotta love life in a small town.
