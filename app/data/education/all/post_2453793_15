sometimes i think i'm like a 5-year old...you know, the "why?" stage.  i'm constantly asking question after question without response.  nobody wants to answer my questions.  it just causes frustration.  both ways.  there are just so many unanswered questions.  i don't know why i need to find the answers.  i'm not sure what i'd do with them if i had them.  i don't know if they'd solve anything, or if they'd just lead to more questions.  i'm misunderstood.  maybe the problem is that i'm trying too hard to understand and be understood.  where do people like me go to find meaning?  i wish someone knew me.  anyway, here is just a sampling of what's on my mind....  +why are the questions that i ask people in order to understand something so difficult to answer? +why do the people i ask questions to get pissed off at me for asking questions? +why do things have to change? +why can't things go back to how they used to be? +why can't i take life as it comes? +why do guys confuse the hell out of me? +why are all my friendships disintegrating? +why doesn't anyone ever want to share their thoughts with me? +why does my heart feel so bad? +why do i feel so alone? +why am i so indecisive? +why is everybody so damn selfish? +why do guys cheat on me? +why doesn't anyone want to make a commitment to me? +why do i always fall for guys that i can't have? +why must i sleep? +why must i eat?
