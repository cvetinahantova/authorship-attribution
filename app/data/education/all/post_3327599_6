Hey people! Well today was my day off...so of course I worked a few hours today lol.I woke from loud banging this morning.... lol My grandma was continuously banging and I just covered my head and ignored it.....for awhile... I said some pretty words and finally got up.lol see... My manager tried to calling me several times but with my door was shut, so I couldnt hear anything.  so She called my mom and my mom keep calling me and my cell phone. Never got ahold of me so.... lol.... My mom called my grandma and my grandma keep calling and finially came up and started pounding on my door. SO I eventually went to work.. but I only had to work for 3 hours so it wasnt too bad.... welll thats it  nothing else really happened.... well... I almost hit a car... getting on the highway...wel... it almost hit me.. but it was my fault.  If they were like 8 inches closer they would have hit me. thats it. Loves Sheila
