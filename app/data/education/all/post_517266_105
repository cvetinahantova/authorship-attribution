New Jersey - This should be more of my moment of the week.  I have been in Maryland and New Jersey all week long speaking at great schools and to wonderful parent groups.  Today I spoke at the New Jersey State REBEL2 Conference for Middle Schoolers and had an absolute blast.  I am exhausted and ready to head home!
