urlLink Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 2: Recommendations for the Classroom. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Grouws, Douglas A. and Cebulla, Kristin J.   From the ERIC Digest:  The number of research studies conducted in mathematics education over the past three decades has increased dramatically (Kilpatrick, 1992). The results from these studies, together with relevant findings from research in other domains, such as cognitive psychology, are used to identify the successful teaching strategies and practices.   Teaching and learning mathematics are complex tasks. The effect on student learning of changing a single teaching practice may be difficult to discern because of the simultaneous effects of both the other teaching activities that surround it and the context in which the teaching takes place. Research findings indicate that certain teaching strategies and methods are worth careful consideration as teachers strive to improve their mathematics teaching practices. To readers who examine the suggestions that follow, it will become clear that many of the practices are interrelated. There is also considerable variety in the practices that have been found to be effective, and so most teachers should be able to identify ideas they would like to try in their classrooms. The practices are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they tend to be complementary. The logical consistency and variety in the suggestions from research make them both interesting and practical.   For a summary of the research findings on which these recommendations are based, please see the companion to this Digest, "Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 1: Research Findings" (EDO-SE-00-09).
