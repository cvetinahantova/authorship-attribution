It seems as though we might be short on the amount to clear our debts. The 2nd charge on the house has a higher settlement figure than we thought, by 4,000 UKP. The result is we don't have enough to clear our overdrafts and Sandra's Visa. I've asked her if it can all go to clearing my cards as a priority, so that  I am not tempted to spend on them. She seems happy with this, although the dicovery caused some tension.  Just before bed, I decided to take the dogs a walk and while I was out, I did a few laps of the field. I surprised myself by the distance I did, before getting out of breath. By the time I got back, Sandra had gone to bed, so I spent 30 mins on the computer, chatting, while I was cooling down.
