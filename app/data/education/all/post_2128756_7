The thing of it is, I'm scared to go back to school. I don't think I can do it. I'm scared of letting more people down by failing at something else. But what else is there? I always hate being the last to do things, and I feel like I'm in competition with others who've gone before. Am i scared of someone pointing out a lack of genius? Yes. Do I doubt myself? Yes. But what if this is the only way?  The Lion brings doubt.  And doubt brings change. And Change is the only Way.
