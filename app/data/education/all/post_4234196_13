I am in a little early this morning to jot down some thoughts about yesterday.  Guy wanted me to come in at 8:30 a.m., but I am in at 8:00.  I tried to remember everyone's name in the office, but was unsuccessful.  I think that I will remember Peggy, the office manager, next time, though.  Just in case anyone was wondering, when I got home yesterday at 2:45, I slept straight through until 6:00 p.m.  I was exhausted.  One thing that really struck me about the meetings and interactions yesterday was the extent to which student privacy is an issue.  Teachers are not allowed to post or announce any test scores, students cannot grade each others papers (without alot of hoop jumping,) one teacher is not allowed to know the grades of their students in another class.  In Guy's class, the websites that students create for projects cannot be posted onto the Internet, only on the CLP web.  I have even heard that a teacher is not allowed to have any pictures taken with their students that show the identity of the students.  This is an unfortunate consequence of the way the world is nowadays, I suppose.  More later.
