After standing in line on Landsdowne street for 3 hours waiting to get into a jam pakced club, I was not able to see any of the stars that I wanted to see. I guess thats what happens when you are just a lowly peasant and everyone else is in the VIP sections.  The club was very nice. It had to very big bars on each side of the room. I would have guessed that a few thousand people were there. The music was good, the DJ was Biz Markie of early nineties Rap fame. He through out a mix that gave me chills. Some of the music I hadn't heard in a very long time. There were songs he played that took me back to the days of hanging out at Jaime's eastside house. That was a long time ago.  Anyway, the only thing that made the wait to get inside the club bearable, was that across the street there was a game going on inside Fenway Park. The local heros were duking it out with the Evil Empire of New York. I have to say that although the wait was a pain in the ass, getting inside was worth it.
