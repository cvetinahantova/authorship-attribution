another one of those days...  this week is looking like unless i make excuses to run errands, i won't leave the house for 3 days again -- how much fun is that?  read til 2am last night (finished leigh's favorite book yesterday afternoon, and then last night i started  the millenium problems  (about the top 7 most high profile unsolved math problems of today, written in laymen's (i.e. including math people who haven't studie those areas in depth) terms), then slept til 10:30 today, and since then it's been a work in front of the TV day... i'm nearly up to 450 contacts before the site i was working off of had its server go down and my computers started acting retarded... i guess that's a hint that it's breakfast/lunch time?  movie of the AM (was on TV earlier, and started just as i turned the TV on)... "herman USA"... real life story about a town in minnesota who had dozens of single guys and about 6 single girls so they had a huge dance/picnic to attract new blood into town... it was entertaining...  have seen bits and pieces of the memorial stuff being done for president reagan's funeral as i flip through too...  in happy news, i got 2 back issues of "mental floss" in the mail just now... "the spy issue" and "the saints and sinners issue"... they even stuck in a personalized hand-written thank you note for my order :-P  when i finish these, (the only 2 issues not sold out from 2002, their first year in print), i'll start ordering the 2003, and the 2004 issues in 2s and 3s as well =P  party indeed.  exciting articles? "fear of all sums: 3 math theories explained to you in plain english", "for the sake of sake" (2nd sake = japanese wine), and "20 to 30 interesting things you never knew before about japan (but who's counting?)".... party indeed...  now for the texas trophy hunters site to come back up.... ah well... lunch!
