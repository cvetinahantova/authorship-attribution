I remembered my friend and his joke. He got a scholarship to study in Japan. And in his letter, he complained that the first obstacle he had to overcome is not the language, the change of culture, or being homesick, but learning how to throw garbage away? Is it? Or am I kidding? No. I am not kidding. He told me each household has 3-5 trash bins, one for each type of garbage. And making sure which bin to put what is not an easy task to do. That will sound a bit troublesome and less convenient for us, but it will help sanitation workers a lot and the rate of recycling will be increased. And, I looked around my place. Only one hole to throw in everything. In fact, in NUS, there are some special trash bins for stuffs that can be recycled. But maybe they are located at not very convenient places, or the covers are too heavy to push back, or any other excuses on earth that we can think of. The fact is that they are "a bit" empty. I myself have stared at one for some minutes, but I found it a bit difficult to use. In fact I did not know for sure which bin to put which stuffs inside. And, if you take a look at the trash bins outside the LTs, you will find that they are always full of cans: Coca-Cola, Coffee, Soya Bean, to name a few. All those cans can be recycled. But, as they have been put there, I am not very sure how their fate should be.
