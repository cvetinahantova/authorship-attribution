there's just something about being in another country for this long when you really don't plan on staying here for ever. my life pretty much feels like it's on hold while i'm here. yeah, i'm saving money towards my future goals, but other than that, i feel like i'm just trying to waste time. the weeks tend to go by fast (since i work six day work weeks), but i'm nearing my two year mark in korea (that's a cumulative amount obviously), and it feels like i've been here forever.  just the day to day rushing kills me. i'm so not the work all day every day person. my job is pretty easy, so i can handle it for a while, but i'm already starting to lose any and all motivation after five months. i can see my effort for my classes deteriorating. my students still work and learn (somewhat), but my laziness is definitely taking over. half the time, i don't prepare a game for the class any more. not that that is a huge problem. i've been around long enough that i can pretty much come up with something while i'm in class, but it still symbolizes my lack of effort.  i haven't been going out much (which might not be a shock to those of you who know me), but the difference is, i really don't want to do anything. maybe it's the summer heat, but i'd rather just sit and stare at the wall most of the time. sure, i go out on occasion. sometimes a friend or two will come to visit. usually i play video games, work on my web crap, or watch horrible television (which i hate even more here than i did in canada). i'm still waiting on my adbusters subscription to arrive so i'll have something to read ( the only book i brought with me was finished months ago).  hopefully the ends will justify the means for this endeavor. putting your life on hold for this long can definitely take it's toll on you.
