i went out with my flashlight.. and saw nothing.. no quarter.. now i'll have to pay the extra 25 cents by myself! haha jk it was fun and besides i started it.. i threw doggie treats at Teri and Amy.. and Kristine.. I would be lieing if i said that was the first time anyone has thrown things at my car.. Jacob threw stuff at my car.. or was it just Teri and me throwing pop tarts at his van.. i'm pretty sure he threw things too! anyway.. and then there was Nick and Andrew throwing ice (followed by the empty Wendy's cup) AND then some pennies..
