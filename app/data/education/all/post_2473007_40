Bring me back to the place Where my heart began to race, And I could almost see your face     With eyes that saw the unseen.  Faith was new and flames were bright. We walked together through the night, And all I wanted was your light.     My sin has made me unclean.   Hollow spaces in my soul- Sweet revival make me whole; Holy Spirit take control,     Bring a love that's higher. Duty calls and drives me on, Where has my desire gone? Bring me back to mercies dawn.     Fill me with your fire.   My Jesus, I want to want you. Please take me in your arms; And make this empty have to, want to. Open wide the prison bars.     Please fill me up inside with a holy need,     To give you all I am and I want indeed Just to somehow, somewhere find My long, lost Love.
