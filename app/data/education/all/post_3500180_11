Geo exam was alright. It was quite easy, but a little long... I  would  say that I studied a lot of useless stuff, but since I didn’t really study, I can’t say that... -__-  Me did a very bad thing today. I was suppose to meet Hikari and MB at the school’s front rotunda at 12:30 to study together, but I overslept at noon, so I ended up getting to school at 1:30... One hour late…>_  I will go play Survival Project now. It’s an online real time game thingy. Pretty cool. Will update later!   Song of the day : My Happy Ending -  Avril Lavigne .
