Well isn't that special?   And the World gets turned upside down again.  This time it was my turn to talk seriously to someone. A  special  someone, and a beautiful one on top of that (despite her claims to the contrary). Things turned out well... A lot of things that needed to be said were said. I am glad that I found the courage to do it.  I was planning on going to Waterloo this morning, but was exhausted due to lack of sleep. What I did instead was sift through the list of apartments and get the half dozen that most appealed to me. And... Um... I got a new phone.  So, I finally got in contact with my advisor. Surprise surprise... Classes have already started! Oops. Well, there's not much that I can do about it now. So I'm not going to worry. Not that I care anyway... I've got more than my share of happy moments last night.
