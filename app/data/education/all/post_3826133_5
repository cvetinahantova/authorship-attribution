I made it to work on time today!   THREE DAYS THIS WEEK!  Yay!    The Little Dictator is going to the Farm with her CeeCee this weekend.  I have a date with Monkeypants tonight.  Yay!   I'm actually getting work done!  Yay!   I did not clean house last night (boo) but I did hang my "curtain" over my bed and paint my closet door!  Yay!   Monkeypants had Boys Night last night.  They played Master of Orion.  I'm mad that I couldn't go.  I want to game!  I hope he kicked ass.  I'm sure my baby won.  ;)  He did promise to try and set up a LAN party so that I could play soon.  I love him.
