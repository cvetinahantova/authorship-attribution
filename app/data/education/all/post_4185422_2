Day 2 - Operation Stupid School     Hey! How is everybody? I'm ok.  It looks like school is going to give me TONS of homework. I had homework in Health and Geometry. That was like a vacuum.  Anyway, I got it done.  This year is going to be sooooooo much fun in Newspaper, but it's going to be a lot of work as well. I'll learn as I go along. But that's gonna be the fun part.     All right, bye!    Silent    P.S.  I can't wait till Friday! For the weekend and the concert! WOOOHOOO!!!!!
