I found an awesome fan and I'm ordering it tomorrow! Check it out: http://store.coolerguys.com/840556018131.html  That fan is a beast... 75cfm at only 4800rpm! The one I have right now only blows 24cfm at the same speed...    Next I'll just buy a couple tornados for the front and back of my case... and I'm going to flip the cpu fan I have right now upside down so it blows away from the heatsink instead of toward it... Until I've decided whether or not it actually works I'll refrain from calling the manufacturers idiots...    Anyway, I'm off again    Current Music: Better Than Ezra - Ordinary
