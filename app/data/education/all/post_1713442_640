urlLink Poetry and Science Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Davi Walders.  From the ERIC Digest:  Poetry and science? Does this equation compute? Poets, many of whose works have been inspired by science, would certainly answer in the affirmative, including William Carolow Williams, a doctor who continued to make house calls while becoming one of America's major poets.   On a smaller scale, I am a poet and former teacher who encourages the weaving of poetry into all areas of the curriculum, particularly into the sciences. As a collector of poems for many years, I have seen the power that the right poem read at the right moment can have. Paradox, creative thinking, attention to detail, discovery, humor--a good poem carries many of these elements so critical to scientific inquiry.
