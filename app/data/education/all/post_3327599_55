could ya tell i missed my titles? or as John calls them tit-els.. weirdo.. so yeah! i went and saw Shrek 2 tonight i highly recommend it for everyone! it's an awesome movie. we're sexy! i was born that way i don't need a magic potion! i went to see it with Phil. and i ran into Jermy (ashby) and some other girls that i think are bitches so it doesn't matter! the fairy godmother was a little dirty.. talking about sexy tushies.. bad godmother.. so while no one is reading over my shoulder i can add that after the movie Phil and i went back to his apartment and woke up his room mate i'm sure she was very thrilled with that. then we watch Aqua Teen until i had to leave. this curfew thing SUCKS. there is so much more i want to say but.. i can't.. cuz.. suprisingly enough some ppl do read this.. and i don't want someone to know something but i think that someone knows the thing i don't want that person to know but that's ok cuz i kinda want that person to know what it is that i want to say!    haha+lol=hehe
