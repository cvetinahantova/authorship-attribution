With my new found freedom from the flea market I now have the ability to play around with my Web Log format.  I have decided that the Yellow needs to GO and something new needs to take its place.  I also have an RSS feed that is available for your reading pleasure even though I am not quite sure EXACTLY how that will be a benefit to you.  I think that you have to have an RSS compliant reader to view it?  I know that Chris Pirillo over at Lockergnome has been pushing out a lot of information about this so maybe I need to revisit what Chris has been publishing about RSS feeds.  Hopefully my blog will now show up using my new template and the YeLlOw background will be gone.  :)
