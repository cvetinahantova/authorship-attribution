ben and me DID see spiderman 2 tonight... after i sat through "josie and the pussycats" on TV... partly it was on, partly i'd never seen it, mostly amanda claims she cancelled the cable so that today (june 30) was the last day, (even though it's still on now) so i figured i'd make use of the last bit of tv i have in the next month and a half.  before i get into spiderman though, random quote from an astronomy  magazine article i just read that i found funny, before i just go nuts w/ spiderman stuff: "consider the vexation in not knowing with certainty whether you are 3 feet tall or 6 feet tall, or that the distance from chicago to los angeles is 1,000 miles or 2,000 miles.  buying a new pair of slacks or planning this summer's road trip would be a guaranteed headache." (duuuude) :-P  anywho, ben came over for the last half hour of that, and then we saw spiderman... to capture the overall tone, immediately when the credits started rolling the first thing out of ben's mouth was "hey, let me do the 'lara is scared of the movie!' impression!"... he exaggerated, but it was pretty funny (i curl myself in a ball, and hide under my jacket)  really though, after seeing it i could understand why it's gotten such stellar reviews all around... although there were entire scenes i just closed my eyes from and paid attention again later, and there were several points where i just jumped and hid for a bit (much to ben's amusement), i enjoyed it,... the action was quality... the love story was believeable,... and other people were just plain funny.  in the end, it was a good movie... random quotes:  me: dude, what are you laughing at? ben: half naked tobey mcguire, that's what  isn't it time someone rescued you?  I believe there's a hero in all of us who keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.   there, be inspired.  night y'all.
