The next day Vice President Millard Fillmore was sworn in as the 13th president of the United States. He was the second vice president to assume the presidency after the death of a president in office.  Fillmore has been considered one of the lesser U.S. presidents. Yet he was a statesman whose support for the Compromise of 1850 helped to prevent civil war and preserve the Union for ten years. He was also a diplomat whose dispatch of a U.S. expedition to Japan helped open that nation to world trade.  Fillmore was born on January 7, 1800, in what was then the frontier village of Locke, New York. He was the second child of Nathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard Fillmore, who had come from New England. The Fillmores were poor tenant farmers, and young Millard spent his early years working alongside his father.  As he grew older, Millard realized that his formal schooling was meager. He used his spare moments to educate himself. Even while tending a machine as an apprentice to a cloth maker, he found time to memorize the definitions of words from a dictionary.
