I talked to Renee, and the docs confirmed that  urlLink Savannah  is in an ammonia induced coma.  Now they just have to figure out what is causing her ammonia to go up so high.  Infection, virus, bacteria, who knows.    They also heard a heart murmur.  This is a first.  NO one has ever heard one before in Savannah.    She has also finally been moved to the PICU.  Glad she is finally in a room of her own and not in a cubicle on a cot.  I will keep posting updates.
