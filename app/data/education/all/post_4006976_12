The fire is actually much better today.  It's been very stable all night and they are currently building a huge fire break along the miles of forest behind the houses. We're all just crossing our fingers that the wind doesn't pick up this afternoon as is forecast.  The smoke is horrendous though.  I will try to post some pics of it but I don't know if it will do it justice.
