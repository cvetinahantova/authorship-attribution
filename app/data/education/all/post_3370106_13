Deepening commitment to the path requires that I set aside completely my thinking and rest comfortably in the precious, voluminous, ever-refreshing, all encompasing and inspiring embrace of the infinite.  Daily doses of meditation and physical exertion are beginning to work through the years of encrusted denial and abuse.  My body is transforming and healing at the same time that I am mentally, emotionally, and spiritually healing...all words to describe the wholeness of my being.
