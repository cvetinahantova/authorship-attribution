COLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Wouldn't be prudent. So, former President George Bush canceled his solo parachute jump Sunday because of risky winds and instead leaped from 13,000 feet in tandem with a member of the U.S. Army parachute team.   The result was just as exhilarating, said Bush, who landed and slid a ways on his rear as he came to rest near his presidential library.   "This was a day of joy and a day of wonder for the Bush family, certainly for the old guy," said Bush, who made the jump to celebrate his 80th birthday.   About 4,000 people watched from the ground, including Bush's wife Barbara, his son Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.   The solo jump was canceled because of winds and cloud cover. Bush took a practice jump in tandem with Army parachutists earlier Sunday before the crowd gathered.   He said he would like to try a solo jump again but gave no timetable other than "soon." Bush was a Navy pilot in World War II. He parachuted to safety when his plane was shot down. He also leaped out of a plane to celebrate his 75th birthday.   Gorbachev brought birthday gifts: flowers and a bottle of vodka.
