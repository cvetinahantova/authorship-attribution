called my boss... she has work for me starting bright and early at 8:30am tomorrow...  but...  who thought their telemarketing days were over and done 4 years ago?  *raises hand and cheers!*  who was dead wrong and will be making crummy calls 7-8 hours per day for the next week?  *raises hand and scowls*  at least it's more $$ in the bank, right?
