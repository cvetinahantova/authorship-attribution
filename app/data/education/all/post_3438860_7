It could be that she’s so easy-going and accepting. Or, it could be that I’m just plain ornery. Either way, I used to find myself pushing the limits of Ginny’s patience time and time again. What a glorious friend to laugh off my playful attempts at irritation.   Diet Coke in a Can   I was sitting atop Ginny’s narrow bed sipping a diet coke one late winter afternoon. Plain old diet coke – before the days of caffeine free and vanilla and lime flavoring! Two huge pane glass windows overlooked a stretch of grass soggy from the melting snow. Naked yet hopeful trees lined a winding creek which was nothing more than run-off from the parking lot adjacent to the dorm. The cloud-less sky was beckoning blue, and I was antsy to go somewhere.   Wendy and Ginny were involved in something rather important, or so it seemed because they wouldn’t respond to my wanderlust pleading. There were books open and papers spread across the desk. There was music; there always was.   I began tapping my coke can against the wide window sill, first in rhythm with the music and then annoyingly out of sync. The details of what followed are not clear. Ginny probably has an accurate description! I do remember that I was driving everyone nuts including myself, but I refused to stop until Ginny begged me to stop (I think…). For some reason, Ginny wouldn’t lower herself to beg and so I continued. (I realize that there is absolutely no deeply insightful reason for this story. It is just one of those memories that cause me to belly laugh and long for the simple hours.)  At some point Wendy left the room. As with so many of my endeavors, I became bored with my own game and stopped the tapping. When Wendy returned, I switched strategies for a win and claimed that Ginny had pleaded for me to stop.   “Tell Wendy the truth,” Ginny kept saying over and over. I didn’t admit it then, but now the truth is out.
