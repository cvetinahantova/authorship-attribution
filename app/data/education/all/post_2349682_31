I get so excited when youth step up to the bat and do stuff that are out of the ordinary for them. Tonight when Zach and Jake were praying I felt so proud of them like they had just won a medal of honor in the army or something like that. As I was talking to Hannah about it later I just wanted to cry, I love it that these youth are going to be the future men of our church. I love it that now they can pray to God and not worry about what their peers will think and even if they do care they were willing to pray anyways. I love it that they are being men and showing us how cool it is to be a man following God.
