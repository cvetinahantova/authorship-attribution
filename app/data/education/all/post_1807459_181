Fuck, I just finished typing a up a nice entry and the only thing that published was the title.  I'm gonna play some games and blog later.     Ok I feel a little better now.  I just played some counter-strike for the first time in a long time and it felt good.  Basically all you do is run around an shoot people.  Very relaxing.   Ok I won't go into detial as much but I had the ride of my life yesterday, literally.  I wanted to go watch a movie but there was too much traffic (rush hour).  So all the cabbies kept telling me to get a motor bike driver.  So finally I negotiated a price and off we went.  Man I had no clue what I'd gotten myself into.  So there is rush hour traffic and here we are on a bike.  I guess in Bangkok bikes are allowed to lane split (that or they just do it anyway).  This wouldn't be such a big deal if you were doing it at a safe decent speed.  Of course this dude is just racing along like mad.  Weaving in and out of traffic the whole time doing like 50 mph.  Now I had another notable ride in HCMC but this one blew it away.  As exciting as this was I have to say it wasn't exactly safe and in hindsight might have been stupid on my part.  But to his defense he did get me there in one piece and quickly.  I'll never ride like that again.  It was like a rollarcoaster except that you didn't know you were going to get off in one piece.  But no harm done.  Saw "I, Robot".  Good flick. So go my visa to Myanmar and I'm off to book tickets now.  Might catch anohter movie but I don't know.
