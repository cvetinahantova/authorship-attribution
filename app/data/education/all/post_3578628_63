Ya the Reagan death week thing is over, but here's something that isn't.  I know cause I just heard about it on The Daily Show.  Putting his face on the 10 dollar bill is still an issue.  I'll say right now there's going to be no reason to take sides. I just want to bring someone to your attention.  The man working to bring his face to the 10 dollar bill says his reasoning is because Hamilton has been honored for about 80 years now.  And he's the only one on money who isn't a president. Therefore, Reagan should be on the 10 instead of him. Well, I would like to bet a 100 bucks that that's not true.
