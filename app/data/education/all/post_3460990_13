I had a great first half of the weekend, spending it hanging out with one of my best friends here in NYC. We went out for Chipotle, as it is now our tradition to spend Fridays in the company of burritos and beer, and then continued on to my apartment. There, we spent the rest of the evening watching Mystic River. Saturday we got my fixed up my house and then watched Mona Lisa Smile and Bend it Like Beckham. Overall, it was a fun and productive time.  Today I woke up with a headache that is progressing rapidly into a migraine, despite 2 Excedrin and a nap snuggling with a kitty. Ugh.   My current roommate is using the day to move out, which, in her usual fashion, is taking place the most unnecessarily difficult way possible. Rather than just calling a car service and loading the car and taking one trip to the apartment of whatever other person she has duped into thinking her was a normal, responsible adult, she has recruited a friend, and together they are transporting her things  one duffel bag at a time  using the subway. This experience epitomizes my entire relationship with her. Nothing is ever easy, even when it could be.   Only one more week of work before I start the Fellows training. Look for my university assignment to be revealed soon!
