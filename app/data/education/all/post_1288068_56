I am tidying up the flat so that Emma won't think I am a slob. Obviously this is madness as she has known me for over a decade and knows full well the extent of my slobbiness. But I need something to do to stave off the crazy! I am so so excited, not JUST because Emma is coming, but because the boy is on holiday, and we are going to Scotland to have a surprise party with fireworks and cake! And after that I am going to my parents' to eat and drink and torment the cat and be told to shut up by my brother who, to be fair, calls it like he sees it as far as I'm concerned. Hooray!  It feels like a proper summer holiday now.  This post is rubbish but I don't care!  *expresses holiday joy through the medium of interpretative dance*
