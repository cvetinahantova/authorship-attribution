wow,  it is amazing how easy it is to spend money in thailand.  eveything is so  cheap that i justify every purchase by saying that it would be three times  as much in the states.  i've got to stop doing this.  i'm making baht so i  need to think in baht instead of dollars.  anyway...  everything is going  great here.  we moved into the new building yesterday.  it is very nice and  all the rooms have aircon so no more standing in front of thirty kids  sweating my ass off.  thank god.  i'm doing more computer research this afternoon.  hopefully i'll have a new  laptop by the end of the week.  well gotta run.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?
