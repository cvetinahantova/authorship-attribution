Umm, I'm leaving to the States this afternoon. My flight is tomorrow at 2pm. Kinda nervous, the pre-flight syndrome, when I worry about things such as: what if the plane crashes... eh.. x_x  Well.. I won't have unlimited internet access in China, last time I went back the phone bill was sky high because I was constently chatting and stuff... heh... Well, must go..  * Currently feels  very empty .
