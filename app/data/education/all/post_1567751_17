"Does God love us truly?"  "Sure thing", I said. "Mister God loves everything."  "Oh", she said. "Well, then, why does He let things get hurt and dead?" Her voice sounded as if she felt she had betrayed a sacred trust, but the question had been thought and it had to be spoken.  "I don't know", I replied. "There's a great thing about Mister God that we don't know about."  "Well then," she continued, "if we don't know many things about Mister God, how do we know He loves us? ... them pollywogs, I could love them till I bust, but they wouldn't know, would they? I'm million times bigger than they are and Mister God is million times bigger than me, so how do I know what Mister God does?"  ...   "Fynn, Mister God doesn't love us." She hesitated. "He doesn't really, you know, only people can love. I love Bossy, but Bossy don't love me. I love the pollywogs, but they don't love me. I love you, Fynn, and you love me, don't you?"  I tightened my arm about her.  "You love me because you are people. I love Mister God truly, but He doesn't love me."  ...  "No," she went on, "no, He don't love me, not like you do, it's different, it's million of times bigger...Fynn, you can love better than any people that ever was, and so can I, can't I? But Mister God is different. You see, Fynn, people can only love outside and can only kiss outside, but Mister God can love you right inside, and Mister God can kiss you right inside, so it's different. Mister God ain't like us; we are a little bit like Mister God, but not much yet...You see, Fynn, Mister God is different from us because He can finish things and we can't. I can't finish loving you because I shall be dead millions of years before I can finish, but Mister God can finish loving you, and so it's not the same kind of love, is it?"  ~ 'Mister God, this is Anna' by Fynn
