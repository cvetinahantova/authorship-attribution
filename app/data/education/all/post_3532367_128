Why does life always seem to be a case of 2 steps forward and 1 step back. I was really looking forward to chatting to Angela after so long, but it seemed as though all the frustration came to the surface. Is it because we haven't seen each other for over a week or is it the situation or both?  It seems we both have really strong feelings for each other, yet those same feelings seem to be creating an obstacle between us. Are we both scared? I certainly didn't intend to feel this way about someone so quickly, but I dont't want it to spoil anything either.
