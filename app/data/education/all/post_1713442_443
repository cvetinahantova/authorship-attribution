urlLink A New Framework for Teaching in the Cognitive Domain. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Michael Molenda.  It reviews the idea of the cognitive domain in teaching.  From the ERIC Digest:  For the past half century a central concern of instructional technologists has been not so much the production and use of instructional materials but rather the design of instructional systems-lessons, courses, and programs. This shift of emphasis occurred with the advent of the programmed instruction movement in the late 1950s when educators and instructional media specialists came to understand that the "magic" of teaching machines was not in the hardware but in the pedagogical design of the software. As media specialists morphed into instructional technologists and became immersed in programmed-instruction lesson design they found themselves in league with instructional theorists, grappling with the issue of how to structure a lesson for maximum learning impact.    At mid-twentieth century, the dominant framework for lesson design-the programmed instruction format-was derived from efforts to apply operant conditioning to human learning. Cognitive psychology soon offered an alternative view, represented by Robert Gagne's Events of Instruction, which became the dominant framework through the end of the twentieth century. More recent developments suggest that a new conceptual framework, offered by M. David Merrill, may provide an even more comprehensive synthesis of instructional research and theory than the previous ones.
