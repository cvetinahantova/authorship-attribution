You know the Type I'm Talking About  I'm in a shitty mood, mostly because of Matt Hartwig. For all of those not in the know, we hate him. We all hate him. We meaning the group, all meaning everyone except possibly Tonya and Henri, and him meaning Matt. You'd think after being  punched  and being told  "F*** off, nobody likes you!"  you'd get the slightest feeling that you're not the most popular person. It kind of worked. He stopped walkin home with us, but get this: he still hangs out with us every morning! And now, today, he walked home with us!!! I can not stand it. Anyway, after he turned around and started walking back towards the high school I waited until he wouldn't be able to hear me then I made my opinion about him increasingly vocal. Tonya said, "He's behind us..." to which I thought to myself, "Duh. If he were with us then I wouldn't be talking about him." It was only when I turned around that I realised he was  very  behind us. As in three metres. I thought he'd continued walking away, but obviously he'd turned back again and caught up with us. The worst part is I don't really feel bad about it, I was actually half in shock / half in hysteria when I saw him. And now... I just hope he'll go away.  Then to finish off the perfect day, I get this SMS from Lily's phone at 8:53:49 saying:  "I love you write back"  Now look, she's a good friend and all, but... that was the alst thing I ever expected (let alone wanted) to find on my phone. Then to top it off I ran out of credit when I was just in the middle of explaining a whole lot of stuff to her. So I had to get Matt Larner to SMS her and tell her that I'm out credit. Five minutes I got a reply saying it was her sister saying all that stuff. I don't know whether it's true or not, but either way I'm going to live like it never happened. That's one door I want to stay closed.
