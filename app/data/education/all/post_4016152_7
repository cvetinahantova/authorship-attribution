urlLink    Now here is the REAL taxi of New York. Please take note of the serene brownish green tint to the water. As I reflect on this picture, I feel my love for the city growing. Maybe the New Yorkers, with all of their pride, are correct and the city really DOES have everything that a person could ever need... no reason to ever even consider going anywhere else.  Well, unless, of course... you believe that there still exists a land where water is clear, or of a blueish green hue.  Honestly, if you believe that, you probably are one of the radicals that buys all that crap about us landing on the moon too.     Did I mention that my apartment building isnt even wired for cable yet... As in... no hookups, no connections running into the building... nothing.  New York is SOOO cutting edge.   urlLink
