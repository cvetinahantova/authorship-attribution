I was just informed of some unfortunate news.  A girl I used to go to school with was just in a serious car crash in the Miami area.  On a really strange note, she is the current Miss Florida and I used to help her with math in highschool.  I haven't seen her since my freshman year in college but I hope all is well.   The Count of Monte Cristo is a really good book.  I'm not a particularity avid reader but I find that I can't put the book down and I'm reading it out of control.  For some reason I really like revenge stories.  I don't know why, I don't feel the need to get any one back.  Either way it makes for a good read and I suggest it to all and you're more then welcome to borrow it when I'm done.   Today was peppero day which was good.  I got a lot of it but none of the kind I really like.  I like the real stuff not the cheap imitation crap.  Everyone seemed to have the single long big sticks of it and none of the packs of the real stuff.  Oh well.  It was  good day but last year was better b/c I'd taught my kids longer and I was the only foreign teacher.  I was thinking today about what an ingenious idea peppero day is.  Someone working for peppero was like "lets make our own day for peppero day!"  Man I bet he is mega rich now.  Have you guys seen the displays of peppero downtown in front of the department stores?  Enough said. I had to forcibly throw a kid out of class today.  He kept pushing the envelope and got the boot.  The good thing he seemed get the point after he was ousted, and so did the rest of the kids.  I was in a really good mood today but for some reason I had no patience with the kids that like to screw around.  Ok I'm meeting the roomy for some beers across the street.
