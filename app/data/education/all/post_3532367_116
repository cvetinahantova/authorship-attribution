This morning is mad. Sandra is working, so am I from lunch time. We have kids who were up all night chatting and laughing and now can't get up out of bed for dancing. Sandra is panicing about getting them and herself ready and everyone is copping out.  I have to get ready to take the girls and friends dancing at 10.00. I have to take Rob to his Nan's to be looked after, then get back in time to get ready for work. It looks like it could rain as well, which is going to make this afternoon fun!
