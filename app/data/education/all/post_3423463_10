yeah, my wife knew i was in a crappy mood yesterday. as did i. i guess we both have our ways of dealing with it. i wrote to try to relieve the stress, she went and got me a lucky bamboo to make me feel better. it was really sweet. and yes, i feel strange using the word "sweet" to describe anyone, even my wife. that's ok though, no one will ever read this.  anyway, the cats destroyed the bamboo before i could get it to my desk this morning. i don't know whether it's going to live now. two of the stalks are turning yellow, i think. i can't remember whether they were yellow before or not. the third one seems to be doing all right. it didn't get hammered, though. thing is, i didn't know lennon could get up on the bookcase i had these on, what with his broken legs and everything. apparently he can.  saw pieces of april last night. it was good. about what i expected, which is saying a lot considering i had high hopes for it. one of the few movies from the last little while that wasn't disappointing. stepford wives was good, too. other than that, i'm kind of just a little nostalgic for the good ole days of star trek and other movies that i can't remember but seem always to eclipse the ones i see now. maybe i should keep a list of movies i actually like. i wonder how many would be on it.
