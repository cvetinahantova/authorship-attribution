It is something that we know will come to us all, but when it happens  to someone we know or even 2 people in 2 days we suddenly have a  reality check.  Part of being a youth worker is helping young people deal with  bereavement whether it be family divorce or death, at those times it is  easy to be understanding and be the voice of reason, but when I am put  in the position of the one bereaving it becomes very different.  As a Christian death can feel harder to deal with as you have to face  the fact that maybe the person who died may not be entering the kingdom  of God, when young people ask this it is a very difficult question to  answer at such sensitive times.  I feel that i have probably said enough and now need to go and deal  with my own thoughts and emotions.
