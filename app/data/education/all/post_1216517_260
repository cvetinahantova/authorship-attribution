hello, all. i'm writing this from the cloudy stanwood washington. dmh and i drove up here monday, it was a flawless performance, 19 hours of bliss. i dropped dmh off at the mall with trevor and then made it up to stanhood by 130 am. it's strange to be here this time, but i'm excited to be heading east next week. i did some research on something i'd always wondered about and found this very interesting. the land in northern california around redding is considered by some to be the 51st state, jefferson state. it's fascinating really; they have a website. urlLink look!  i don't know if that link worked or not. basically these folks got screwed by salem and sacramento and are pissed. the stanwood camano fair is this weekend and the headlining act is starship, whose hit you might remember is "we built this city". i might be busy, however, and i'm not sure i'll make it. or if i do i'll be preoccupied with the livestock i'm sure. pigs are awesome. so is bisquits and gravy which three gas stations on our road trip were advertising specials on. can't think of anything that goes better with ten gallons of fuel, a pack of cigarettes and a dirty restroom. ciao.
