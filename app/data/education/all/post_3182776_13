Ahhhh. That's better.  The end of the week is here. Finished my first proper lesson an hour or so ago. I successfully taught twenty-six girls how to transform clay into mud pies. A roaring success, I think you'll agree.  Am now agonising between staying home and taking root on the sofa with sweets and rubbish TV for company, or dragging my sorry carcass to some faraway watering hole and abusing it with alcohol until I can no longer speak properly. Neither option sounding entirely convincing, I may go and drink shandy in the parking lot as a compromise.  I wonder what shiny delights the weekend holds?
