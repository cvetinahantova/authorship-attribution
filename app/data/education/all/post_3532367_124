Another couple of emails from Angela, the first saying she thinks she has lost me, the second saying she knows she is being demanding, but lets meet, talk and put the fun back into our lifes. This has made me happier this morning I must admit, but it is all very up and down at the moment. I am still sure it will work out in the end.
