................ ...shhhh.... ................  my office is completely quiet right now. (which never happens.)   i realize that i haven't had many minutes of completely quiet during this entire break.   two days in pajamas after new years with the fam -- were very sabbath-y, but not quiet.  Jaelyn got new braids today -- her stylist is named Whisper.  It was a tragic, tender-headed experience in the downtown mall, J.C.Penney salon.  The only moments of joy were when I invented a story in which Addison and I had ridden a runaway escalator up, up, up through the roof of the mall, past the clouds only to be rescued at the last possible minute by a recurring character in my stories -- Mortimer the seagull.  Mort also perches on the dock in front of the family cottage in while we eat dinner in the summertime, looking out over Mackinac Bay.   Outside I think that the (newly) freezing temperature has frozen the entire world in a grey cloudy, leave-less, snow-less funk.    On a whim on Saturday morning I made pomengranate sauce (remember my dream from over a month ago).  It turned out beautifully.  I'm a happy man.   My grandma Marge sent me a draft of her story -- Through the Register -- I'm living in the pools of my grandparents stories thinking about what they mean to me / about me.  Jodi breezed through town last night and we loved looking @ pictures of her trip to Egypt.   Watched SPIDER this weekend.  VERY provocative film.  I liked it a lot, but don't count that as a recommendation until we have a conversation about it...  ~peace.
