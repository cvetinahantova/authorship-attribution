Nightmare day on Friday. In the evening, before me and Si were about to go out, I had a shower. There was a surge of water pressure that scorched me, I leapt back, the shower span out of control and flooded the bathroom. It happened so quickly! I called Si and, as I did so, there was an urgent knocking on our front door. The water had gone through the floor and flooded downstair's ceiling and light fittings. Naturally our neighbour was very angry, although his wife was more understanding. He thought we'd done it on purpose. Naturally we offered to pay for the damage and he calmed down, but he still gave Si a hard time. I was devestated. Saturday morning I went down to speak to them and he'd calmed down a lot. He apologised to Si for being so angry, appreciated that it was nobody's fault and, as he's a builder, he's repairing the damage himself.  So thankfully no harm done. Last night me and Si managed to go out and we saw Spiderman 2. It was actually a great film; I really enjoyed it more than I was expecting to. We also had a lovely meal at our local restaurant, which was excellent as usual. I've decided to apply for some jobs at the local council.  It seems naive not to try and get a job as nothing in London is forthcoming as yet. Neither of us would be unhappy to stay in Plymouth for a little bit longer - it would give me a chance to rest and also we could save more money. So I'm going to apply tomorrow and hope for the best. It would certainly give me valuable admin experience.
