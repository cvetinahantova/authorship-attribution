okay, This week has been very entertaining! Yeah, First off, My personal project is pissing me off! I don't have any of my materials and the photo teacher hasn't told me how to work the medium format camera! thats only because he's always busy! I dont know what I am going to do. I have nothing left to do. I am stuck and that just drives me insane.   Oh well, Other then that my week has been awsome. I know now that I am really in love with him and nothing can change that. Nothing I mean absolutely nothing! But yeah! Things have gotten a little crazy lately. i hope that I am not grounded for too long this time! But I only have 6 min left of class.   Yeah, I'm going to miss my freinds while im grounded! And hopefully they are going to miss me too!  Love-ed you all so much you have no Idea......... But yeah robyn hopefully we can get together to go to the clinic and yeah..... not going to say much else about that...... Love-ed you all again, Love-ed, TwEaK  oh did i mention what I was grounded for? I argued with my parents last night on whether gay was wrong or not and apperantly they dissagreed with me!
