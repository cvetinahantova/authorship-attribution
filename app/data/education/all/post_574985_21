After  urlLink Tim Bednar  went to all the trouble of signing up for a Blogger account just so he could post a comment here, I figured I'd better look into a different approach for the comments system. Actually, Blogger allows users to change the comments settings to allow any old reader to speak their piece. So, it's fixed now. Comment away. (Sorry you had to go through the hassle, Tim.)
