Jovana got arrested. Her mother called the cops on her and now she is in a detention center in Rochester.   Now I'm going off to track, run my cares away, come home and shower, watch the Olympic Track Trials from last night, and sleep. What a life I live.  Not much else going on, really. I have absolutely nothing going on for a while. I know it is really weird, but I can't wait for school. The feeling of needing to be somewhere and the feeling of being on a track team and the feeling of independance and being out of the house just makes me feel better. I could do without the work, but being busy and having things to do and being needed on a team...I miss those things. School is a great idea in theory, but the practical application of it is just silly.
