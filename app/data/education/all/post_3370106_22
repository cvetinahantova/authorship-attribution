Tapping into the everlasting source of inspiration, renewal, and healing, receiving the gifts of our very essence; why have I waited so long to turn my gaze toward the light?  Still, I look away, look to the world of material gratification, lust turning to pure thanks for all life's diversity, curves and scents.  Mostly I look longer, linger where I should not, ask myself why, try to accept my feelings and the energy of my sexuality.  I take it upon myself to learn to respectfully and inwardly work through the many encounters that grasp at desire for more than the reality...there is nothing but god, there is joy in respect and service to others is the key to happiness.  My energy will forever be infused with the desire to incorporate work, worship, play with the most fulfilling presence of mind, that state of mind centered in the third eye, giving ever more awareness, awakeness, and effort towards all my actions, continuing to open myself to alignment and expansion throughout the sacred spine's chakra.
