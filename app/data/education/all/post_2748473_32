I'd never lie to you  Unless I had to  I'll do what I got to  Unless I had to  I'll do what I got to, the truth  is you could slit my throat  And with my one last gasping breath  I'd apologize for bleedin on your shirt   And all I (all I)  Need to know (need to know)  Is that I'm somethin you'll be missin  (is that I'm somethin that you're missin)  (maybe I should hate for this)  Maybe I should hate you for this  Never really did ever quite get that far  (maybe I should hate for this)  Maybe I should hate you for this  Never really did ever quite get that...   Cause I'm a wishful thinker with the worst intentions  This'll be last chance you get to drop my name  Cause I'm a wishful thinker with the worst intentions  This'll be last chance you get to drop my name   If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar     Drowning in my inadequacies today, and allergies are bad. if you have ever lost a dear friend and have them totally shut you out of their life it makes you feel like you murdered them.
