I've tried to be creative with my passwords, since it seems like I have a zillion of them.  I have a special secret notebook just for accounts, logins and passwords.  But I forgot one important fact:  I'm a lousy typist.  I had changed my blog passwords to "LestatBites!", thinking that it would be easy to remember but hard to crack.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to type that sequence of characters unless I can see the words.  After being unable to log into my own account, I had to re-think and change it again.    I've come up with a great way to randomly select a password.  Open a blank word processing file, and just type several comfortable letters with each hand.  Don't look at the screen until you are done.  Next, look at your selections, and see if you can rapidly type the same thing over again without looking at the keyboard.  Bingo - new password.  Unless you are a REALLY cruddy typist and your password is fffjjj.
