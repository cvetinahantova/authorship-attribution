Great book! 

 Okay, I must admit that the guy does not provided me with enough substantiation, enough physical proof, full original documents.  On the other hand, I do understand that that can be anywhere from dangerous to illegal.  Nevertheless, not everthing is within the scope of believable without physical evidence.  Now, I must say that the only reason I did not put the book down and called it bull, is that Palast is a former UofCer; and I could tell from the moment I began reading, before I even knew he is one of us.  That having been said, I'll trust he has not forgotten that no claim is to be made unsubstantiate, and all claims must be justified.
