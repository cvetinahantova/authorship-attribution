- feeling sentimental -  it hasn't been a great week.  you can probably guess when someone's back burner all but goes out that their arse is getting roasted by the front burner...  But right now I'm trying (on my front burner) to wade through my inbox full of emails...  And I'm struck by how lucky i am to know the people I do -- to have passed through the lives of so many of you, to be tangled in the nets and webs and fabrics of your lives even still...  It seems like too many people that I love (more than unusal) feel keenly the struggle of life right now.    Feel discouraged, feel disappointed, feel confused.   And I have to say that I, too, have felt a little of that recently...(is it the approach of Mars?)  But on the other hand, I do feel buoyed by the love.  The occasional, gentle, brief, quick --  *brushes*  *nudges*   *touches*  by you.  IN THE FORM OF: the quick emails.  the phone calls. the brief conversations.  the teasing.  the good joke in a website. the compliment. the shared beer or shared eucharist.  You know that moment in _A Room With a View_ where Julian Sands character runs into the field and embraces the world...just before he shares that scandalous and amazing kiss with Helena Bonham Carter's character (see * for sidenote below) ? -- that's how I feel right now -- even though my front burner sucks.  and the world does seem too much to bear.  It also feels like there's too much beauty in the world...   Is there a way that I can fwd. some of you some of my HOPE -- because I'm convinced that that's what it is...the reality that YOU exist in my world...gives me hope...  and...(of course)  peace~      *Lynn and I haven't forgiven Helena BC, the little hussy, for breaking up the greatest Shakespearean-cum-Hollywood couple ever -- Branaugh and Thompson....
