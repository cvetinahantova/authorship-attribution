i have decided to write only when i have stuff to write. no point forcing myself to do things 'coz it's routine. i went to  parkway  again and saw  shayne , but she didn't see me. so i was sick that time and i felt bad. and i bought a smoothie from  new zealand all natural , to make matters worse. yesterday was a trip to  bugis . it was packed. went to  edge  and bought a wire keychain for a few bucks. it really wasnt worth it, later i thought. was late for piano later on. i guess i will never go shopping with them anymore. mum's the word. she's hopping mad and i guess she wont let me stay home anymore. i get eaten up by the com. no song for today. my song of remorse is all i can offer. pray for me. tell Him to reveal Himself in me and all of you.  need to get some work done now. see u agn when i have the time.
