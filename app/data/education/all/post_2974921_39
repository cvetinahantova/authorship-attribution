i can't believe this! my uncle and i spent more than 2 hours together, just by ourselves yesterdy, and he still hasn't allowed me to talk to jammi. i bet he never will.....  i asked jammi to call yesterday and i was all hurrying and excited and nervous at the same time. but unfortunately, my uncle asked me to come with him to buy some fishes and i missed jammi's call!  i'm so pissed off i woke up at 1 in the afternoon today. damn that aircon!
