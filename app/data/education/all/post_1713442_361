urlLink State Proficiency Testing in Mathematics. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Jeremy Kilpatrick.  It looks at the issue of state testing of math proficiency.  From the ERIC Digest:  In recent years many states have developed their own assessments of student learning in mathematics, usually aligned with state standards or curriculum frameworks. Many of these assessments are intended to have high stakes: financial or other consequences for districts, schools, teachers, or individual students. In some cases, teacher promotions or high school diplomas may depend on students achieving passing scores. As of 1998, 48 states and the District of Columbia had instituted testing programs, typically at grades 4, 8, and 11 (Council of Chief State School Officers, 1998).    Many states report the results of high-stakes assessments by school or by district to identify places most in need of improvement. State responses to assessment results vary. Some states have the authority to close, take over, or "reconstitute" a failing school, but to date only a few states have ever used such sanctions (Jerald, Curran, & Boser, 1999). Florida awards additional funds to schools that perform near the bottom or near the top of the range (Sandham, 1999). When schools or districts with poor results do not show sufficiently rapid improvement, some states revoke accreditations, close the schools, seize control of the schools, or grant vouchers that enable students to enroll elsewhere.
