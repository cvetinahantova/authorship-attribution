Be Careful What You Know   I received the following email this morning from my friend Anna:   Hey Pete, I'm wrapping up to hand in the novella next week, and wanted to quiz  you on a little D and D trivia.  I'm looking to figure out what a bad guy might  be called -- specifically a guy who looks to take over territory or kingdoms  or whatever it is you do in that game?  Does this make sense?  NOt a specific  name, just the role: are they called kings/tyrants/assholes???  any help would be greatly appreciated.     What is more notable here: 1)  That a  girl     is asking me about Dungeons and Dragons (If this had happened twelve years ago, when I was actually playing the game, I'd be in love.) Or 2) That a girl is asking  me    about Dungeons and Dragons.  (What am I, some resource on all things dorky?  I'm a little concerned that she knows, implicitly, that I am the guy to ask this sort of question.)
