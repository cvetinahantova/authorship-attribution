ZEYNEP TUFEKCI, z99@mail.utexas.edu, http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A43496-2004Jan23&notFound=true Tufekci, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas, has studied job-training programs. She said today: "The White House is already trying to backpedal from the annual Economic Report of the President which predicted 2.6 million jobs added for this year. We know that it will add far less; moreover, many of the new jobs will not be paying a living wage. Developments in technology and corporate globalization have greatly reduced the leverage of workers everywhere to obtain decent wages and working conditions -- until that changes, we are likely to continue to see divergent results: productivity is up but wages are lagging, profits are up but jobs are lackluster, stock market is up, so is the number of people without health insurance. Locally adjusted global minimum wage and universal corporate codes of conduct could be a first step."
