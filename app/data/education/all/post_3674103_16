ok. it's time to warn everyone about the killer umbrellas of south korea. this is no joke, and i'm dead serious. the following is very important for anyone who is considering coming here.  when it rains in korea (which it does often, especially in monsoon season), everyone and their mother has an umbrella. this in and of itself wouldn't be a huge problem. however, when you take into consideration the narrowness of the streets and sidewalks, as well as the behaviour of the average korean person (that is, personal space does not exist here), the outcome is the killer umbrella. i've been jabbed and poked. i've had to jump and dart out of the way. it's really only a matter of time until i get one in the eye and go blind. i've learned to fend off blows with my umbrella as well as see escape routes before a horrible umbrella stabbing can occur.  the worst part is yet to come. one might think that this situation can't be all that bad. i mean, how often can it really rain. it is usually sunny in korea, right? well, that is right. it is usually sunny and hot here. however, that is when the dreaded sun umbrellas show their ugly face. i swear to god if anyone i know buys a sun umbrella, i'll have to kill them on the spot. at least when it's raining i have my own umbrella to use for protection. when it's sunny out, i'm all vulnerable and open to the jagged umbrella tip.  another funny aspect of the sun umbrella is the accompanying "darth vader mask" which my fellow co-workers have labeled it as. this mask is part visor and part nuclear helmet. the brims tend to be huge and cover the entire face of the person wearing it. i personally have no idea why someone wearing one of these abomidable hats would ever need a sun umbrella, but i guess i'm just an outsider when it comes to south korean culture.
