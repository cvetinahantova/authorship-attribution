hello,  well i found a bootleg copy of farenheit 9/11 on the street yesterday.  even  though i don't like micheal moore i thought he did a good job on the  documentary.  definately one sided but not as over the top as he usually is.    anyway... i know some of you have seen the movie.  what did you think?  oh  yeah i only paid $3 for the dvd btw.  ha!  all you silly americans paying $6  dollars to see it in a theatre! jk.  well anyway....   i went to a street vendor yesterday that i used to go to  all the time, but have not visited recently.  i realized while sitting there  that i could see convent rd. (where st. joe is) and my gym from my table.   it was very surreal to realize that when i first got here and was walking  around not knowing where to eat or what to do or even at times where i was  that i ended up at a place that would become so familiar.  now the vendors  all recognize me and are attempting to teach me words in thai.  i'm a  terrible student!  well i've gotta run.  there is a teacher's meeting today in sister erlinda's  office.  yuck.  no jk she's been so busy lately she hasn't had time to  harass the farangs.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Overwhelmed by debt?
