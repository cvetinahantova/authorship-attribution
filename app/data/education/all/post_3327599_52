silly me i had no idea where that was from.. i'm soooo sorry Phildo.. i mean Just Phil..  So yeah i went back to work today but i only had one kid so it was ok/boring. we went and hung out at the mall and it was cool to see the looks i got from guys until they saw the 5yr old tugging on my hand HAHA. stupid boys. anyway after that i dragged Phil and Sadie to southern ag. silly unsuspecting furry friends.. i didn't know what to say.. Sadie got stabbed in the butt and Phil had to carry my goat feed hehe. anyway so i went home and no one even asked where i was going tonight.. didn't even act liked they cared.. so i left.. hung out with Sheila for awhile at walgreens and then i went to Phil's and then went to a pool hall. and then i came home!   i know how all of you think i talk just to hear my own voice but damn it i'm not alone!! and it's nice to know i'm not the only one who babbles incoherently all the time.. Adam (this guy i met) does it too! and let me just say boys.. changin' that tire turned me on.. and then y'all feelin' each other up at the pool hall.. damn i woulda done all three of you on the table.. jk! haha i'm tired..   (sissy i didn't drink! scouts honor)
