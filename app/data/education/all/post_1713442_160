urlLink Weather Underground: Welcome to The Weather Underground  We got eight inches of snow today in Mount Pleasant, Michigan.  It had not been forcasted.  Through the day, weather reports repeatedly said we were going to get 3-6 inches.  WRONG. It just kept snowing.  My oldest son got sent home early from school.    I found the most acurate weather prediction at the Weather Underground site.  I know this is an old site and most people know about it.  Still, I found it really helpful today and thought I would return the favor by giving it a link here.
