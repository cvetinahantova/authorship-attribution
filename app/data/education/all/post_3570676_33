I must admit that when I saw the directions from the instructor regarding a "blog," I began scratching my head and wondering what the heck she was talking about. I may be a bit behind in this technology-savy world, but I had never heard of it before. After reading further, I discovered that it is very much like a public discussion board or forum...maybe even identical with a unique, eye-catching name for it. I think it's a great idea for people who have similar interests or have some other kind of common bond. I too think it could be a good tool for a class, but it needs to be relevant and useful...not something to use just to say you use it. Teachers must consider the types of, the ages of, and the academic level of students, among other things, before incorporating this resourse, if they want to use it effectively. OK...so I've voiced my opinion and made my post! Now, I'm moving on to something else.  Chad
