Unconditional    for all the talk of love that I have been witness to it pales to what I have experienced here with you  I have been taught to be  less than zero my walls and masks  too numerous to name  so many years of not knowing myself I want to smash this lie this pattern of running from those who see me and love me or worse yet hurting them  for seeing past my defenses I nearly died inside  for those lost chances  but on this day my arsenal is laughed at ridiculed and yet I am loved not in words this time that I cannot feel but in actions  you come after me and do not run from me I am a stranger to this new type of love... unconditional  I hold onto it with all of my heart afraid of it and yet afraid to let it go  Â©2003 DC Vision
