i'd just like to know, when is the exact time that talking to complete strangers became okay. when i was walking down the street in canada, people would not do that. when i was at the airport leaving to come to korea, i didn't see many people striking up conversations with the first person that walks by. on the plane here, no one spoke to me (other than the flight attendants and possibly the captain if that announcement counts). i got off the plane and set foot in korea, and suddenly every westerner on the street is my best friend.  i would, at one time, have thought this would be a good thing. i mean, everyone being nice and saying hello. now that it's a reality, i wish people would just shut up and leave me alone. i guess i'm somewhat flattered when a westerner turns around and follows me down the street just to ask me which school i work at. however, i feel a little more scared and afraid of this lonely, creepy person who's extremely desperate to speak to anyone who can understand him. i personally didn't come to korea expecting a busy social life, or one at all for that matter (it's obviously called the hermit nation for a reason).  to be honest, i thought i'd come here and meet some people that would be slightly similar to myself, and have the same reasons for being here. however, the vast majority of people i have met are purely insane (my opinion of course, not a clinical diagnosis). i'll save the breakdown of the people i meet here for a later posting.
