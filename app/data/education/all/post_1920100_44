Hola!  Well  today  was the start of a hectick week after the long weekend. This past weekend was great. I was able to spend a lot of time with people who love God and with my family. Also, I have been very fortunate because the class I am teaching is really good. It is good for me because I have more time to focus on all the stuff I have to do instead of disciplining all the time.  God  has really been working in my heart lately. I don't seek to understand but I pray for a heart of obedience and for me to be stronger in my faith. At home it has been tuff. My mom is babysitting 6 of my nieces and nephews and the house and the stress has been chaotic. I am trying to be patient and loving.   Today I started working out . I really have let that go for a while and I am determined to do it for myself and get back in shape. I have really been feeling down regarding this, but I also realize it is my fault. I hope everything goes well. Today I didn't find anyone to go with me to the park so I decided to work out at home. I have this 3mile video that is 47 minutes long. It was a great workout! I plan to continue with this and doing my step aerobics. I am still praying about joining a gym or finding someone to workout with. It's much more encouraging to have someone support you along the way.   I also had some time  to learn more about God (read the word) and pray. That is always a blessing.   I have a problem though . I am suppose to report tomorrow to jury duty but I can't I have work. I tried callling like an hour ago but it was closed. I was hoping they had an automated system but they don't. Since, I have already postponed it once I have to speak to an actual person during business hours. I pray everything goes well tomorrow when I call. Has anyone been in this situation? What is going to happen if I can't go?
