My first bento!  I stayed up last night and made it.  Bento means boxed lunch and there are many different shaped boxes made of plastic or wood.  My bento has a tomato, omelet, cucumber and onigiri.  I already ate one onigiri before this picture. The best part about lunch here, is that everyone takes a nap afterward. You just get a short futon and pillow and blanket out of the closet and spread out on the floor for 30min to an hour.  I`m still sleepy though.Â  urlLink     urlLink
