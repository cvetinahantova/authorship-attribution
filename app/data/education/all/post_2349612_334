man... what a 2 days...   wednesday night (1) it pouring down rain at precisely the moment i started to load my car, (2) my brother having time for the first night all week for a sonic slush run and joyriding for a bit, and (3) several interesting IM conversations i got myself into late at night, i didn't go to sleep until 1am... then in an effort to get on the road early enough to get to pittsburgh before my younger cousins' usual 9:30 bedtime, i woke up at 4:30, and drove 14 hours on 3.5 hours of sleep... yes, it took me 14 freakin hours to make the trip... (usually it takes 12.5) because on I-71 between lousiville, KY and cincinnati, OH they had everyone merge into one lane and then stopped all traffic for a bit so a gravel truck could go back and forth across the road to fill in the shoulder with said gravel... sitting in park on the interstate for an hour when you're ready to fall asleep already and have at least 6 hours of driving to go yet... yeah, i was not so happy.   on the other hand, besides that, and seeing one of the worst wrecks ever between harrisburg and allentown, PA today (a suburban with a mobile home on the back had tumbled over several times, and both parts were on their sides/upside down with several other cars off the road as a result of the fray), it was a good trip... beautiful weather the whole way through... about 10 minutes of rain total, and a certain friend of mine just calls every so often now to see how life is going and make me laugh :-)   so indeed... that's the scoop... 1 day to let my energy level recuperate, and then i'm off and running again!   more tales to come, i'm sure :-P   later dudes :-)
