This is truly beyond my capacity for satire. First a guy into threesomes (note: I wish we had a legal system that would prevent me from knowing this). Now a man best known for losing miserably in a Senate race in Maryland and stage diving during his preposterous run for the Republican presidential nomination. That said, I would certainly skip watching The Simple Life to see an Obama-Keyes debate...
