I’m so afraid of losing memories. Memories of carefree, intense, passionate youth. It’s happening – old memories replaced by newer ones. Heaviness of life covering over the hopefulness. Reality sinking dreams of the awestruck heart. And I want to grab on, railing against the loss. I want to live again through these memories. And all I can do is want, because time doesn’t wait.  Running the tunnels of my mind seems to be a constant past-time. Images pop into view, a bit hazy like old photos. I touch them gingerly and move on, hoping I’ll be able to find my way back somehow.   A Wendy Moment–    I had done something terrible to someone I loved madly. So deep was the hurt in both of us – he crept away and I was left with dramatic physical and emotional effects of what I’d done. My shoulders and neck burned with tension. My throat was so constricted that I was unable to swallow food. I woke up repeatedly in the night, choking for breath, my heart beating irregularly. My eyes, darkened by grief and lack of sleep, were heavy and dull. There was no one I trusted to share this burden with – until Wendy.   I was sitting on the lower-level steps of the university’s student union, waiting by the series of glass doors leading to the bus stop. Wendy slipped up behind me and sat down. I don’t remember her saying anything. She just looked at me. Perhaps she touched my arm, and I saw assurance and acceptance in her eyes. I asked, “Can you keep a secret?” She nodded. (And probably made some smart-ass remark! But, I value sarcasm, so I was sold.)   And out it spilled. No tears that I remember. Just a deep sense of relief; no more going it alone. I don’t recall what words of wisdom she shared – though I’m sure she did because Wendy generally likes to tell people what to do, especially me. ;-)   I knew at that moment that we would be holding-fast, loving-boldly friends forever. She is still the tender keeper of my secrets.
