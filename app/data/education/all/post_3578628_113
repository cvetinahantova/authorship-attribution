I have to admit, I've made some mistakes.  I shouldn't have insulted your family when you couldn't go to Spider Man 2.  I shouldn't expect you to know in less than a half hour if you can go somewhere.  And I shouldn't lead you on.  There are some things that you need to know the truth about.  The way I handle religion, is something you should know otherwise, you're going to wrestle with it.  My thoughts on G.W. lol well, I will lay those out too.  Michael Moore... I know you don't agree with what he does.  I will tell you about movie planning.  I'm not going to hold back anything.  This is what I think and knowing what I truly feel will allow you to handle me better.  I just ask this and this is for everybody:  Just because I don't agree with it...doesn't mean you can't talk about it in front of me.  I still haven't forgotten the time when Barbie and Preston were hooking up.  I still kind of had a thing for Barbie and you all knew it.  You kept it from me cause nobody wants to hurt cute little Kevin.  Well, I want to be a man about things now.  Let's not be foolish.  We're all friends and we don't need to hide things like that.  You're all great.  Can't say that enough...Keep enjoying the summer!
