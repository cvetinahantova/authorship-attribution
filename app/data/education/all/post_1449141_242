urlLink TOMPAINE.com - Under The Radar  Under The Radar    Jim Hightower is a former Texas Agriculture Commissioner and author of If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates.     This is the first of three excerpts we are publishing this month from Jim Hightower's forthcoming book, Thieves In High Places.    There are three things you never want to see:  Water coming out of your electrical sockets.  Flames shooting out of your sock drawer.  A press release coming out of the White House that begins: "The Bush administration today announced revised standards for..."  It doesn�t matter �for what.� When you see that eight-word lead you just know it�s going to be yet another piece of awful news, yet another revision of the rules that�ll let yet another industry or specific corporation have a free hand to clobber us regular folks. From inaugural day forward, the Bush White House has spewed out a torrent of �revised standards,� altering the rules to allow the Powers That Be more leeway to pollute our air and water, restrict our access to health care, invade our privacy, take away our rights on the job, raid our pensions, muffle our freedom of speech, privatize our public resources ... you name it.       The Bush agenda is to disunite America.
