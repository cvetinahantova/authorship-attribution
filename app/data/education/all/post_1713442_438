urlLink Trends in School Leadership. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Larry Lashway.  It reviews the recent literature on school leadership.  From the ERIC Digest:  Within the last five years, policy-makers and practitioners have confronted the challenge of replacing many retiring educational leaders. Districts have fewer qualified applicants to fill positions requiring an increasingly sophisticated set of skills to deal with everything from school safety to standards-driven accountability.    The recent passage of the No Child Left Behind Act has turned up the heat even more by putting the full weight of federal policy behind the accountability movement, mandating that schools bring all children-including racial minorities, English-language learners, and students with disabilities-to an adequate level of progress.    In response, policymakers, researchers, and school leaders themselves have scrutinized the job, asking what skills are most essential and formulating recommendations for reshaping the profession. While consensus remains elusive, several persistent themes have emerged.
