My hands numbed the whole of yesterday thats y neber blog. Went SengHow's place for a mahjong game and lost almost 50 bucks....damnz!! Must be becos my hands were numbed...tats y cannot chut power!! Anyway Today went for interview at another Outdoor Adventure company. Since i doing freelance now, will starve if i stick to 1 company....might as well look for more companys=more assignments. Got 1 assignment liao . Though the pay is rather low for the first assignment, it will subsequently increase as they pay according to seniority and experience. One of the highest paying company if i gain enough experience. Thru the interview, the interviewer was kind enough to teach me some interview techniques that might help me in the future.  Met up with Melissa and Huijun for dinner at TM mac. Didnt eat much though. Oni ate 1 MacChicken. Now i am feeling freaking hungry.  Had a long icq chat with Joey and we went through all sorts of topics ranging from the LAMEST cum CORNIEST lecturer in NUS politcal science dept that taught us in yr 1 to Project Sangkhim to "Fishing" ( me the fisherman , she the fish...hahaha). I can talk to her on anything....studies, corny jokes, politics....anything and everything...guessed thats wat u call Click. or both of us are friendly beings.  When she asked me what made me join project sangkhim, i recapped the series of events that happened right from the first email i received about an ongoing recruitment talk to the completion of the project. Concluded that it is fate or some like to say it is the CALLING. It just happened.   Time to hunt in my kitchen liao ...adios. Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
