Catch the water!Â  urlLink     urlLink     Well, Abbie eventually woke up...after sleeping for  3 and 1/2 hours!   That kind of thing doesn't happen very often.  When she is on her schedule, she usually sleeps for EXACTLY 2 hours then gets up, thanks to DayCare.  But, when she is not on schedule, she usually doesn't take a nap...bummah.  Well, it was already 5 when she got up, and I needed to find something that would make her tired enough to go to bed at 8:30, (Yeah, right...but we'll see.) so, obviously, we went outside and washed my car.  It has needed a bath for a few days, because I parked in our new driveway under the Mexican Elder tree...yeah...not a good idea at all.  I walked out in the morning, and my car was  covered  with  purple berries .  ARGH!  So, I sprayed it off, but haven't had time to wash it until now, and I think there are still some berries left on there, even though I put TONS of elbow grease into it.  Sux!  So, I'll keep you posted on how tonight goes, because I am *supposed* to get in bed at 9 to go to work in the morning.  We'll see.
