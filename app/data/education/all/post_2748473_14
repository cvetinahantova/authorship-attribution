I finally found some classic Beloved stuff! yay!  NEW WINE  In the moment captured by sweet tasting blood My cup overflows, send us your love (full of your love) As my thirst grows, I find it hard To trust all those, so send us your love (send us your love)  Your face is all I see It brings me to my knees And I lift my hands up to the sky Restore us, o God, upon us, let your light shine  Although I know youâ€™re close, I feel so far away This pictures not the same without you here (send us your love) With my arms outstretched, this emptiness will embrace the light So embrace this heart, (send us your love) never again will it be dark  Your face is all I see It brings me to my knees And I lift my hands up to the sky Restore us, o God, upon us, let your light shine  (New wine) all I see (New wine) takes a part of me (New wine) and I lift my hands up to the sky (New wine) restore us o God, upon us, let your light shine  Lord, (new wine), I see The truth is (new wine) in front of me I lift my hands up to the (new wine) sky Restore us o God, upon us (new wine) let your light shine  So break this heart Break me So break this heart Break me   School, work, homework........chilling. love you all lots.
