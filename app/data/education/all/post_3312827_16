Today I made about $50 at work.  Not bad... I guess people were in the mood to give me good tips!  One woman came in just to buy a pint of Absolut and tipped me $2 for ringing her up!  Delores said she always does that for the waitresses, but she doesn't do it for her (because she's the owner).  Delores tended bar today and didn't make me tip her, either.  Tomorrow we have a party of about 10-12 coming in from WalMart.  Hopefully they'll tip me above the 18% gratuity I'm going to tack onto their check.  I'll just have to smile a lot and be extra nice.  I think tomorrow I'm going to bring my vacuum into work.  I hate dealing with that other vacuum cleaner... it's so heavy and it's a beast.  If I have my trusty Oreck, I can vacuum and get ready for the restaurant to open in no time!  Read a lot of crazy nonsense about Scientology today... what a wacky cult!  Ooops... they'll probably blacklist me now.  Oh well.  ;)   Gotta go to bed, it's getting late.  And again, I'm not tired.
