We hid ourselves.     That gentle voice that times before had welcomed us,     Now sought us out.   We trembled.     In the cool of the day as we crouched motionless     Listening to our racing pulse,         Our stifled breath,         His approaching steps.   He called.     Not for knowledge sake, but for ours.             For mine. Shall His peircing eyes now bring me to my knees,     Or to my own defense?
