Well okay, I am in science now! They are all outside, to see a group project preveiw of what they're doing......... I asked for the option to stay inside and work. So that is what I am going to do. I am working on my emulsion, I have yet to mix t but once I do I am going to experiment with printing on glass. So that should be awsome. Mr.Chambers has 4 boxes of glass cut into rectangle sections that I can print on. He said that they were going to be thrown away, but that I could use them that way we wouldn't waste all of that glass he got. So yeah this is very cool. I am happy that I am making progress on my project. I am not happy that I am falling behind once again in int. lit. I hate that I can't keep up. I am not where I should be in the book we are reading. I haven't done my vocab for a while and thats two points everyday. So yeah I am not surprised that I have a low grade in that class. I am not suprised that I might fail this class and have to take it next year. I don't want to but I might have to if I don't get my act together like everyone is telling me I should do. But I am also thinking of summer school and earning the credits that I didn't get or need to catch up on. But other then that everything is fine. I guess.......... Last night my mom got mad at me, cuz I was using her crafty stuff and was leaving stuff all messy. But later she comes into my room doesn't say a word. She goes over to my desk and dumps the top drawer onto the floor. On the pile of newly cleaned clothes. I was so pissed. I stayed up till 1:30 am being pissed at her. But as she left my room she said, " I was just reorganizing your stuff. I thought you would like it." But when she left I said to myself. "i'll reorganize your face." I was so mad.........
