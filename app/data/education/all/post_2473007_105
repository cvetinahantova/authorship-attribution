I have not cried in months.   What I cannot understand about us is that we see childhood as a pitiful moment that will dry up and blow away not a moment too soon.  When heaven is so full of innocence, our children are yearning, reaching, scheming for an adulthood wracked with guilt and pain.  To a child, every tree, every house, every taste, every smell is new and wonderful and even fear itself is a stranger, calmly met with inquisitive minds.  Untouched (unspoiled) attitudes embrace every stage and every script with gusto, as if it were both their first and last.   Yet each child, each smiling face, will fight the good fight of faith and will one day stop, look back and realize that they have not cried in months.
