So the city I'm in is or was called "little Paris."  I can see why, as they do have a replica of the Eiffel tower near the post office.  And it definatly has a very French influence to it.  The city itself is great and I've had an awesome time here.  Today I hooked it up on a tour and managed to get around and see all the major sights.  The climate of the city is rather odd as it's really cool.  I had to break out the long pants and jacket.  It's a welcome change though.  There was the scare of rain this morning but it cleared up and all was well.  So I saw the summer palace of the king.  To be honest it really wasn't a "palace" so to speak.  More like a big house.  A big ugly house at that.  But it was explain that it was built in 1933 when Vietnam was really poor so it was pretty impressive then.  I also something called the crazy house.  And yes it was truely crazy.  I wish I could describe it but I can't.  It was the oddest building I think I've ever seen in my life.  If I had to associate with something it would be a big dead tree or something like that.  We also went around and saw lakes, waterfalls and valleys.  After the tour there was even enough time for me to zip over to the local museum.  Get this I even got my own private guided tour.  I don't think many people make it to the museum.  Only nerds like me.  It's a shame b/c it as quite interesting.   Tomorrow I'm off to the beach again.  I'll be going to the city of Nha Trang.  This should be fun.  I have to get up early but the bus ride is only about 4 hours.  Ok I think I'm going to track down some more food and maybe hit a cafe or something and chill.  Where does the time go?
