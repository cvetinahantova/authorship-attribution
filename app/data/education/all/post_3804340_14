I reached home and had an exploding headache. What even worse was that my uncle and aunt whom I met for twice in my life came for the third visit.   A formula is the best illustration of my situation:    Karina = Full set of work clothes + warm and welcoming fair lady-like smile + appropriate topics + exploding head + tired + sleepy     My uncle and aunt are holy christians. Actually they are missionaries. So you know what the topics will be. Thanks for the training I received in secondary school. I managed to entertain them before I swore 'When will you two get the hell out of here?'  King uncle and Queen aunt were more than happy with the visit and thus granted us a box of pineapple cake.
