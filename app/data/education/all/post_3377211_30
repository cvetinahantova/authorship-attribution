urlLink    Here's a little tidbit that I'd like to share with you about my little brother.  He's the coolest kid in the universe.  I was browsing through my picture inventory tonight and came across this little gem from our last trip to Florida. In this shot, I was trying to get him to pose for a picture, and with my family consisting of a high level of dorkiness, we either make stupid faces or we just leave.  In this case, it's easy to see that my brother chose the latter option, and this is the only shot that I was able to get of him that night as he ran through the house.  He's 10 right now, almost 11, and I often stop to think about how in another year or two, he's going to not want to hang out with his big brother anymore.  Then again, I don't think I was much of a good brother to begin with, but I'm sure that some of you can understand how it's easy to idolize your big brother and/or sister even when they aren't perfect.  I just hope that I've done a good enough job with him in order to have a good relationship with him during what will most likely be the worst years of his life.  I hated adolescence more than any other time in my life.  Â  urlLink
