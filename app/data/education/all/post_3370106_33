If you know that song by Public Enemy it starts something like, "picture us cooling out on the 4th of july and if you heard we were celebrating it's a worldwide lie!"  But I know now that there is cause for celebration.  Freedom is worth celebrating, freedom is worth attaining and I will celebrate today and everday because freedom can be a reality on a daily basis.  No need for anything to chain me anymore.  Nothing on earth can hold me, rise oh my soul in freedom!  Unending, unerring, promise of joy, promise of peace, promise of unlimited resources for achieving liberation of the soul.  I only have to turn toward these promises everday, I only need to accept the gifts offered to me, I only need to thank my god and all the masters for their protection and guidance and in this way I will further immerse myself in the blessings of freedom.  Thank you.
