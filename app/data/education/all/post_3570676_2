One of the most important decisions that students will make in their lifetimes is what their career will be.  In order to make those decisions, they need to learn about themselves - their abilities and talents.  They need to know what careers are available.  These websites will help begin this process.  The website  urlLink www.princetonreview.com  has many resources.  I especially like under that under the career heading there is career quiz that is very simple (only 24 questions) but gives students a printout that is color coded with possible career options.  The website  urlLink www.scois.org  has a section termed Your Pathways to Success which has activities for learning about different careers.  The website  urlLink www.jobprofiles.monster.com  also gives great profile information about possible careers.
