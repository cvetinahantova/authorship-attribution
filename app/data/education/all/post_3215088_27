late for meeting today....but dont really care..haha...surprise surprise!!! My next camp is St Andrews Junior School ....still remember i conducted a leadership camp for them at the start of the month....now doing P5 adventure camp for them again....will see the little brats again...hahaha....looking forward to it though this time rd i will be activity instructor instead of group instructor.  Just heard news that i got accepted into sheares hall next semester. The cost is not cheap... I know that the annual study loan and some of my current savings plus the freelance work i am doing now will bring thru the stay. I am expecting a bursary at the end of the yr too...shd not be a problem, just that i will have to scrimp and save on my last cent. If time allows, i want to continue freelancing cos i really enjoyed the work after these few camps. I really wanted to stay in hall at to experience it during my uni life. Furthermore, i intend to take up lifesaving courses in NUS where they conduct FOC...the thing is that the courses are usually conducted in the evening. I dowan to reach home at midnite after every training. My bro stayed in NTU halls thru-out his 4 yrs there. I have a chance to stay in the last 2 yrs...especially in yr 1 but i decided against it cos i dowan my parents to be alone at home, in case of emergency. This is my last chance liao and luckily got friends help me in despite my medicore CCA points. Now my bro has completed his studies, it is his turn to be the fillial child while i go experience my last yr in NUS. I know they are concern about the cost but i really dowan to waste this chance. Can someone teach me wat to do????  :{   Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
