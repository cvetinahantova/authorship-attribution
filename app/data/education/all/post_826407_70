Been noticing more this week how beautiful this creation is.  There was the crisp Monday morning where the whole world was frosted and sparkling, silent and magical against a bright blue and golden sky.  At first I missed it, grumbling to God about the cold, and about getting the car started.  But then I sat down and saw it.  Amazing.    Then there was the kestrel on the way in on Tuesday, hovering over some unlucky prey, so graceful and yet very deadly.  I almost missed it and drove past.  And then on the way home today the sky was full of so many blues and in the centre was the smallest crescent of a moon, like a gem in the sky.    Its an amazing world and I just wander by with my head down most of the time.
