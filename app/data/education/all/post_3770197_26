We painted finally painted our benches today. Can you guess what I painted on my block? You got it! San Francisco baby! I've never been more proud of my city. Afterwards, Kristina, Katie, Diana, Nancy, Juan and I headed over to VF and had lunch at CPK, oh my goodness... the original bbq pizza was mind orgasmic -- it never tasted so good! Sorry Premier, but CPK kicked your ass this time. The garlic chicken was awesome too. Later, Nanc and Juan had to leave so t'was only KKD and me left to walk around the mall. Kristina bought me this awesome top from F21 and now I'm so in love with it! Thanks Kristina! You fucking rock! I totally owe you! I finally figured out my B2S ensemble and I don't care what anyone, especially the authorities say. I'm going to wear that top to school. Fuck the dress code! Why should it matter what we wear when what's really important is that we all graduate with flying colors? I swear, man. Our school is fucking shit, it needs to grow some balls. Anyway, today was just awesome. I've never been more happy with my bench and my top.
