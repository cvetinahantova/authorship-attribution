heh, what a way to phrase that... just got off the phone w/ my family.  i'm not licensed to say more at present, but the next few months promise to be entertaining all around.  pretty sure if we were added up to one person instead of the 4 of us, we'd qualify for "mid-life crisis" phase without question.  man, being totally vague, but quote of the week, courtesy of dad. =P  "yeah, sometimes life is like a soap opera.  when one crazy thing happens, you just gotta sit still and watch and wait for all the dominoes to fall before you do something else."  indeed, the end. =P
