I opened up my computer and secured everything with tie wraps... it's beautimous, and the tie wraps are flourescent pink. Oh, and I seperated all of my IDE cables, so they condense down... it's very clean in there, now. Of course, I left my floppy cable alone, because I doubt the floppy drive works, and I probably won't leave it in there, anyway. Also, the cord is 3 times longer than it needs to be.  It happens.  Anyway, I made a Yahoo group for anyone who wants to join... I'm going to add the join code I made to the menu on this page.    Current Music: Eagle Eye Cherry - Save Tonight
