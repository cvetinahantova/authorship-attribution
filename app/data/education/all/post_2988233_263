I haven't played with all the new stuff Blogger has to play with, maybe I should explore a little!    I could get really, annoying with the color thingy, I love color!  Especially in my blog!         Ok, no more changes I promise.       As you can tell, yesterday was a really special day for us.  This is the first time two of my kids have gotten baptized at the same time.  I was so  emotional.  Renee took the pics for me, I always forget my camera, or, in this case, the memory card was full on the digital, and the tape was full on the video camera.  I am so on top of things.       In a couple of weeks, we are having the benefit singing and dinner for Savannah.  I have so many things I need to do to help Renee.  I wish I could just read her mind and know automatically what she needs instead of her having to voice her needs so much.         I'm not one of those intuitive people who just know or just see what is needed.  I have to be knocked up side the head with a hammer to know what to do.  I love helping, and am perfectly honest when I tell you, "let  me know if I can do anything".  CALL ME, tell me, scream it at me, just let me know!
