Ah, my first "official" day as an NYC Teaching Fellow has come to a close. And I'm exhausted already.   Lincoln Center was way cool, and it was overwhelming to see sooo many people that are now, essentially, in the same boat as I am. (Let's hope it doesn't turn out to be the Titanic, eh?)  To throw flowers at myself for a minute (to use one of my favorite newly-learned phrases) they let us know that we each were selected out of a pool of over 17,000 applicants. Approximately 2,000 have been chosen to go the distance and will begin school in September.   I met my cell group, which the program calls Fellow Advisory group, FA for short. There are about 15 of us who will all be attending Queens College and will be completing the coursework towards a Master's of Education in English together. Tomorrow morning we meet at campus to begin Master's work.   It's all a little scary, but also exciting to think about the new phase of my life that is beginning now. In my circle of friends, teaching is the most popular occupation, so I'm looking forward to joining the ranks. On that note, congrats to Holly, who is going to be spearheading BJH's brand spanking new theatre program, and to AmyKatPat, who is making her way towards securing a position in an Austin-area district. I wish you both the best of luck on your new endeavors!
