There is no denying that Hawaii is one of the nicest places to be for vacation but for me it turned out to be a headache.  First of all I pulled my lower back muscle from carrying other people bags along with mine.  Second when I was climbing Diamond Head with my family I ran up the 99 steps and got so light-headed that I passed out a couple of times.  As a result of that I had to be ushered out to a helicopter to take me back down the mountain.  Next was the trip to the Queen hospital in Honolulu where they let me wait near the nurses station to get a diagnosis.  While I was there I got some pills to relax the muscles so my back could get better.  The trip home from Hawaii, I am told that my great aunt passed away this Monday.  Basically that put me over the edge and I have been pretty stressed the pass week because of all the stuff going on.
