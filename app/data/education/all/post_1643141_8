Well, I don't tend to read history books which do not present the reader with original documents as evidence.  However, this book tells history in a way which compells the reader to keep going, while the hours pass as if they were minutes. Even though Herman does go back and forth from chapter to chapter, he manages to cover as much as possible the adventures and disaventures of Scots around the world, from the days before the Union until the present.  Definitely an enjoyable and worthwhile read.
