Food fights are inevitable at the end of the school year. Rumor has it that many of the 5th graders at my school are planning a food fight as their 5th grade prank. I thought 12th graders were the only ones who pulled end of the year pranks? Anyways, I hope there will not be any bananas involved. The principal at my school can't even look at a banana without becoming nauseated and passing out...no joke. The smell, sight, or even talk of bananas is FORBIDDEN in the presence of our Principal. Just in case you were wondering, the official name of banana fear is Bananaphobia. A complete list of phobias can be found by clicking  urlLink here .
