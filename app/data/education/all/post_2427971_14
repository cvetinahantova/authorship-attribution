Woke up before my brother today, what a feat it was... Yeah, how exiting is that. Went to school, A and B-Block... Same old 'sept I actually worked in both of 'em, that was a first. Had fun at lunch, went to my house and ate most of the cookies we had. Afterwards went to Trevors and made breakfast, he's a good cook. Had a lot of fun as usual, distracted him when he was driving... Honked the horn. turned the wheel, yelled at the livestock(grade school kids). It's the best look ever to see their terrified faces look over at the monsters driving by in the car ;). I had a Bawls bottle with me so people were stealing it and gripping it all through lunch. Then I poked everyone at least once with it, fun!  So yeah, hearing rumbles in my house now... Not sure what it is, just hope it's not a gremlin or a... Ack! now my lip is twitching, that's strange... Um... I think I'm going to sleep now, going to stop obsessing over Gunbound and get enough sleep for the awesome Friday in store for me tomorrow!!!!!! W007!!!! Can't wait 'til lunch, gonna have FUN!!! And they will act the same, why wouldn't they... Your crazy, you and your brain!!! Love ya ;)
