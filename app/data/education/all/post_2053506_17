My interest in tea began not too long ago.  I guess I'm kind of a newbie to this world.  But I love it.  I am the kind of person that needs to "learn"  all the time.  I always thought tea was confusing and difficult to figure out.  But when I started swapping tea, I learned so much.  Even with the first swap. Since then I have studied and brewed tea from all over the world.  I have become addicted.  I am proud to say that.  I love being proficient in something.  This world of tea is still new to me, but I enjoy the challenge and the friendship.
