What a JOKE!!!! watched the singapore idol yesterday after the national day parade...I was quite disappointed to see the people who are so THICK-SKINNED and actually stripped to their swim-wear...hai...what is the world coming to? and there is another guy who tried to sing but we can hardly hear him..and he dared to ask for comments from the judges..haha...really quite sick.. the church staff were commenting about them today over lunch. hopefully there will be some real talents showing in the next few episodes or else I think I will stop watching it. noting beneficial to me at all...wondering where did all the talents go to... going to be more comments tomorrow in school when I hear al the teachers comments about it..haha... well, I'm going to have dinner with Eileen soon..1 more monthe before she gets back to U.S for the 2nd semester of her studies..better spend more time with her..going to really miss her...I'm still learning to be a nice bf and to learn to be a man of God..a lot of work to be done,but praise God that He is faithful....
