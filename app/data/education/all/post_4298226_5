Have I ever told you that I love U…..  No matter how many times I’ve said “I had enough of you”   Have I ever said that I really care for you…  In spite of the times that I said “I don’t care for you”   Have I ever said “U mean the world to me…  Despite I used to say “U’re nothing to me”   Have I ever?   If I haven’t…. I want to say right here right now…  That….  I Love U  I really care for you  U mean the world to me….
