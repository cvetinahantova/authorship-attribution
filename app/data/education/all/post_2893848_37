So I just got back this week from my 10th reunion at Princeton (that experience may be worth a different posting, once I've sorted out my complex feelings of nostalgia with Tom Derr, who has a doctorate in the subject - could someone force him to join this blog, please?).  I also saw the article in the NYTimes a couple of days ago about the Princeton senior who did an analysis of short stories in the New Yorker for her Operations Research thesis ( urlLink article here  ).  These two things reminded me that you can go onto a Princeton website and look up anyone's senior thesis.  Here are just a few:  Donald Rumsfeld '54: The Steel Seizure Case of 1952 and Its Effects on Presidential Powers (Politics) Brooke Shields '87: The Initiation: From Innocence to Experience: The Pre-Adolescent/Adolescent Journey in the Films of Louis Malle, "Pretty Baby" and "Lacombe Lucien" (Romance Languages and Literatures)  Jonathan Safran Foer '99: Before Reading The Book of Antecedents: Intention, Literary Interpretation, and the Hypothesized Author (Philosophy)  More  urlLink here .  Rummy was on campus for his 50th reunion, incidentally, although I never saw him.  I did see a guy I know from the class of '54, who's been married 5 times and told me that Rummy was "the best man at his worst wedding."  I did not investigate further.
