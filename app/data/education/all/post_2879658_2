It's just another manic monday!  Actually, things here at school are incredibly quiet.  No classes, no students, no work...basically that leaves me searching the internet, reading, or watching the clock anxiously awaiting the end of the day.  Anyway, last week I was one of the guest ALT`s at the Izumi High School Winter English Camp.  So here is a brief overview of my experiences at the camp.   Most importantly, it was a lot of fun and a nice change of pace from the hours I ordinarily would have spent sitting at school doing absolutely nothing.  6 of the 7 other ALT's at the camp were loads of fun and it was definitely an incredible group they threw together.  Each of us was assigned a group of 10 students (I was group B) and the camp consisted of speech presentations, culture quizes, language classes(I taught Finnish), song performances, and drama productions.  Initially I thought I was given the Best group (Group B!) but early on I learned that the B stood for Bad group.   Some of my students were caught buying beers from the vending machines (yes there are beer vending machines everywhere in this country), one was kicked out for smoking, 7 skipped the drama practices,  another likes to become sick when it is convenient and she also went home, 3 skipped the culture quiz activites....you get the idea!  Nonetheless, overall it was a lot of fun but I know that if I had been given any of the 7 other groups my experience at the camp would have been even better and more enjoyable!  I am destined to have the trouble students throughout my stay in Japan.     Anyway, that is a brief overview of my days at winter camp.  I hope all of you are doing well and that things are starting to warm up whereever you are in the world.
