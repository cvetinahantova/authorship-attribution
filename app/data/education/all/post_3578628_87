I'm looking at my clock.  It's about 9:25 in the PM.  Although this post will show a different time because that's just the way things work here at the Local Cafe.  So, in about 2 and a half hours we will have reached our one week mark.  But wait!  Technically, that's not true cause I didn't post anything at 12 AM on Tuesday last week.  I did post something at about 11:30 AM.  Alright who cares about all that BS...  I really like what you all have made possible.  I'm proud of what's happened over the week and I don't mean to sound cocky or anything but I enjoy posting and commenting and discussing stuff here.  I don't know about you, you can let me know.  But we're missing people! People that have made me what I am today and I am always happy to be around.  So here's a challenge... Let's get Allison Gill, Ambur Taylor, and Isabel Fraga in here before we hit the 2 week mark.  It's possible.  I am going to make you all administrators for a week so you can send invitations to them.  Let's go!
