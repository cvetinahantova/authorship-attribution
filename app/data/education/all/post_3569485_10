Okay, so everyone knows about Siri from reading "Life (whatever)" and she's like a total mental case! Well, the new news is that a couple of nights ago, she went out drinking with some friends and got really drunk. She then took 30 pills of Wellbutrin (which is a depression medicine that also helps her stop smoking) and she ended up having to get her stomach pumped! She's is like the stupidist person i know! I don't remember if i told you about her boyfriend Robert, but he found out about all this (and he is a really sweet guy!) and he told Alex that he knows Siri is cheating on him. Well, the day before Alex talked to Robert about this, he saw Siri on the couch in his mom's living room, going a little bit farther than kissing... if you know what i mean!!!!    So, yea thats the news for the week!
