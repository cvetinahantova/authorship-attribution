This weekend did not go as planned.  (Do they ever? I hear you query.  Yes.  Yes, they do.)      Mum and Manuel did not go out of town, so I was stuck at my own house.  Monkeypants has not gotten his truck fixed, so we were forced to take The Car everywhere.  (BLAAHHHH.)  I took a *five hour nap* on Saturday after work, completely wasting the entire evening.  Hojo cancelled our Dallas trip because she can't get out of work, so now we're having to replan her entire birthday celebration (and I'm totally crushed that I won't get to see Seester or KissKiss) and I have to decide if I'm going to give my days off *back* or continue to not come in.  Last night The Dicatator and I went over to Monkeypants's so that he could grill.  His friend (who shall remain nameless so that I can't get in trouble later) made me so horribly cranky that it could not have been a pleasant experience.      Just for the record:  I know how to wash and tear lettuce.  I know how to choose a tomato.  I know when to use oil when cooking meat and when not too.  I know the nutritional value of whole wheat versus white bread.  (BTW, as an FYI, *non* whole grain wheat vs. whole grain wheat....um, yeah, unless its whole wheat, there's not enough nutirtional value to make a difference, so you can eat white if you want to.  Potato bread is better for you that wheat without the grain.  Take that, smarty britches.)
