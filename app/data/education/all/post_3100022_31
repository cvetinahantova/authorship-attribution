Over the period of this trip I have gotten to know many people very well. Two people I have had the privilege of having deep friendships with, and of those two one has enlightened me through no conscious effort of her own will. Just her being has given me so much more in life, we have established some sort of heartfelt communication between us.   And now she is leaving England, perhaps forever.  Even though I know; I will see her again: a statement of absolute truth, I can not find the words to put to my melancholic feeling of loss. It is not loss that she is gone because our paths will cross again. It is not because I am not whole, because I am. But perhaps it is because I have had a mere glimpse of something great, and yet it is gone before I could acknowledge it fully.  Sometimes sorrow is exquisite, and goodbye seems like forever.
