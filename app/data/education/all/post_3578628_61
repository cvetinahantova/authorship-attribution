As I look through the posts here, I have noticed strangely the different subjects that have a lot pf comments.  Obviously, a lot of comments are good (can I and have I stressed that enough?), and a lot of comments means there is a lot of conflict and different opinions in those areas.  For instance, one area being the dispute over Reagan's face on the 10, the other major one being the Lawyer/Doctor thing.  I just find it interesting the things that we all find different, and yet those differences seem to keep us together.  That's just my word. Oh...and sorry for being cranky on here lately...I've had a lot of stuff bugging me...so I would like to publicly apologize for that ;-)
