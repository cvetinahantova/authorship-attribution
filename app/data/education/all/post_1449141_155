In response to weijd chung:  The one thing I take issue with is the whole idea that neo-conservatives really care about Freedom of anything besides markets.  I think that countries that give us free markets (means relatively free access by the Us to their resources) are given a free pass with all the other freedoms.  The other freedoms are nice but not sufficient cause for any concern.  Look at the middle east.  We court favor with regimes that place give us our primary object and all the others are just frosting.  They can chose who they want to lead them, but it must be someone "we can work with" or someone who will let us take what we want economically.  I am working on a presentation in the center's series of forum's "Seeking Peace in a Peaceful world" that will focus on what the nature of modern form of imperialism.
