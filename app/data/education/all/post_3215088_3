Finally!!! My first blog ....for a no lifer.   The life story of a NO LIFER starts today....no life......woke up and slacked the whole day. Called up the gang for a show, Kill Bill 2. It was good....but a bit not up to my expectation though, after watching the first episode of it. There wasn't much action and the cinematography was not as beautiful as the first episode. There is one interesting part though and that was the twist in the show where BB was alive afterall. The ending was not good....quite an abrupt ending in my opinion. KNN ( mind my language), i was expecting a big fight between Bill and Beatrice Kiddo....it ended within 10 seconds with the 5 something something heart explosion something ( forgot the name liao lah) move. Disappointing.   Went for supper with Mel and Kenneth at 107 kopitiam. Seeing Mel munching the plate of nasi lemak was indeed very tempting. But i had to endure!!! I dont feel FAT but i just dont feel good when the weight and lack of training has brought me to a level of fitness that i cannot accept....seriously hurt my self esteem with such fitness cos the only thing that i had in the past that can be considered my forte would be my fitness....i cant let it disappear. So after supper ( i oni drank soya bean drink) , i decided to walk home from the kopitiam. Feels good to walk home...long since i did that.   Hope i would not procastinate about trimming down in the next days  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
