urlLink Young Children's Emotional Development and School Readiness. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by C. Cybele Raver.  It shows how emotional development impacts school readiness.  From the ERIC Digest:  The current emphasis on children's academic preparedness continues to overshadow the importance of children's social and emotional development for school readiness (Raver & Zigler, 1997). Research, however, indicates that young children's emotional adjustment matters--children who are emotionally well adjusted have a significantly greater chance of early school success, while children who experience serious emotional difficulty face grave risks of early school difficulty. This Digest presents a brief overview of longitudinal research linking children's emotional development to school readiness and early school success and then discusses interventions designed for children entering school.
