It is so sad to see you go...and just a little scary.  A couple blocks from where I work lies a Popeyes.  I had never eaten there until one day when I came across it on my way to Taco Bell or somthing.  Ever since then, I eat there like every week (sometimes twice a week) and just rave about it to everyone.  Yes, the demographics, not only around the joint but inside the joint, are a little less then safe...it really hasn't seemed to effect me in any way.  Until today.  I haven't been there in about two weeks or so and I went around the building as usual to pull up the the intercolm,  except today the drive-thru menu was removed.  I thought, "How strange" but continuing to be optimistic I sat in the drive thru for a second.  Maybe they were just doing work on the sign, I thought.  Then I decided how rude they were not to acknowledge my existence and began to pull around.  As I drove past, I noticed that the place was vacant.  Like a ghost town.  There was a sign on the door but because I really didn't want to know why they were no longer in business, I kept driving.  The thing about it was that it was always busy.  So little is left up to the imagination.      Man, that really stinks. Thank goodness I won't be working here much longer. Sometimes knowing I was going to have Popeye's mild chicken strips with french fries just made my day.  It is amazing how the little things in life cease to amaze.      Quelle domage (french for what a pity) to all you downtowners who can no longer eat at Popeye's.
