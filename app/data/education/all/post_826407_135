I'm being a bit cheeky and avoiding marking or planning by blogging at school.  But I've got break duty in a minute (at least its a nice day) so I thought I'd take a few minutes off in my day.  Went to the 24/7 Prayer room last night.  Its ace, they always looks really good after a few days when people have made it their own.  I know the big thing about  urlLink 24/7  is that it gets people praying more and all that but I got particularly excited about one of the by products yesterday.  Its so cool to have a place that's open for people to connect with God at any point.  Like a chapel or cathedral but where they can interact, set the agenda and worship in their way.  I love it!  I guess its a bit like a third place (check out  urlLink Small Ritual  for more on that).  So powerful.  Made me think - I'd love to have a place like that permanently (Maybe the Tom's chapel already is- but I know there will be locks and security issues anywhere) where people knew that if they went there they could access worship and church - a 24hr Chaplaincy/Chill out room.  Now if it could be wifi too, well I could get very carried away here...    Oops there's the break bell.  Better go onto the yard.  Extras added 1 day later  I've had this on my mind for a while now.  Airports and Shopping Centres have chaplaincies so they must work for people.   And I remember my favourite bit of the Millenium Dome was the big chill out bubble with lights and music.  Could we not do a similar thing.  Creative, safe, welcoming chapels in "Normal" Places?
