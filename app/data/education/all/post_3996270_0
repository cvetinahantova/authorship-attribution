From what I have read and heard about nfsu2 it's gonna be an awesome game. for one instead of just selecting the races that u want to do u have to drive across town sometimes taking up to ten minutes going at max speed. The second thing that i have heard is that you can alter your sound system to big bigger and louder that all of the others in the race. This looks like it will be a nother awesome game and lets hope that it comes out soon.
