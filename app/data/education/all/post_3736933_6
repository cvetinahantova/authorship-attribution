Well my time in Athens Greece has been fantasic, I mean I really could find lots of words to describe the time I have had, but my taxi is picking me up in 15mins to take me to the airport, so I really have to get a move on.  The Greeks, they love to smoke (and smoke everywhere in taxi's, restaurants, while riding scooters and just about anytime), they love to eat (the best Gyros, souvalki and moussaka) and they love bright clothes and shoes (women in heels at the Acropolis, bright reds, oranges and yellow clothes, and lots of shoe shops.  I love the weather and the people have been so friendly and helpful with everything.  I will arrive back in Sydney tomorrow night, see you very soon, I don't really want to come home yet.
