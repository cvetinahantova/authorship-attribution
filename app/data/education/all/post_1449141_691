urlLink MSNBC - The Roots of Torture   GONZALES CALLS CONVENTION "QUAINT": In an Op-Ed in the NYT this weekend, White House counsel Alberto Gonzales tried to paint a picture of a White House committed to the Geneva Conventions.  This stands in stark contrast to a memo Gonzales sent to President Bush, obtained by Newsweek, in which he said the "nature of the new war" served to render "obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions."  from www.americanprogress.org
