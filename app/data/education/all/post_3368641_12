I am one who goes by an alias to detach my self from myself it's a constant tug of war between heredity and being a heretic  would you prefer it  if I fashioned a lie so as not to embarrass  the facade of the family let me offer you a trade:  I will acquiesce  when you can swallow this ten pound suck pill then you will know how soluble  it has been to be blood tied to your delusions  let it dissolve on the tongues of familial back biting swallow decades of degradation and of futile expectations based on nothing but an impossible climb away from the womb  ten pounds worth of  weightlessness of ideals and ten pounds worth of underachieving so we could all live up to the family tradition:  four hundred years ago fresh off the boat he started stealing horses but I trumped the bastard by riding one into the sunset... sometimes history corrects itself, too   Â©2003 DC Vision
