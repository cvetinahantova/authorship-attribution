I am one.  Hopefully, all of you are too.  I have two arms, and two legs(possibly three), and two eyes.  In fact most good things come in twos.  How do I know this?  THE PRACTICLE APPLICATION OF MATH!  On the piece of paper on which I exist(the planet Earth), the number of body parts I have are tallied neatly.  1 leg + 1 leg + 1 arm + 1 arm + 1 head + 1 body = John, 2 leg + 2 arm + 1 head + 1 body=John. Wow look at that.  John is algebra(push-up fungi[disregard this set of brackets]).  Now, for as long as I exist on paper, I will continue to eat trees to sustain myself.  WHO ARE YOU TO INFRINGE ON MY ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE??? *froths at mouth*...*begins to rip pants then reconsiders and continues frothing instead*.    Trees are cut for a reason.  That reason is math.  Forget all that was said, math is evil.  Math is depleting my stock of trees.  Less trees=Less alternative lifestyle.  Math is Anti-Gay!  Math is Anti-Tree eating!  As long as math survives the ways of the courageous tree eater will be lost forever forever in the sands of the nude beach.  For when there are no trees left, math will be dead, the tree eater will again have to eat giant insects, and nudists will rule the world.  That is the plan of the Nudists, do math to destroy trees, to make the entire world a nude beach!  So remember all of you, continue to eat trees, do no math, and curse all nudists until they abandon their plans for world domination and become docile non-math doing tree eaters once again.  Thank you and good-bye.
