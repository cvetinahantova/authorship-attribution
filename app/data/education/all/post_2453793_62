i think too much...and read into things way too much...so from now on i just won't.  i need to stop dwelling on bad thoughts and start moving on.  i care even less than before...if someone has a problem with me, that's their problem.  if they value me as a friend, they know how to find me or get ahold of me...i am done with putting in effort that doesn't get returned.  i just can't care anymore...friendwise and guywise .  i am too happy for people who play childish games to ruin it for me...
