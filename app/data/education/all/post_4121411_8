Sob Sob... finally, after 2 years of fun and studying in PESS, NIE, everything has come to an end today.I was quite happy to see my old classmates back in their graduation gown, all looking smart and ready. However there was a twing of sadness as I know this marks the end of another journey of my life...by far, this has been the happiest but most trying season of my life. Yet through it all,the many memories that I have is wonderful. Even as I think of it now, I feel the desire to want to stay longer. Now out in school, I no longer have the time to go swimming, play a game of netball or basketball with my classmates. Really missed the days of working out and losing weight...hai...
