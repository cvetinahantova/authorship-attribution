I have heard of blogging and have often wondered how one could incorporate this technology into the classroom experience in Language Arts.  It seems as if it would be a wonderful way to inspire reflection and dialogue about interaction with text among students but the big question, as always, would be about making it meaningful.  I have to admit that, with a few notable exceptions, my experiments with technology in the classroom have led to somewhat mixed results.  Students either digress too much or get so excited about the minor points of the process (graphics, sound) that real interaction with the content is remote.  I'm wondering if anyone has successfully incorporated blogging into their content area and, if so, how they did it.    Lynn
