Hi all!  Well, I've been looking around (and commenting on) all your blogs and I have to say - they look pretty good. The one thing that people seem to be having troubles with is working out what to say. This is a tricky thing - we've all got our soapboxes now, but what are you supposed to do with them?  I think we can throw quite a few ideas around on these blogs.  I'm going to hand out two topics a week for discussion - one will relate to Northern Lights, and the other will be current events/topics of general interest. If you have any suggestions, post them in comments right here at the Hub.  The next thing I'll do is put up links to everybody's blog, so you can find everyone else easily. I'm hoping that everyone will look at (and comment on) a range of blogs - read blogs that don't belong to your friends, you might be suprised by the ideas you find.  Cheers,  Zoe
