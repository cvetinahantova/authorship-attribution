In looking at the market maven lit, I'm not sure how relevant it is to our study.  Our seniors who are evangelists seem more like opinion leaders (in a particular product category, computers) than market mavens (possessing generalized market knowledge).  I don't think they were advising people where to purchase computers, what type to buy, etc.  Rather, they were encouraging adoption of the product category.   Or, am I missing something here?
