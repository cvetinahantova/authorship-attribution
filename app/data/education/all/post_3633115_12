And so another year of my life has finished and a new one begins.  I expect a lot to happen in this 27th year.  I was given my very own pair of scuba booties for this birthday. Eventually, I will be getting my own fins. I'm going to spend some time experimenting with these items and learn to snorkel.  After that, I will attempt to get my open water diver certification.  How cool is that?!  I also got to have a luverly cake decorated by Shorty with every birthday candle he could find.  Not a difficult task for a 3.5 year old, I can assure you.  We had to keep the fire extinguisher close for this one.   Thank you Kalisah for the birthday wishes.  :)  Happy Birthday to Me!
