Driveling in Stereo , folks!!    Somebody please stop me.  I am blathering in stereo again.  You would think that if I post the same article twice that I would edit out the mistakes I made the first time.   My friend Nolan just told me that behind every good writer there is a good editor.  I guess I need to find an editor that will suffer through what I do for free.....   hahahahahaha  Any starving editors out there care to take my driveling on as a side line?  I promise that I will try to say something funny atleast once per year.  Ok, how about once per month?    Stay tuned for more drivel....
