The Tony Awards were quite good tonight.  While it's always good for the one show when one show sweeps the awards, it's a lot more fun for the audience when it's all split up, and there are some good surprises along the way.  Particularly when a show like "Avenue Q" pulls best musical, totally shocking everyone.  I love shock endings like that!  Anyway, here's a short recap of the evening for those of you who missed it:  Most embarrassing job reading the tele-prompter:  Billy Joel Most overly dramatic acceptance speech:  Phylicia Rashad  (And at the Tony Awards, that's saying a lot) Most surprising presenter:  LL Cool J Question of the evening:  How long does it take Idina Menzel to get off all of that green makeup after every show? Best line in an acceptance speech:  "When we got this idea, I was a temp, and he was an intern.  Our lives kind of sucked.  We decided to write a show about people like us, whose lives kind of sucked." Most forgettable moment of the evening:  Mary J Blige's rendition of "What I Did For Love" Most memorable moment of the evening:  Hugh Jackman pulling a very unsuspecting Sarah Jessica Parker up onto stage with him, and forcing her to dance against her will.
