Aloha!  Last night was most eventful. Went into Walsall with Kat/Coz/Zeb/Laura. It was really good, way better than last time, we had a right laugh- Coz turned into a rap star (50 Pence- you'll find him in da pub), complete with bitches (me and Kat) and I flirted with Draper just for the fun of it. Got quite far, he seemed pretty into me by the end of the night, and I totally forgot about Gaz, lol, until Kat mentioned him this lunchtime, at which point I replied "Who?" hehehe. But WS1 was soooo cool, Me+Kat were dancing with each other rather (ahem) provocatively, much to Coz and Draper's pleasure/amusement/arousal. Every 5 minutes Zeb would drag me away from Draper (Booo, lol) to dance with me and shout "No!!" at me until I finally managed to convince her I wasn't going to pull him. Draper's lovely, but...I don't think so... but he's good for a laugh, and good for the practice ;o)  So that was yesterday!  Today, dragged myself into school and through my lessons, and then into B'ham, where I didn't have enough time to go to Primark- Gutted! Although I did return a gig ticket and buy 2 new ones- Wahey! Lostprophets and Hundred Reasons baby! Yeeeaaaah, Ian in the flesh- Rarrr... Also bought some lightening bolt/ dice-shaped earrings from Dotty Perks, which I have wanted for a while now, so yay :o) Then had to rush off to Digbeth bus station (beautiful example of architecture that it is) and get the coach to Worcester/ Dad's house, which is where I am now... Jimi Hendrix is blaring out of the stereo and Dad is pretty drunk, so just another normal Friday night, hehehe. I want my friends :o(  See you at the show Ceff x
