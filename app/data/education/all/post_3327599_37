That jingle always made me laugh..  Anywho, it's been awhile huh? John's been hoggin' the computer and i've been in Morris a lot lately or out.. Anyway. Everyone will be happy to hear i got rid of my overbearing p.i.t.a. we called Brandon. He took it too far sat. when he told me our fights were my fault and i just need to stop pissing him off. So i ran off with a cute country boy down in Morris. Y'all know how i like my cowboys!! He is so sweet, and he's real. He is so genuine, he tells you what he's thinkin' and he doesn't play head games.. Or maybe he just has me brainwashed already lol. I tried the whole impressing him thing i'm not sure if it impressed him or just amused him. I held a couple roosters while "Uncle Nate" cut their combs off with a pair of scissors. 2 of the 3 roosters i held got away from me. But oh well. The ride on his 4-wheeler was romantic lol. He was teasing me about squeezing him too tight but well.. That's what i get for being a chicken! Oh and get this! He was in FFA when he was in high school and he was on the livestock judging team! is this a match made in heaven or what?! ;) lol. Well i guess i'll stop babbling about him so that y'all don't throw up.. haha i'm just really happy!  He's about the most exciting thing that's happened this week. That and i got a puppy lol. In that order i promise... ahh my cookies!!!   Time got away from me.. Baking cookies.. I'm turning into a regular little suzy homemaker.. Anywho! Tiff's party is sat. I'm really looking forward to that. Gettin' to see all the girls.. I miss them. Man i'm gonna be such a mess next year. I just can't imagine leaving all my friends. Well anywho.. I need to get goin' i have some stuff to do before i leave for the auction tonight!   (p.i.t.a. is pain in the ass for those of you who don't know) (and the cowboy's name is Chris)
