hello! just got back to work after a nice vacation. yeah-i had to sacrifice my friday because it is end of the year and no one else in the office knows what to do. Kind of powerful but kind of sucky too. I can not wait to see what happens when I am on maternity. So-it's 65 degrees out here-any other time i would complain-however, being 32 weeks or so pregnant-i kind of enjoy this cool weather. later skater
