I'm sitting in an Internet cafe in Tiberius, reading though all of the emails from the group who has retured, and looking at the pictures, and wishing I had Chen to tell me some little bit of knowledge i didn't know, and to take pictures of people falling alseep or of Yossi looking big and mean.   I spent Shabbat with Ami and his family in Haifa which was very nice, and this morning took bus numbr 430 to Tiberius. The were more soliders with big guns on that one bus then I saw on our entire trip.   Tomorrow I'll head south back to Jerusalum, where I'll be staying wiht Shmulik and hopefully seeing some of the other soliders or others who have stayed over. But for now, Israel just isn't as much fun without all of you.   Happy 4th of July :-)
