Fucking hell.  Ok well I just lost my update b/c the fucking computer crashed.  Luckily I hadn't written too much.  Still, you get into the writing mode and then it's suddenly broken.  I really don't feel like going back and rehashing what I said before too.  Damnit.  Whatever.  Anyway I met Asma and Peter downtown tonight and we hit up the board game cafe.  This place rules.  Not only do they have great games but the girl who works there and speaks English is super cool.  I haven't been there in a month and she remembered my name.  To top it of she said it was b/c I have a handsome face.  I think I'll go there more often to get my ego massaged.  I love Korea.  Anyway I don't know what else I wrote but I'm not going to bother and rewrite it.   Oh I know something I was talking about was that I've found out my new love with bugs music is listening to oldies.  For a Korean run server the selection is pretty darn good.  Stuff is kind of hard to find but its there if you look hard enough.   I'm thinking about doing something with my hair but I'm not sure what.  We'll see.  I'm also debating more piercings but that is still up in the air.   Oh my oil is out so I have no heat.  Great.  At least it's not as cold has it could be or has been.  I should be thankful for that I guess.  I'm looking forward to payday.  I think I'll go shopping soon.  I feel the need to buy new clothes.  I think it's one of my short term goals to find decent clothes in this country.   Hey-Sook was busy today so I just did the usual Sunday grind and it was pretty tame.  I want to see more movie.  I really enjoy watching movies.  Maybe I should find a job dealing with film.  Anything good come out next weekend?  Probably not.  This weekend didn't take much out of me so I'm good to go something this week.  Someone call me if you want to go out and do something.   Let's twist again, like we did last summer.
