urlLink The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  Like most nomal human beings, I was excited to buy the Two Towers on DVD.  What a great movie.  In particular, the siege of Helms Deep is just a stunning battle sequence and worth watching over and over again.  As today is Labor Day in the USA, I will not labor long on a blog entry and spend the time with my family instead.  If you have free time, go and rent the Two Towers.  Even if you don't like fantasy, you will like this movie.
