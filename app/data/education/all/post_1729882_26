Just got back from a workshop on teaching writing.  It was not what I wanted or hoped for.  Writing is the "thing" in education right now.  I am looking for a plan on how to teach writing.  As usual in education, we are given a lot of theory but no practical application.  Guess I'm getting to old and set in my ways to figure this out for myself.
