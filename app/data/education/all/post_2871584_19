Well, it's been a while, and things have been moving right along.  I went to Mardi Gras and had a *fantastic* time.  I honestly can't rave enough about my vacation.  As soon as my new computer gets here (I'll give you more about that in a minute) I'll be posting some pictures from my trip for you all to enjoy...some carefully chosen pictures.  lol  Came back from New Orleans and went all the way up to Utica.  I had a job interview at Pratt, and I'm waiting to hear on that right now.  I *really* hope that I got the job.  It's almost exactly what I am looking for, and best of all?  It starts April 1.  Now I'm just playing the "waiting to hear from them" game.  I know that they talked to all of my references on Friday, so hopefully I'll get a call soon!  In other news, I ordered my new computer.  My iBook should be shipping...any time now!  I actually already have my new printer (and yet no computer to use it on--go figure), so I'm hoping my computer gets here soon!  It will be SO nice to have a functioning computer.  Woohoo!  Other than that?  Yeah...I want Pratt to call!  (I'm a little obsessed about this today, if you couldn't tell.)  Oh well.  In the meantime, back to work.    ::waits on pins and needles::
