It's audit time!  Our institutional audit is this week, and so last week (preparation) and this week (site visit) are basically shot.  I'll try to post coherent updates, but no promises.  We usually work until 9 or 10 pm each day, with little room for breaks in there.  If I survive, it will be nice when it's over.    Movie reviews:  This weekend was kind of strange movie weekend.  I had a couple of things I'd been interested in seeing that were out there, so this weekend I saw them.    Return to Me:  Okay, the whole heart beating when David Duchovny was around was corny and somewhat troubling.  It seemed more Poe than romance to me.  But I enjoyed the movie.  Minnie Driver was great in her role, and David Duchovny was slightly above mediocre.  3 stars.    Saturday Night Fever:  This was a research viewing for an upcoming event with a disco theme.  What a bizarre movie.  Maybe it was edgy and timely when it came out, but it was just really strange to me.  I got the point, but the way it was presented was somewhat disjointed and didn't keep me interested in the story.  2 1/2 stars.    I'll hopefully be back tomorrow with politics and economics, but no guarantees.
