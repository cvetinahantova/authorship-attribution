I feel as if time has stopped, as though I'm stuck in humid air that doesn't change, nor allows it's surroundings to move.  The thick, day old pea soup of my life. I stick to everything, and the tiny gnats that I'm now remembering too clearly get stuck in the tight corners of my eyes.  They force me inside at the best part of the day: when the sun goes down, the dog is calm, and the stars begin to dance.  I'm aching to dance, fly, spin, scream, cry, shout, feel alive!  I can't breath, but that's all there is to do here.  I'm resorting to old pastimes, napping, ingesting too much sitcom television.  I can hardly stop pacing in frustration enough to read, write, think about anything outside this small world.  People go to sleep at 9 PM after a few hours at the local pub that has five lonely booths, and two lonelier rugged pool tables.    I'm too critical because I don't have a life here.  People do and they love it.  Work, play, friends and family, entertainment of some sort.  Maybe someday I could, but days like this it is unimaginable.  How do people, single young people particularly, stay satisfied?  I envy their peace, clarity, and ability to make more out of a place than what is obvious to visitors.    I was once an insider, and I ran vowing never to return.  I'm now a visitor, wonder why I would ever return for such a long period of time.  The romance of coming home has faded into reality, and it is just like I remember.  The people continue to make me smile, and I wish I could take them all with me.
