urlLink This  makes me very happy. Although I did not see "the Passion of the Christ," it's nice to see alternative voices still out there. Life of Brian looks at the ways in which we choose to follow/worship in a very funny way. As an agnostic Jew, the whole Jesus/Rockstar thing makes me more uncomfortable that I really understand. I HATE violent movies, so even if I were still amongst the DINKS (Double Income No Kids) I probably would not have chosen TPOFTC.  I very seldom go to movies any more. I've seen exactly ONE movie since the birth of The Boy, and it was the horrific "Cheaper By the Dozen."  Although I did not exactly *choose* Cheaper By the Dozen. Cold Mountain was sold out and we were trying to seize the day and the free babysitting from my in-laws. So we went to a movie that said: "You should have no life beyond the needs of your children." The kids in that movie were HORRIBLE, complete brats. I thought it might be kind of a remake of the story of the Gilbreths, but although they were mentioned, it had nothing to do with them. It was not a good first movie for new parents to see. We tried to see Big Fish a few months ago, but The Boy got really upset and my mom spilled the bag of breastmilk I left her so she had to call us home before it even started. I really miss going to the movies. I'm looking forward to taking The Boy to the movies when he's old enough. I'll go see any Disney/Kid flick he wants to. My parents HATED all things Disney and it was banned from my house. My mom thought it was corny, and my dad still has nightmares about the queen in Snow White. So, no Disney for us. We didn't even own a VCR until 1986, then my mom wouldn't get a membership to a video store for another year. It's pretty funny in retrospect.  Life of Brian is one of my favorite movies of all time. It was the first time I ever saw a naked man. I don't find Monty Python nearly as funny as I used to, but I still love those movies.
