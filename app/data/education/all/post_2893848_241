What a time to be picking between the Cubs and White Sox:  With the cross-town series set for this weekend,  urlLink Mike Bauman considers the rivalry .  A line that would seem to be in direct contradiction of Scott's assessment of the Cubs:   Life is never easy, pulling for the Sox in a Cubbie world.   Everyone wants to claim underdog status, Scott.  The Cubs remind me of megapopstars who put out singles about how their sick of being criticized.  Like, poor, poor NSYNC.  They're sick of the playa hatin'.  So many people are sympathizing not because of the wrong itself, but because they identify with the wronged party.  But if this phenomenon is widespread enough, it removes the original wrong, and makes hypocrits of everyone. Nevermind the fact that the Sox have gone almost as long as the cubs without a world series.  I know it sounds like I've made up my mind.  I haven't.  I'm just being contrary.  We'll see if it lasts.
