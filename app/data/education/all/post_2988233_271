I must be right smack dab in the middle of a mid-life crisis.  Why??? Do you ask?  I want a tattoo.  You heard it here first folks, Angi wants a tattoo.  At least I think I do.  I want one for right now, but really can't see myself as a 75 yr old with a tattoo.  That is just sick.    Tommy won't let me get one.  Not a permanent one.  I think the right one, not a full body coverage is sexy.  I don't want it where all the world can gawk at it.  It is something personal.  I want it where I can enjoy it, and Tommy can enjoy it.    I've been looking at pics.  Sent him a few.  In fact, he got me started on it.  Sent me the site, but says he will draw it on for me.  I'll take that.    Oh, and for future reference, when I get thru losing the weight I need to lose, you just might catch me with my little piggy pierced!  GASP!!!!!
