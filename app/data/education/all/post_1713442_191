urlLink Wikinfo   This is another volunteer written online enyclopedia. It is a spin-off directory from  urlLink Wikipedia  using the same software but building it's own content.    Note on site:  "Wikinfo, or Internet-Encyclopedia, is a project to create a universal open content encyclopedia. The site was launched in July, 2003. So far, there are 20873 Wikinfo articles, with Wikipedia articles available via XML import. Wikinfo is a wiki: visit the help page and experiment in the sandbox to learn how you can edit any article. Inspired by Wikipedia, Wikinfo is different in a number of ways, notably, in editorial policy. Here, the main article on a subject is written from a sympathetic point of view; another difference is that Wikinfo is much more tolerant of a number of things Wikipedia is not."
