I am thinking that if I ever move out I don't want to live by myself, it's just so lonely. Like I am taking care of my neighbors friends daughter, so I am at staying with her all this week. But I have had to cancel a lot of my activies during the week to make sure I am here when she is here. So when she is at school or soccer practice I am here all alone, well they have a dog but he just likes to sleep in the girl's bed, or he just barks all the time. No fun. I am trying to look at the good in this all because I am helping this family out but, I just don't like being at home all the time. I miss my friends, I miss my brother's and parent's, and I didn't even go somewhere far, I'm just down the street! I think I have called my parent's almost every night to see if they miss me yet, pathetic isn't it? I am also thinking that when I get my dog, I want to train him to bark at only certain things like someone at the door not when people are just walking down the street or me when I am getting out of bed. It's funny to me that I am like this missing home and all. I think that my best shot would be moving out when I get married, or rooming with a friend, other than that I don't like the idea of coming home to no one. I think it will also be different when I get my own dog too because I will no doubtingly want to come home to him cuz he's my baby! I will have something to look forward to coming home to! I guess it just takes a week of not being home to make you realize how blessed you really are, and how important it is to keep in touch with family and friends. Thanks God for the reminder!
