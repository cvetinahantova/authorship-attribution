My day consisted of sitting on the couch reading (and finishing!) my book and doing laundry.  I really had nothing happen today worth blogging about.  So I tried to think of something to blog about.  I think I figured it out.  Why are most guys so into thongs and g-strings?  Is there something so special about a woman wearing this style of "underwear?"  Sure they serve a great purpose when you want no panty lines, but what makes them so special to have an entire market dedicated to them?  I know that S seems to find them incredibly enticing, and as a woman who has had a child, I can assure you that my body isn't as it once was.  Certainly not what I would consider "thong" capable.  And yet he continues to purchase and try to convince me to wear these things.  I admit that on occasion I will wear them; usually they make me feel like I'm...what's the right word...sexy, I guess.  But I just don't get the allure.  You might as well not be wearing anything.    OH  WAIT A SEC.    I think I just figured it out.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  Perhaps the allure is that there is still some part that isn't revealed, but more is shown than, say "granny panties."  I suppose that would make some sense.  I still don't think I will ever understand it though. Anyone?
