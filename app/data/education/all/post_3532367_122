Well one out of 2 anyway!   Sandra's reply was "if you need too" when I asked if I could be inside her. I think she agreed on the basis of getting more sleep if I left her alone. As far as my sleep went I woke twice during the night, then just before 06:00 I was restless because I couldn't get comfortable as my joints seemed to ache.  I finished my first box of tablets today, already I have 2 more to replace them (another 60 days), but they are by a different manufacturer. I have my first appointment with my counselor tomorrow afternoon. The thought of it is starting to make me a bit tetchy.
