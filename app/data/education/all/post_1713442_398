urlLink What Does a Principal Need To Know about Inclusion? ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest was written by Fred and David Bateman.  It discusses ways that principals can help disabled students.    From the ERIC Digest:  It is up to the principal to prepare the school and the staff for inclusion and to provide the backing, in both resources and commitment, to make it succeed. There are specific steps a principal can take to prepare staff:   * Ensure that staff is aware of the legal requirements and terms. Explain supplementary aids and services.   * Make sure that staff and teachers know that most students with disabilities are already educated in general education classrooms most of the time and are included in almost all of the noncurricular activities. Point out that the majority of students with disabilities have mild disabilities.   * Reassure teachers that while they will need to make changes in their instructional methods and materials, support will be provided.   * Explain that while many students with disabilities have participated successfully in unstructured activities, they often do better in structured activities.   * Be sure staff understand that decisions made regarding children with disabilities are individualized decisions. Some students may have needs that must be addressed outside of the general classroom, but they will be placed in outside settings only after efforts to meet their needs in the general classroom with supplementary aids and services have failed.   * Explain that large numbers of students with disabilities will not be assigned to any teacher (e.g., only one or two per class).   Principals need to ensure that students with disabilities are assigned evenly among classrooms and to provide the time and staff development teachers will need.
