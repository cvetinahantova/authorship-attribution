Good morning world!!  It is a nice crisp 32 degrees in Downtown Charleston this morning and I am coming to you live from the Charleston County Office building where I work Saturday from 7 am to 3pm.  Apparently there is a 5k run that kicked off this morning on Meeting street so that means that I am not the only one that is awake this morning.   I got an e-mail from a service called Halonscan which apparently has taken over the hosting for Blogspeak Blog comments.  Harry wrote his blogspeak customers and told us that his hosting ended sooner than he expected and Haloscan has taken over those responsibilities.  I will probably need to add some code to the Blogger template before the comments section will come back on my blog.  The blog entries that were on blogspeak were imported into Haloscan so once I add this functionality to my blog your comments will show up again.  I am on day 17 of the 40 days of purpose devotional which is from The Purpose Driven Life series by Rick Warren. I will post some more of those entries soon.  Have you gone through this devotional series yet?  If not I would highly recommend your doing so.    Katy and normally would be in Myrtle Beach SC on a Renissance Weekend get away hosted by Happy Days and Special Times in Charleston but I have to work weekends now.  So, priorities and responsibility sucks.  Instead of being in Myrtle Beach I am working which in and of itself is a good thing considering I spent most of 2003 unemployed.  I am still pretty much broke but atleast I can pay a bill here or there and child support is being paid and I am staying out of jail for now.  THAT is a HUGE benefit along with the health benefits of walking around in a 9 story parking garage once an hour.  Who said life was not fun.   LOL....  Ok, speaking of work perhaps I need to quit flying this keyboard and start my next round.    Have a good weekend.
