Therefore, SO2 is the limiting reagent.   5B  V(SO2) = 2 L  One litre of SO2 produces one litre of SO3  V(SO3) = 1 * V(SO2)        = 1 * 2        = 2 L   5C  c)	The resultant mixture is 3 L of gas, consisting of 2 L of produced SO3 and 1 L of excess O2.  %(SO3) = 2 / 3 * 100        = 66%  %(O2)  = 1 / 3 * 100        = 33%  The resultant mixture consists of 66% SO3 and 33% O2.   6A  There are equal amounts of gas (as seen by the equal partial pressures). 5 molecules of oxygen reacts with 1 molecule of C3H8. Considering that there are equal amounts of each gas oxygen is the limiting reagent. All 51.5 kPa of O2 are used up.
