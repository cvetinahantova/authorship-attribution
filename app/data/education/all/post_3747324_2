[part two]  The desks (or seats) are also designed to blend with the background.  They are also designed to fit the students according to age and size, from pre-schoolers to high school students.  A bookcase is also provided, filled with blank e-books.  The teacher can set the title of the e-books, the page range and the lesson(s) to study for the period according to his lesson plan, and the student can also customize the e-book's content design to something pleasing to his eye.  The e-books also have a filter to prevent access to pornographic or other offensive material, but can be partially overriden if such content is an important part of the teacher's lesson.  (This, of course, is subject to approval of the principal and the head teacher).
