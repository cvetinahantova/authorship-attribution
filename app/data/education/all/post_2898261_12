I don’t want to be the air you breathe I want to be the breath you take I don’t want to make you smile I want to be the lips as they curve I don’t want to make your heart beat I want to be the blood that flows I don’t want to be your world I want to be the sun that gives you life I don’t want to be the love of your life I want to be the girl you marry
