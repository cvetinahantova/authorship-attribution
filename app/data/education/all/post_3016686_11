If you saw the last Pedro Almodovar movie, "Talk To Her," you may remember that the movie is stopped cold by  urlLink Caetano Velosos's  beautiful, hushed performance of the classic song " urlLink Cucurrucuc√∫ Paloma ," filmed at Almodovar's Spanish house.  I had never heard of him until that movie, so I guess Pedro's idea worked.  He's a Brazilian singer who has been a beloved star for about 35 years.    This week he released an English language CD called "A Foreign Sound." It intrigued me because of its various covers:  Nirvana's "Come As You Are," Talking Heads "Nothing But Flowers" mixed with "Cry Me A River" and Cole Porter's "So In Love," among others.  One song that works well for me is the schmaltzy 70's hit "Feelings" - once done to great effect by Lindsey Wagner on the Bionic Woman.  (Jamie Summers went uncercover in a beauty pageant and this song was her talent act, but I digress...)  Caetano's voice is perfect for this song because he never allows it to go over the top. It's actually subtle. Less successful is his version of one of my favorite songs, "Nature Boy."  Something about the stiffness of the arrangement and the rare lack of fluidity in his voice restrains it - it does not move me at all. I'd prefer Celine's  urlLink version  to this one!  You can hear samples of the record at the Nonesuch  urlLink website .  You just need to click on New Releases and look for "A Foreign Sound."
