Today marks the two year anniversary of my mother's miraculous healing after emergency surgery to remove a brain tumor. At that time, her doctors believed she would live about one year. After surgery, radiation, and clinical trials to treat her tumor (Glioblastoma Multiforme-worst tumor there is) and through Christ and the prayers of St. Nektarios and St. John of San Francisco, there are no signs of this tumor left.  She still suffers greatly from the affects of her medication, and the cancer could reappear at any time...but for now we are thankful to God for what we have!   O Lord my Savior and my Master, I, Thine unprofitable servant, with fear and trembling give thanks unto Thy loving goodness for all Thy benefits which Thou hast poured so abundantly upon me, Thy servant. I fall down in adoration before Thee and offer Thee, O God, my praises. With fervor I cry to Thee: O God, deliver me henceforth from all adversities and mercifully fulfill in me such of my desires as may be expedient for me. Hear me, I entreat Thee, and have mercy, for Thou art the Hope of all the ends of the earth, and unto Thee, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be ascribed glory, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
