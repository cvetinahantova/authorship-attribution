Went to see  urlLink Gilad Atzmon  at the non-political Club this Friday.  I've been wanting to go to the jazz nights there for a while but never made it until  now.  Great place, great feel.    Gilad and the Orient House ensemble were amazing, The music itself was a blend of Jazz with Jewish and Arabic influences.  The band was made up of people from a variety of nations including Israel and Palestine and as such the music is a real prophetic and political statement of anger, hope and reconciliation.  The fusion of influences works extremely well and I found watching the artists collaborate and play with each other musically to be completely mesmerising.  Gilad himself was warm and funny, his asides during the music undercut any danger that the evening could become too pretentious.  Showed me again what music can be.  Thanks for taking me Ben.
