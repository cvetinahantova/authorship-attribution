urlLink BLOGGER - Knowledge Base�-�What is Atom?   Just when you thought you knew what ATOM was..... How many BLOGS or WEB LOGS do you TRY to keep up with? If it is more than two then you NEED to get with the program and install a Newsfeed reader or RSS Reader so that you can SUBSCRIBE to all of your favorite BLOGS.  When you have the urge to read or catch up on your favorite drivel spots all you do is fire up the program and have it refresh the newly syndicated BLOGS.  Then you just go to the BLOG that shows a change.  I use BLOG EXPRESS and it is VERY easy to install and use.  Just a thought folks.....  Ok, back to ATOM, enjoy this article....
