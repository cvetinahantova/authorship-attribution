*shrugging shoulder*  I just don't get it.  I knew that yesterday was Tuesday.  I successfully managed to completely miss  urlLink The Amazing Race !  Dammit.  I really wanted to see the Moms come back from nothing.  After reading about the show on their site, I clearly missed a really good episode. Damn. I think I might just have to set a timer or something next week. I'm really dissappointed to have missed it. *sigh*  Damned "quick trip" to the grocery store.
