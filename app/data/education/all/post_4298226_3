Tonight I dream of you  Being here, embrace me in your arms   Looking at my eyes  And telling me how you love me so   Holding hands, we both looking at the moon tonight  and making a vow to be true with each other  To be together no matter what   Your kiss is so gentle and so warm  And you touch my heart   When you say  You want to be with me for  The rest of our lives   You make me shed my tears  When you say  Will you marry me  And be  The mother of our childrenâ€¦
