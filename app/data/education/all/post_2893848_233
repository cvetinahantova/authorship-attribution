Don't Bother With The Local Girls   Count me among those who find Elvis Costello grating as often as I find him awesome.  There's just something about the guy that makes me wonder if some people would be less annoying if they had been bullied more as kids.   Maybe that's why I like  urlLink Graham Parker  so much.  He's like Costello but less clever and a lot more angry. (Apparently, Rolling Stone agrees: "Elvis Costello... sounded like a hoax that Parker and his sometime producer Nick Lowe had thought up in an inspired moment)."  I mean, could Costello pull off a convincing cover of that Jackson 5 song "I Want You Back"? I doubt it.    Particularly, I dig  urlLink Squeezing Out Sparks , featuring Brinsley Schwarz, an otherwise excellent backing band, and "You Can't Be Too Strong," probably the best song ever about abortion, alternately claimed as both pro-life and pro-choice.  But, of course, the song is better than that.  Not unlike Denis Johnson's "Dirty Wedding," the politics take a backseat to the emotional situation which, no matter which way you cut it, sucks for everyone involved.
