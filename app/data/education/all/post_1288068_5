Is it just me, or was that the longest week in recorded history? It just seemed to go on and on.  Still wibbling, but dealing with it the only way I know: by getting my hair cut. Long time viewers will recall that I don't really like getting my hair cut due to the painful hour-long conversation with the stylist that it entails, but in this case I'll talk about pretty much anything to get the coconut shampoo and the head massage. Anyway, that's happening tomorrow.  We are having potatoes and wine for dinner. Culinary genius!
