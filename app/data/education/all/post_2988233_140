I knew it would happen I just expected it to wait a couple of days.  But Son #1 is sick.  Son #3 is complaining, and Son #5 is still running a temp.  Not as high as yesterday, but still 101-102 .    It was funny, when he first opened his eyes this morning, he popped up looks me straight in the eye, and says "Hey, I'm feeling pretty good today"  He literally opened his eyes and does this.  Must have been some good dreamin he was doing!  I am fighting a scratchy throat myself as hard as I can.  I hate being sick, but in the summer, puuulllleeeaaassseee, it jsut is not right to get sick in summer.  It is almost like breaking the laws of nature or something.
