I didn't realize it 'til now but it would've been so much more awesome if Interpol was in lieu of Ambulance Ltd. I mean, I love Amublance Ltd. don't get me wrong. Their shit puts me on a natural high, but not as much as Elefant and Interpol put together. The funniest thing happened during Elefant's set; there was this tall, bald, masculine guy standing in front of Albert. He's jumpin' up and down going absolutely crazy for this band, singing the words to the songs and whatnot... then he puts out his hand reaching to touch Mod's hand, but apparently seems to be wanting to grab his balls instead. Albert and I both detected that the tall, bald, masculine guy was a flamer which came quite an amusement to us because we totally thought he was straight! What a way to conceal his homosexuality. Hah! How did we know this? Allow me to explain, you know if a guy wanted to reach out his hand to touch a member of the band, he'd throw his arm straight out.. yes? Now, if a girl were to throw out her arm, her arm would be slightly twisted and there would be this bump on left side of her arm and somewhat bent on the other. A feminine way of throwing out a hand, rather. Oh! On an additional note, he also kept on flicking his wrist while he had his arm out. Talk about dead giveaways.
