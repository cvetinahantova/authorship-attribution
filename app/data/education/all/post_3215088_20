Incredible!!! Vincent jio me out for dinner just now...since i free entertain him abit lor...sit his car go EAT AIR to kill boredom. Too long neber talk to him liao but seems like nothing much to talk about siah. I was quite an awkward feeling for me cos there isnt much topic except about how each other was getting along. We used to be very good friends in Sec school cos he and xiuling took very good care of me when we were in the badminton team. Had alot of memorable time with them during sec school...Ubin haunted house trek, organising BBQs for the team , fishing , going to airport eat and tutoring me in 'AO' maths in the middle of the night(though i still fail cos it was super last minute work for me liao ) ....they were my closest friends in secondary school Too bad what should not have happened, happened. Anyway, heard that xiuling is now happily married, feel happy for her too.  When for supper with Danny, Jones, Chuanlay, Daniel, Kenneth and Beng Tat ( also kenneth). Turn out to be a super tok cock cum reminiscing session when we talked about of sec school days... wah liao....bring back alot of funny memories....such as me scratching my form teacher's hand when he discovered me reading some pri school book during a reading session in sec 1 (I was just not interested in reading books then lah). Daniel's belonging's, including his pants were confiscated during chinese lessons ( heehee..i one of those that implicitly caused him to have his things confiscated) and Jone's cotton atheletics singlet that have been recycled 4 times before his wears it for his 800m race...wonderful memories.   Now back home liao .....as usual....FREAKING WARM NITE!!!!!!    Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
