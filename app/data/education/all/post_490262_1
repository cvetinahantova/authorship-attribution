Today is a "Spirit Day", "Twin Day" to be precise.  Students dress like one another and the class with the most "twins" wins... an extra recess.    An extra 15 minutes of time for me, the teacher, to run copies, cruise the staff room for snacks, go to the bathroom or just sit in the blissfully quiet classroom was enough motivation that I gave "Twin Day" as an assignment.  I actually spent 10 minutes of class time yesterday demanding that kids organize their wardrobe choices for today.  I encouraged the exchange of phone numbers, the writing of notes, whatever it took for my class to get the highest percentage of students dressed like twins!  Well, guess what?  It worked!  Now I just have to deal with the fall out of 21 third graders all hyped up because they're wearing the same thing as their friend.  *Sigh* I guess it's better than the "Candy Day" nightmare of 2003...
