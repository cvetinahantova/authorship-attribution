just came from testing and interview with maria montessori school in ayala alabang...  i'm kind of tired and hungry (because the school does not have a canteen, the principal said it's because canteens, most often than not, only sell junk food) but at least i'm one of the few who made it past phase 1 of the application process..yay!!!:D even got a compliment from the principal as she said i was "very bright" while looking at my transcript of records and test results. (though she noticed i did not do well in math..my usual waterloo..oh well)  big big smile on my face...considering there were about 30 guys an girls when we started this morning and i'm one of the very chosen 5 people who made it through..i'm just sad for the others who tried out their luck but weren't as lucky as the ones left..i had very fun and good conversations among each of the girls i got to know..maybe i'll run into them again in the future..it's a small world after all (as one of us established, realizing that a couple of the applicants knew some of her close friends from school or work)..  a girl i got acquainted with today said i looked familiar and was trying to place where she knew or saw me..just seems odd to me as i have been getting that comment almost all the time, and no matter where i am or who i am with..hmmm...  anyway, my week-long training starts monday, 7am to 4pm..have to be at red ribbon alabang town center at 7 so i can board the shuttle going inside the village and into the school..so excited actually..yay! this is definitely one of the most positive feedback i've had in a long long time..=)
