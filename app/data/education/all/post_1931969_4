That is the question!   Here are the choices for all of us on planet Europe, today on Sunday June 13, 2004:  1) Euro-elections. 2) Euro-football. 3) (special choice for mediterranean countries only): Go to the beach.  The dilemma is even more complicated given that, at least here in Greece, there is Croatia vs. Switzerland (at 7pm local time), there is England vs. France (at 9:45pm, also local time).  Then there is Formula 1 from Canada (around 11 pm).  Somewhere in between there will be all the regular talking head shows about the elections for the European Parliament held over this weekend in 25 European countries.    And of course, don't forget that there will also be more triumphant stories about Greece's victory over Portugal at the kickoff of Euro2004.  Whatever you watch, enjoy it!  Ioannis, 20040613193500
