Last night I was talking to Tommy about something and mentioned my blog, that I had written about the subject in here.  I asked him if he had read it, he said no.    Then he told me the nicest, sweetest, kindest thing.    He said he doesn't make it a point to read my blog, because he sees my blog as my personal, private thoughts, like a diary, and while its ok for people who don't know me, see me every day, etc, to read it, him and others who know me well reading it is a different story.    I was so shocked, amazed, glad, happy, you name it, blessed, that he feels that way.  Why, because it shows me that he "gets" it.  He knows my blog is my release.  Instead of keeping it all in, and stewing on stuff, I come here to release all those emotions that are going on inside my head.  My honey knows I need this.   Ain't it sweet.
