If you ever want to have a relaxing day I would definitely recommend going tubing down the Salt Lake River, it is the best experience ever! Like you don't have to do anything but work on your tan or burn in my case. Parts of it are slow and then some parts are fast rapids that make it more fun and exciting because you feel like you are doing something adventurous. The best part is if you go with a group of friends you can all sit and hang out together. I don't know why I haven't done that before I was telling my friend Amy, like the canyons are just amazingly beautiful. I love God for making his creation so enjoyable. Thanks God for making my day!!
