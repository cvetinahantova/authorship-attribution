Ah, the power of bad scripting   So, I messed up the cluster. Badly. With one fell swoop, caused by a script with a typo, I crippled all but one machine on the cluster by overwriting the shadow password files. Well, it's fixable. All that needs to be done is take the hard drives out of the other machines, mount them on the one good one (good thing that they're hot-swappable too) and replace the shadow file. What ticks me off is that I could fix it myself if I was there. But I'm not. So I can't. Which sucks. Big time. Through a rubber hose.  Well, on the good side of things, I found  urlLink this  neat origami site. And a good  urlLink quiz  to keep the moods up.
