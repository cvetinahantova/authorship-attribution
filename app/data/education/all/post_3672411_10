Well, we've hit the first snag due to lack of attention to detail at the immigration office. I got an email from my HR guy saying the officials need an english translation of my  urlLink Latin Diploma  when there is already one on the back of the degree.  *sigh*  Now we've lost a day on the FedEx-ing. I wish people would pay closer attention instead of jumping to conclusions and spazzing out sometimes.
