went out to Emma and Jude's birthday party last night to the forum only to be turned away for being too casual.   Now I know that my own particular approach to sartorial elegence slouches towards the scruffy side at times but the Forum?  THis was once the epitome of layed back coolness.  So I had to go home a change grumbling all the way about Style Fascists but deep down being cross with my self that I am no longer cool.  After that the night was a lot of fun though.
