First Comprehensive Report Finds Most Democratic Presidential Candidates Reflecting - Not Leading - Public Opinion on Gay Issues Gay Vote Represents Close to 10% of the Vote in Democratic Primaries      WASHINGTON - May 28 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) Policy Institute today released the first comprehensive report of the positions of the 2004 Democratic Presidential candidates on key gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) issues. The 2004 Democratic Presidential Candidates on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Issues finds that while the candidates - as a group - hold the most pro-GLBT positions ever taken by a field of candidates for President, the majority are not leading but reflecting public opinion.  "Contrary to assertions of conservative pundits, it's clear that the Democratic candidates cannot be accused of 'pandering' to the gay community," said Matt Foreman, NGLTF Executive Director. "By and large, their positions aren't 'leading' the fight for equal rights, they simply reflect the overwhelming opinion of the American public."    http://www.ngltf.org/library/index.cfm urlLink     urlLink http://www.commondreams.org/news2003/0528-05.htm
