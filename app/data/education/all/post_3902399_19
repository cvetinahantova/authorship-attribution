Nepotism:  (n)  1. Favoritism shown or patronage granted to relatives, as in business. 2. Undue attachment to relations; favoritism shown to members of one's family; bestowal of patronage in consideration of relationship, rather than of merit or of legal claim.  Nepotism can be similiar to being born into a Monarchy. You don't actually possess the qualities to be a leader, a king, or president, but, you have the connections. Is it okay? What about if you started your own company and you son/daughter comes to you for a job(just barely passing college), and you have an application on your desk from a graduate that is highly qualified. Who do you choose? It is an ethical choice? What ever happened to making a living for yourself? Making your own name? Self-made Millionaires?  Large corporation CEO's, Hollywood actors, and even political figures all reserve the right to use nepotistical censureship with their family? What's in a name?  urlLink
