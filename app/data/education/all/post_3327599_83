It's so funny Teri should mention Redneck Ray lol. i saw Lil Redneck Ray (bradray) today. he was on the side of highway 75 tieing down some lawn mowers in the back of a pick up.. anyway.. so Teri.. you're moving? where? out of our school district we all hope.. lol jk. we need to hook up some time maybe you wont be busy shopping.. lol. oh i got a call from John Kyle about a dinner at the end of the month.. only he didn't tell me what time it starts. if ya know what time and if you're going, let me know. i don't wanna be the only one there.. but i was planning on dragging Phil with me.. he just doesn't know it yet..   anyway.  today was ok. Becky and Andrew babysat with me. we sold lemonade.. it sucked. ok so i'm definetly fed up with the whiney thing the older one has going on.. i'm gonna shake her next time.. not really but it sounds like a good idea. anywho..   Phil and i went to the mall tonight. he was like a little kid at christmas when i told that the new ATHF dvd came out today.. so cute haha.. i get to borrow it.. since you didn't even know it was out yet.. it's only fair.. besides i'll make it worth it ;-) haha. a discussion about me and pregnancy came up like 3 times tonight.. that was odd.. anyway! we had fun.
