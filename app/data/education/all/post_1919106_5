Friday night happenings   After anime club we went to the Lotus Cup. They were having erotic poetry night, and it was a blast. There was so much fun stuff going on, my sides were bursting. After that we dropped by Carol and Amber's and I made milanesas a la napolitana (unfortunately we didn't get the right bread... sure, pan lactal is the easiest to use, but I should have gotten mignoncitos). Oh well, everyone  liked my meat , and Carol got disturbed when I was  stroking my wood  in her kitchen *hehe*.
