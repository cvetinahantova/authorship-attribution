Kill the fatted calf, somebody! Wayward blogger  urlLink Todd Hunter , voted by someone as  urlLink the worst blogger of 2003  for his lack of blogging consistency, has found his way home. But he's had a busy year on several fronts and should get an excused absence from the blogosphere. Todd now leads  urlLink Alpha USA  and articulates some great ideas about making the Christian faith relevant to the world. I met Todd Hunter at  urlLink Search Party 2002 , during which time he shared some great stuff. I hope he'll continue to share his thoughts on his new weblog.  And for those interested about his plans for AlphaUSA, here's an interview from  urlLink Off the Map .  Link via  urlLink Charlie Wear .
