Sometimes I miss the carefree days of highschool.  Then I come home to visit my parents and that cures that.  I love my family.  I just don't like all the tension in the house.  It's a long battle between the younger sibs and the parents.  Occasionally they try to score points with the parents by ratting each other out.  Other times they cover for each other.  So far no ones winning.  The oldest of the younger set is about to move out.  The middle of the younger set is being sent to the Chandler's Ranch for a month in hopes of staighting him out or at least giving the parents a break. Really I just miss the constant companionship of my friends.  It's hard to be so lonely all the time.
