Work:  Pages read: 0 Pages written (non-fic.): 1 Pages written (fic): 1  Comments:  Today wasn't quite as useless as the "stats" make it look.  For one thing, I finally wrote a page of my dissertation--the first one I've managed all month.  I spent at least a couple of hours dealing with students and class-related issues, and managed to make it to the library and Post Office before they both closed.  Although I only managed a page today, I'm about halfway there in terms of writing chapter one of TGoP.  I do need to get my rear in gear in terms of non-teaching academic work though, because July is going to fly by, and I will be very busy in August (I am so glad I decided against going to the conference in mid-August--I'd be ready to kill myself now).  My life is going to be so harried until January that I can't really imagine it.  The major hassle of the day had to do with horse insurance, which ends up being a pair in my rear every single year no matter what I do.  In smaller news, I installed Firefox today after reading about the latest  urlLink IE fark-up  on CNET.  Tabbed browsing is indeed very cool.  I also heard from a friend that had been "ignoring" me for some time--it was nice to get a long email from him...helped convince me that he hasn't suddenly decided to start hating my guts (good to see that I'm so secure in myself).  His birthday is Sunday and my best friend in grad school's birthday is tomorrow, and she returns here on Sunday or Monday, so I need to find her a nice gift!  The boyfriend is still out of touch, so I probably won't hear from him 'til Sunday or Monday either.  I was also able to get in touch with Sean via phone, so that's another goal achieved.
