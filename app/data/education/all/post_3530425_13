OK.  In 15 minutes, I have a date to IM with some university prof whose profile I found at personals.yahoo.com.  What's weird about cyberdating, is that people jump right in to some really personal stuff, just because they're hiding behind their computer screen.  Things like sex, and what they're looking for in a relationship; stuff that shouldn't really come out until at least a couple of weeks or more down the road of the relationship.  And we make value judgments based on these Internet Message chats.  Like this crazy guy, Mike, who, when I said I wanted to date (read, sleep) around, got all pissy, and said I was a freak.  Now, if some guy told me that, I'd think, typical, and move on.  But I'm a woman, and I may want to keep my options open (to use a euphemism for sleep around), so I'm a freak.  But maybe I don't want a boyfriend.  Maybe I want to choose the horse of the day from the merry-go-round and take the ride of my choice, depending on my mood.  Maybe one day, I ride in the carriage. I just want some nice, quiet ride, nothing flashy.  But maybe some days I choose the flashy black horse, head reared back, hooves prancing, nostrils rimmed with red -- just for a change of pace.  Or maybe the dromedary (some merry-go-rounds have exotic animals to ride), because he has two humps (rim shot, groans from the intelligentsia).  Maybe I just will.    Or maybe I'll get a boyfriend who wants me badly, shags me madly, is dumped by me sadly.  Hah!  I could have hand.    You know what I want?  I want the upper hand.  I want hand with some guy, and I want to exploit it.  No, it's not very nice, but hell, it's my blog -- I can fantasize any way I want.
