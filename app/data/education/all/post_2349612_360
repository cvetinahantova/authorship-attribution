i did it again -- i freaked out tonight:  BlkDeth 13: hahahahahaha BlkDeth 13: dont make me call you out of spite. lkp 42 42 42: i'm really not that entertaining when i'm tired BlkDeth 13: it is for spite, not entertainment!  hahahaha lkp 42 42 42: so you'd like your first dialogue with me to be me yawning and then hanging up? BlkDeth 13: rofl BlkDeth 13: it was an empty threat. lkp 42 42 42: right now i'm about to fall asleep, seriously... just gotta wrap up like 3 conversations on IM here lkp 42 42 42: will we talk before we actually meet each other though? lkp 42 42 42: (phone is now off and charging for the night anyhow :-P) BlkDeth 13: i'll work on that. BlkDeth 13: *nod* lkp 42 42 42: good plan  at least i told the actual truth this time -- but dude, why does the phone freak me out?  then again, as the ever wise eric said:  Galois1105: i think if you're afraid of it being weird [meeting in person], then you should talk to him on the phone Galois1105: at least some of the weirdness will happen over the phone that way  we shall see...
