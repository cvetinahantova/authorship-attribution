I've been trying to publish an op-ed piece on this subject for months, but have given up and decided to publish it myself. So there! Seriously, this was one of the reasons for developing my own blog. So here it is ...       Gays, Marriage, and Civil Rights  Robert Tobin, Whitman College   Although the Federal Marriage Amendment has been stopped in the Senate, its backers vow to return to the matter next year. In the meantime, supporters of the amendment intend to take up the matter in the House of Representatives and plan to push a flurry of referenda against gay marriage in the individual states. Perhaps this would be a good time to step back and take a look at the history of homosexuality, marriage, and civil rights. In fact, this debate is not new: calls for gay marriage are as old as the concept of homosexuality itself.    In order to have gay marriage, you need to have gay people. The statement may seem obvious, but for much of human history, people were not categorized as homosexual or heterosexual. But once you have categories of homosexuals and heterosexuals—and the people in those categories are classified neither as criminals nor as mentally ill—then it becomes very hard to deny them the rights granted to other citizens.    1869 is often considered the “birth of the homosexual.” In that year, the German-Hungarian liberal activist Karl Maria Kertbeny coined the term “homosexuality” in an appeal to the Prussian Minister of Justice to decriminalize sodomy.    Significantly, the term appeared in the context of the political debate about the shaping of the new nation of Germany, which was to be established in 1871. Liberals such as Kertbeny wanted to be sure that equal rights would apply to the newly minted category of the homosexual.    Kertbeny’s ally on many of these issues was a Hannoverian lawyer named Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. In the 1860s and ‘70s, Ulrichs published a series of brochures demanding rights for men who loved men and women who loved women, whom he called “urnings” and “urningins” respectively. Not only did Ulrichs fight for the rights of urnings, he also came out as one, both to his family and—astonishingly—to the 1867 meeting of the Association of German Jurists in Munich.    In 1870, Ulrichs published the first issue of what he hoped would become a journal called Prometheus for his fellow urnings and urningins. In it, he argues for the biological nature of sexual identity and calls for coalitions between urnings and other oppressed minorities of religious and racial groups, including Jews and Catholics.   At the same time, he wants to know why the state and the church cannot sanction the union of urnings, as it sanctions the union of men and women. If there are individuals with an innate predisposition to love members of their own sex, he asserts they should be allowed to marry. Already in 1870, there are explicit calls for gay marriage.    Kertbeny and Ulrichs were both far ahead of their time. Sodomy remained illegal in the new German state and stayed that way for a century. Gay marriage had to wait even longer before it became the subject of political debate again.    Nonetheless, there are some lessons that deserve to be learned from this chapter in the history of sexuality. Once homosexuals are no longer considered criminal or mentally ill, it becomes hard to deny them the rights granted other members of society. Far-sighted liberals like Kertbeny and Ulrichs saw that over a century ago, and a slim majority of our senators seem to understand it now.        There's  urlLink a very thorough webpage on Ulrichs . Not much on Kertbeny, until I get on with my own writing!   Previous posts:   urlLink Liberal/Libertarian Views on Gay Marriage   urlLink HRC Ad   urlLink Lynn Cheney   urlLink Gay Marriage
