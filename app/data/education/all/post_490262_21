1. What's your favorite animal?  Cats.  I envy their lives...   2. What pets have you had in your lifetime?  Several cats, a rabbit, guinea pigs, various fish, hamsters, and dogs.   3. Is there any specific pet that you've wanted but never had? Why?  A horse. It goes with the whole "living in an old farm house" fantasy I have.   4. Are you allergic to any animals?  Nope.   5. Do you have any 'pet' pet peeves (your pets or others')?  Dog hair on everything.  I love our white lab-mix, Honey, with all my heart but there is white dog hair on the sofa, the hardwood floors, everywhere.  I'm always vacuuming or sweeping.  I also don't like dogs that jump up on people (and our beagle does that so who am I to talk...).
