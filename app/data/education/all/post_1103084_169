............ express ............  i'm blogging from the express terminal at the library.   one would think that such restrictions might help such an over-expressor be a bit more succinct.  but maybe not, since i'm just in it for the experience.   what is it like to live in fast fifteen minute increments?   we sit in lines at fast-food to-go windows, we order out or order for delivery.    at school we learn the great classics in fifty minute time slots.   i just read about a playwriting contest that is for ONE PAGE plays.  music videos collapse the filmic tradition, popular music and marketing blitzes into a six minute visual poem that should express the breadth and depth of meaning and feeling in a song (and/or available on that artists album)  one minute dating allows people to have one minute conversations with a number of available and interested partners in a noisy restaurant room.   hot or not condenses the experience to an even quicker click of the mouse.   outside the window suvs and trucks and minivans zip by into the next fifteen minute increment of their worlds.   but the sunshine and the cedar trees and the unevenly faded red bricks of the Hoover Plant feel much less ephemeral.  They seem to be unphased by all the zipping and zapping.   Christian once commented on a blog that one of the best reasons to affiliate and jump into an institution's life -- and out of the chaos of liminality is because insittutions slow down the experience of time.   I'm intrigued.  Because the pop window that just warned me to save and exit (i have four minutes remaining) tick, tick, tick, is making me almost as nervous as the boundless energy of the two three year olds dancing around their mother next to me -- as she tries to move away from their insistence into a focused zone of choosing a book on kitchen rennovations.  tick, tick, tick.
