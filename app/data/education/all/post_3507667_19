I had to make a decision today. It was a very tough decision and it's something that I'm probably going to regret.  Let me first say that I got the job I wanted in Ottawa. They were extremely impressed with me and my experience and they were very eager for me to begin with the company. The catch was they needed me to start tommorrow, or Monday the 12th/2004.  Now, I could probably have swung this, I have friends in Ottawa and family there as well, so getting set up this quickly would have been difficult but possible.  However, the problem arises that my daughters are tremedously upset by the move. I handled the situation wrong by not giving them time to adjust to the change. Having had their mother leave them and not communicate too much with them has polarized them with the belief that if we move, they will no longer have contact with their aunt, grandparents, cousins, and 2nd cousins. Even though I did my best to try and explain things, it was all happening far to fast for them to adjust to.  So here is the decision. Do I take a job in a place that I have been wanting to move back to for several years now with a pay increase of 20+k per year and have the ability to socialize with friends that I dearly miss or do I spend another year in N.B. and prepare my children for the move, thus giving up this opportunity in hopes for another when the time comes. On the plus side of this, I can save alot more money that what I have and make the transition easier.  I chose to stay.  I'm terribly saddened by it all but I have to think of the girls first, and of their needs. As selfish as I would like to be and say, "they'll get used to it", I don't think this would be true. They have suffered quite a bit of loss and pain in their little lives, and I'd as soon spare them any further hardship if I can.  One more year.  (sigh)  RLB
