On June 14th, my old pal  urlLink Patrick Somerville  will read from his  urlLink One Story  publication in NYC at  urlLink Arlene's Grocery .  If you're in the area, please attend.  An excerpt:   I had been involved in pressurized and spray-on cheeses for over a decade. I would say that only three or four men in the American gustatory industry—DeGrolun and Franklin unquestionably, Carmichael and Nussbaum perhaps—knew more than I did about the canning and containment processes of integrated synthetic cheeses. I spent six years at Frito-Lay and was independently contracted at Oscar Meyer during their mid-nineties run at the first pre-cooked cheese hotdog. I was there to provide information concerning the possible manipulations of ewe milk.   Congrats to Pat.  The story looks great; I'll be ordering my copy.
