So, I got up pretty late today. Still laying in bed at 6:30 in the afternoon. I'm up now, but goddamn, 6:30 in the afternoon? That's late. I was laying in bed, wishing I had the strength to get up. If Spiderman could do it though, so could I... because I am so much stronger than Spiderman. Got that? Good, I'm glad we had this conversation.   So I envisioned myself moving the pillow that I was holding onto and getting off the bed. I burst with energy and threw the pillow behind me. I leaned back... and oh no, I was leaning on the pillow. It was so goddamn comfortable. Can't leave... comfortable... pillowy softness... heaven. So I layed there for a few minutes more and then got up without any thought.   I looked down, right, and I hadn't any "clothes" on. Well, pyjamas, but they don't count. The Sandman made pyjamas. Why do you think you go to sleep shortly after you put them on? It's an evil spell! Your bodily functions are slowed down and you are reduced to a motionless state. The Sandman can now rummage through your stuff and play strip poker with your mom. You will wake up and never know what happened, because your mind was in a whole other place! What an evil trick!   So I went rummaging through my dresser drawers. I found an orange t-shirt and a pair of black jeans. Orange and black, my favorite colors, aside from blue.  Life is good.
