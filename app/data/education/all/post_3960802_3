When I woke up this morning, the first thing I thought of was "This is the last day of my diet.  Get through the day and tomorrow at this time, you can EAT!!!"   Tim and the kids and I are all on the fat burning soup diet.  It's a seven day fierce effort to lose some weight before vacation, at which time I will gain it all back again.   The first three days involve a lot of fruits and vegetables and THE FAT BURNING SOUP.   this is a concoction made of celery, green onions, green peppers, tomatoes, cabbage, and carrots in a Lipton chicken bullion base.  The soup is eaten everyday.  According to the instructions, it takes more energy to pass this stuff through your body than you get from the calories it contains, so in essence, the more you eat, the more weight you lose.  This would be great, except it tends to turn on you after two days.  Or as Sam put it this morning: I'd rather eat my own vomit.  Anyway, it's now 8:30 pm and I think I'm going to make it.  I have lost 7 or 8 pounds.   Was it worth it?  Yeah.   Also, according to the plan, the diet also does a detox of caffeine and sugar addiction from your system.  If that were so, why is it the first thing I plan on eating tomorrow morning is the sweetest cereal I can find?
