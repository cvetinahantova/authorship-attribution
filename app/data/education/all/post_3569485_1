Okay, yesterday my mom asked Alex if he could clean my carpets with our carpet cleaner. My mom and I took all of my stuff that was on the floor and we put it up onto my bed. Then, today when my mom went down there to do some cleaning, she found my air freshener that was plugged into my wall, up on my dresser. Since i have a fancy cover like thing on my dresser it was really hard for her to see that it had leaked all over my brand new wood dresser. When she told me to come down there I saw the finish bascially scraped off of the whole entire left side of the dresser! My mom was so pissed that she kept saying "God, all i ever do is ask him to do simple things and he can't even accomplish that!" So, yea that's basically the news and I havn't seen Alex yet, but im sure that when my mom see's him, it's not going to be very pretty!
