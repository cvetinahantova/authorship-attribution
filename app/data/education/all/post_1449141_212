something to celebrate!    Dear MoveOn member,  This isn't an email asking you to sign a petition or give money.  It's simply a celebration of a victory.  75 television executives from network affiliates descended on Capitol  Hill yesterday to prevent the House appropriations committee from  voting for a partial rollback of the FCC rule changes.  Because of you and thousands of others, Congress did something  unprecedented yesterday. Republican committee member Frank Wolf urged  his colleagues to vote their conscience, and stand up to the  lobbyists. And they did just that, delivering a 40-25 vote against big media.  Conservative columnist William Safire wrote in today?s New York Times: "Here is what made this happen: Take the force of right-wingers  upholding community standards who are determined to defend local  control of the public airwaves; combine that with the force of lefties eager to maintain diversity of opinion in local media; add in the  independent voters' mistrust of media manipulation; then let all these people have access to their representatives by e-mail and fax, and  voilï¿½! Congress awakens to slap down the power grab." (URL below)  The rollback still has a long way to go, but this is another big step  in our march to reverse the FCC and create a more diverse, independent and skeptical media.  Your active participation is working. Congress is listening. There  will be more work in the weeks and months ahead. Stay tuned and stay  involved.

Check out William Safire's editorial and another article from today's New York Times on this win:  HOUSE PANEL ADDS VOICE TO OPPONENTS OF MEDIA RULE By Jacques Steinberg, New York Times July 17th, 2003 http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/17/business/media/17FCC.html "The recent decision by federal regulators to loosen media ownership  rules, already under fire in the Senate, took another blow in Congress yesterday. This setback was dealt by the House Appropriations  Committee, which approved a budget amendment that would make it harder for big broadcasting companies to acquire more television stations.  The vote represented a defeat for Michael K. Powell, the Federal  Communications Commission chairman, who has led the effort to change  the rules. It was also a rebuke to the Republican House leadership and the Bush administration, strong supporters of the commission's  efforts."
