Yesterday I drove up to visit a friend of mine who lives north of Seattle (from where I live south of Seattle) in the pouring rain.  It was about an hour drive which gave me a chance to ponder certain things (and you a chance to see the pettier side of Erin).  Here are some questions I have:  ~Why, in a place famous for rain, hasn't the DOT come up with some sort of drain to put on the road so standing water/hydroplaning doesn't totally #@%! up the commute? ~Why would you stuff that little back shelf in your car with stuffed animals unless you  wanted  to be mocked and ridiculed? ~Semi trucks.  Necessary for life?  I think not.  Get off the road!  Or at least stay in the right lane.   Whew!  I'm glad that's out of my system.  So, the week is over and next week it's back to work.  I can't say I'm really looking forward to returning.  All you out there who are not teachers and work pretty much every week are feeling very sad for me, I know.  Just take a peek at my paycheck before you hate me for my time off :)
