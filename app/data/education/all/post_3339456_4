The US has unveiled a new  urlLink UN security council resolution  on post-occupation Iraq, if it can be called that, in which any US soldiers serving in a UN force who commit war crimes will be  urlLink immune from prosecution .  This, at a time when evidence US soldiers abuse of prisoners in Iraq is surfacing.  What can this immunity be based on?  It can't, while keeping a straight face, be based on any pretense of virtuosity.  Rather, it is based on the abuse of power by the powerful.  We have seen that in the prisons as well as in the security council.  It is resurfacing there.  It looks like the security council resolution will be put to a vote next week.    This is vitally important.  Do not let this cynical manipulation succeed.  Contact your  urlLink ambassador to the UN , and tell them to strongly oppose this resolution.  If you are a US citizen, contact your president, member of congress, etc, and remind them about the US concept of "justice for all".
