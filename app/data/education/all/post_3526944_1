So, short entry today, mainly because I'm too impatient to sit and write. So, what happened today? Here's a quick recap: Got pulled over and had to take my car to get an inspection Found out that you can't have any secrets in my family, and everyone knows I'm coming home Venus passed through the Earths line of sight with the sun (cool) Thousands of people continued to mourn Ronald Reagan's death.  To commemmorate the last one, here are some Ronald Reagan quotes you may not see in the tribute articles about our 40th president:  "I am not worried about the deficit. It is big enough to take care of itself."  "Facts are stupid things." â€“at the 1988 Republican National Convention, attempting to quote John Adams, who said, "Facts are stubborn things"  "Trees cause more pollution than automobiles."  "Politics is supposed to be the second-oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first."  We'll miss you Ronnie...not as a president, but as a constant source of entertainment.  And on that note, here's my quote for the day (well, week since I'll be gone for a little while): "Politics is just like show business. You have a hell of an opening, you coast for awhile, you have a hell of a closing." ~ Ronald Reagan
