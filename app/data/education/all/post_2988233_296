From the first time I heard this song, I loved it, it is my theme!  So here it is, on my blog!  YeeeeeeeeHaaaaaaawwwwww.  Well I ain't never Been the barbie doll type No I can't swig that sweet champagne I'd rather drink beer all night  In a tavern or in a honky tonk Or on a 4 wheel drive tailgate I've got posters on my wall  of Skynard, Kid and Strait   Some people look down on me  But I don't give a rip I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip   Cause I'm a redneck woman  And I ain't no high class broad I'm just a product of my raisin'  And I say "hey y'all" and "Yee Haw" And I keep my Christmas lights on,  on my front porch all year long And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song   So here's to all my sisters out there keepin' it country Let me get a big "Hell Yeah"  from the redneck girls like me Hell Yeah Hell Yeah  Victoria's Secret  Well their stuff's real nice  Oh but I can buy the same damn thing  on a Wal*Mart shelf half price  And still look sexy Just as sexy As those models on TV No I don't need no designer tag  to make my man want me  You might think I'm trashy  A little too hard core But get in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door  Hey I'm redneck woman  And I ain't no high class broad I'm just a product of my raisin' And I say "hey y'all" and "Yee Haw"  And I keep my Christmas lights on, on my front porch all year long And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song  So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country Let me get a big "Hell Yeah"  from the redneck girls like me  Hell Yeah Hell Yeah   I'm redneck woman  And I ain't no high class broad I'm just a product of my raisin' And I say "hey y'all" and "Yee Haw" And I keep my Christmas lights on,  on my front porch all year long And I know all the words to every Ol' Bocephus song  So here's to all my sisters  out there keeping it country  Let me get a big "Hell Yeah"  from the redneck girls like me  Hell Yeah Hell Yeah Hell Yeah Hell Yeah Hell Yeah Hell Yeah I Said Hell Yeah  Excuse the profanity, my parents didn't raise me to day that, but I mus say, the rest of the song is true!  I'm just a redneck woman thru and thru.
