Well, my daughter was finally asked to prom on Monday, four days before the event. Naturally the week was a flurry of dress shopping, nail fixing, hair doing, pins finding, jewelry buying, etc. The long and the short of it is that she had a marvelous time which I'm glad about, but it got me thinking...what happened to prom? Everyone around me keeps saying that the entire thing has gotten out of control. "It didn't used to be this way...we didn't rent limos (not necessarily a good thing, what with teen drinking,etc) and we didn't spend $350 on a dress (wow, do people really do that?) and and and..."  I always thought proms were a right of passage -- the teen entry into adulthood and society, but then again I didn't grow up in this country, so I'd could really do with an education.   Oddly enough this didn't come up two years ago when my son went to prom -- but suddenly it's more of an issue now that my daughter has alighted the stairs dressed in gown and finery really more suited for an embassy ball.
