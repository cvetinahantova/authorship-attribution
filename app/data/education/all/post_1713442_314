urlLink That Tangled Web  This is by Kerry S. Kilburn from his Dr. Mom's Guide to College.  I found his site while editing at the Open Directory Project today.  I of course added it to the ODP.  From the site:  1. The internet is a wonderful thing. The resources that are now available on-line are unbelievable to those of us who did all this in the dark ages of slide rules and keypunch cards (if you don’t know, don’t ask). Even though it has wonderful things to offer, though, it is not your one-stop-research-shop, and a healthy dose of skepticism is an important tool for any college surfer.  2. The list of web sites you should be familiar with begins with your college’s own site.  Increasingly, students are expected to use their university’s web site to monitor their academic progress, register for classes, pay fines, search the library catalog, get e-mail from faculty members, and more. So spend some quality time surfing through it and bookmark essential sites (Student Services, the Registrar, Financial Aid, student organizations, etc.). Look at it this way – if nothing else, you’ll be able to amaze your friends and instructors with your ability to locate obscure web pages (“how to sign up for the distance education underwater basketweaving section” . . .).  3. In case you hadn’t figured it out by now, anyone can create web pages and post anything they want on the web. Just because it’s online doesn’t mean it’s true, relevant, or legitimate to use on your latest term paper. Learn to evaluate web sites with the same care you evaluate other information sources and avoid the pitfall of thinking that the web is a legitimate substitute for the campus library. And forget you’ve ever heard of sites that post student research papers “for information purposes.” Really.
