Wow, it's been a long time.  There was a crash and burn, and I decided I didn't want to write for a while.  It's like when your train of thought leads to the MOST embarassing thing that you've ever done - completely by chance - and you quickly try to think of something else.  Writing in this blog was too painful, since it dealt with the instigation of my crash and burn... but we won't talk about that.  So, Kathy is dating a new guy named mark, who I have met a couple of times.  He is very attractive, but in a slightly nervous and weird sort of way.  I am so jealous.  But not really, because Kathy is amazing and deserves an attractive guy who has the capacity to blush is a really genuine way.  Anyway, I know he worked at the library, since that is where Kathy picked him up.  I went yesterday to get some journal articles, and I was making a conscious effort to look for him, but I have misplaced my glasses, so if a person is further than 4 feet from me, there face is a blurr.  In general, I don't wear my glasses out and about, though, so I have become rather adept at recognizing people from their gait and their hair sillhouette.  I am standing in line at the counter, and I think I see mark, so I am staring at him trying desperately to figure out if it's him, but his hair is off, and he is not walking, so gait is out, when he waves in my direction.  But I am still far enough away that the wave is ambiguous.  Is he waving at me, or the guy behind me?  Or is he not mark at all, and is waving *because* I am staring?  So I don't wave, and stop staring.  Eventually, mark comes over and we chat for a bit, and it becomes very obvious that he has cut his hair... Mark is on dangerous ground, I tell you.
