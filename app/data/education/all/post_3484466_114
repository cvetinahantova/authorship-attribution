Hmm... I just saw my clock in the mirror, and it said 12:51... and then I turned around, and it said the same thing. Nifty. Anyway, I keep catching myself gazing at my bed, or at that pile of soft stuff over there, or whatever... It's really hard to will myself not to go to bed... mind over matter, eh? I really need to find something to entertain myself with.  Current Music: Norah Jones - Sunrise
