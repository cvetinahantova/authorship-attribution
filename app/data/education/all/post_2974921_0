i'm talking to a new friend of mine. his name is jammi[cute no?]. he's from ahs and a poetic musician. i like talking to him. there's no romance just friendship. this is the kind of friend whose a guy i want.  dayrl and i haven't spoken to each other again. i miss her. i just hate it when she acts all gloomy around me while she acts so happy around the others. it's vey offending. maybe i just find it so because once i'm gloomy around her, i'm angry to everyone else. mean, huh? hey, it's me. no lies...the first truth i ever said about me.  earlier this morning, mrs. franco cried in front of us. i couldn't blame her after she was backstabbed by our ever-so-epal classmate, danielle. someone, more like some peole spilled out her secrets. secrets like how she curses mrs. franco behind her back. like those secrets of hers about having someone else do the work for her. man, i've seen her on the verge of tears a lot but seeing her in tears now is simply shocking. mrs. franco is a strong person so i find it bothering.  well, i felt guilty afterwards..about ms. dela pe√±a.i've always been talking behind her back but who could blame me and the other fifty students doing the same thing? i'll do it anyway so i don't have to be sorry. she deserves it anyway.
