urlLink Amazing Cheap Books  I have been on a huge Amazon binge lately as I have been buying a lot of new Dungeons and Dragons books from them.  I also got several seasons worth of Buffy DVDs from them as well.  I decided to try another store today.  It is called  Amazing Cheap Books.  If the service sucks, I will let you know.  The prices were OK.  Amazon.com is like the Walmart of bookstores.  It is hard to compete with them.  Giving new guys a chance every now and then is the American way I think.
