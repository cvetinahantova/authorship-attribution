dude, so it snowed enough with the risk of sleet that i woke up on time, but stayed here and wrote up algebra all morning instead of making it to church... first i've been awake and outright skipped in months... kinda wish i woulda gone, but i really didn't want to deal w/ the crazy snow/sleet traffic, whatever.  turned on the TV during breakfast to see the news about saddam -- craziness indeed... amanda and me actually watched bush's 5 minute speech at noon together... i think that's the first TV we've watched together all semester... or close to it... go figure.  since then i've spent 5 hours on one analysis problem and just now solved it.  headache indeed.  this class drives me nuts.  i really want to pass, i really want to understand, but it frazzles me no end.  earlier... me: so i think i've come to the conclusion that there's not enough time in the days between now and wednesday to finish this exam eric: yeah, i think there's not enough brain cells in my head to finish it... good work.  on the other hand, listening to my spiffy new billy joel double CD i picked up while out w/ jessica yesterday:  lyrics i am the entertainer and i know just where i stand another serenader and another long-haired band today i am your champion, i may have won your hearts but i know the game, you'll forget my name and i won't be here in another year if i don't stay on the charts
