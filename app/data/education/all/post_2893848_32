Last night, Alastair and I watched "Grease," which is on TV basically every day on one channel or another, on the Women's Entertainment Network, AKA "We." The little animation that came up before and after commercial breaks referred to the showing of the film as "Cinematherapy."  This set me off on a little rant about how insipid and unfeminist and annoying the current women's self-help / psychobabble / Oprahfied /Bridget Jones pop culture is, and how infantilizing I find it to constantly be told to "go girl!" and "get self-actualized" (what does that  mean ?) and eat ice cream and burn scented candles when I'm feeling victimized by men/work/my weight/etc. (As for personality quizzes, don't even get me started...)  So then there was a commercial for a show called "Bridezillas" which seems to be about bitchy real-life brides who throw tantrums when the cocktail napkins for their reception are the wrong shade of Ecru, thus ruining the wedding they've dreamed of all their lives. (Jane rants some more, while patient, long-suffering Alastair goes and gets another beer.)  But this was the best part: the voice over said, "That's tomorrow night, on WE."  On We.  On We.  On We.  Say it three times fast....YES. Exactly. Coincidence? I think not.  I rest my case.
