It's been a loong weekend.. Went to Morris yesterday. Made some cookies for my boy before i went (of course). I hung out there at the house for awhile and then Chris and i got rid of all the kids.. went to his house.. and ya know.. hehe. no not really lol. we ran into town and headed back over to my aunt's. I made dinner for the 2 of us and he left around midnight. i'm a little concerned with the cooking thing.. i've made him breakfast.. dinner.. and cookies.. and this is only week 2 of the relationship.. this is not the normal gf thing when it comes to me.. i don't know what's gotten into me. and i'm enjoying it! that's the part that worries me. i really like this one guys. and i just hope he feels the same way about me. i'm really really scared. this is probably something i shouldn't talk about on here but oh well. i just don't know what to do ya know? i know he likes me and we get along awesome. we argued a little yesterday but it was all in good fun. it was over who was gonna make dinner and i was grinin' the whole time.. i think he thought i was mad but i was annoyed at the oil for not heatin' up quicker and i needed to have some girl time with the phone and he and Nate wouldn't get out! lol.   why is it that boys drive me absolutely insane.. all of 'em.. and for some reason i want them around lol. there's one in particular that i want around a lot more often..   all i have to say now is.. trampoline.. hehe..
