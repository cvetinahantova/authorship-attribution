Great news!  I discovered the perfect book to write.  No really, this one is perfect.  So I told Lynn.  LYNN: That's great, honey.  I'm going for a walk down to the souvenier shops.  ANDREW: Fine. Be dismissive, but I'll maybe, probably have it halfway done by the time you get back from your walk.   LYNN: Really.  That's great. Really.   *portions of the previous dialogue may have been vaguely fictionalized to sustain the greater truth of the interaction.   (yes, i mean *my* truth.)
