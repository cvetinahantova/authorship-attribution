Musical Underdogs   This time I'll be brief. I just wanted to list some bands that I haven't mentioned often enough, even though they are just as great as those that I mentioned as my favorites a few days ago.  The top of this rank is taken by  Helloween . So, which songs do I recommend? All of them. Helloween is the Swiss army chainsaw of music. Following we have  Divididos ,  Sumo ,  Rata Blanca , and  Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota . All of them are great rock bands in Argentina, but they're nearly unknown outside of it. They got good stuff.  My friends know that I'm a sucker for  Blackmore's Night , so no need to talk about that.   Edguy ... Very similar in Style to  Bruce Dickinson . Moonspell .  Poisonblack . And I'm too tired to keep counting. Plus I said it'd be brief. So there.
