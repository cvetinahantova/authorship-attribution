Well really I only saw one dead person and that would be Uncle Ho.  Yeah I hit up the masoleum of Ho Chi Minh today.  Very interesting I must say.  Looks like he does in all he pictures, which is good I guess.  I managed to get Gyeh-son without a hitch yesterday which was great.  It's so good to have some company.  I can't blog long since she's wait.  The guy told us there was Korean on the computers but I guess not.   It's so funny, today we ran into so many Korean tourist.  I was at the aiport yesterday and all kinds of organized tours were starting.  I have to say Koreans a possibly the worst tourists ever.  They have no clue what's going on and can't seem to follow and rules or get anything done.  I debate if they should be allowed to leave Korea.  Today we were walking near on of the tours and one of the Korean men on the tour asked who was Ho Chi Minh and why is he so popular.  This is after they went to see him also.  Now mind you this guy wasn't 12 or 13 but well over 50.  Good Lord.  Also while in the tomb the guards had to bark at a group of them continued to talk after they had been told not to.  To sum it all up there was group of girls at the bank who couldn't seem to figure out how to change money or what the exchange rate was.  I wish I could explain how easy this was.  Kevin was right when the told me to aviod them at all costs.  My personal favorite is how they refer to everyone else (including Vietnamese) as foriegners.  Oh man.  I think those of you who live and or lived in Korea can understand.  I've told Gyeh-son her job should be to help them out.   I did lots more but she's waiting so I shouldn't be blogging.  Until next time.
