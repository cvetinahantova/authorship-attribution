Just had a call about my bike (its currently up for sale to clear the finance). A chap from Worcester who is interested but has no way of getting over to me, as the person who is giving him a lift won't come this far out (50 miles). For some stupid reason, I said I would take the bike over to him to see it, so I now have a 2-3 hour ride ahead of me and its due to rain. Need to organise kids "babysitting" too.
