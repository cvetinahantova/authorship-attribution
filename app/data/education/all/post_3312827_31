Not that I went anywhere, but I just haven't posted in a while.  So, let's see... what's new with me?  I started graduate courses again, and it's proving to be a lot of work.  School is almost done.  I have no money.  Julie moved out because she doesn't have enough room (anyone need a roommate?)  I don't have a boyfriend, but I want one.  Someone that used to go out with an ex-friend IMed me out of the blue because he remembered me.  How random is that?  I got carded at a work party yesterday and was extremely embarassed.  I'm insanely jealous of Rebecca's relationship with Gene, even though I know the green-eyed monster is not something that you should let into your life when it comes to your friends.  I'll be divorced two weeks from Monday.  And that's about it.
