The trip went fantastic; I will have some photos up at some point. The girls met their great grandmother/grandfather and all their aunts, uncles, and cousins that they have yet to meet. Needless to say they were spoiled rotten by it all.  The trip was long though, coming back was very tough. After my arrival in Ottawa it took a heck of allot of willpower to try and leave after 4 days. I so miss that city and the people there.  Well, I also managed to get a few interviews in and passed off quite a few resumes to different companies.  I have 3 phone interviews lined up, and a Job offer to consider. I will weigh all of my options before I decide what I will be doing, but leaving NB is definitely a priority for me.  More later.  RLB
