Do not attempt to adjust your screen, I have taken control of the internet...well...at least this blog...temporarily, of course...or I've posted something by the way... Ever leave a message on an answering machine but you weren't sure why you were calling in the first place?......and it just ends up being you rambling into a listening phone?...Yeah, I do that alot...like right now...I have no idea what I'm writing but I'm writing nonetheless...Ok, I love you baby, talk to you tomorra'
