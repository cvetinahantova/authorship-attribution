Happy birthday to us! Happy birthday to us! ----It's our 8th year anniv today!!! Quite long... :p.   Where's Myk? It's almost 5pm.He's not late. He said we'll visit his dad first in the hospital. He's been confined for about 2 weeks now... gallstones and an inflamed pacreas. Was transfered from medical City, Pasig to Makati Med the other day. Doctor says he's okay.   I'm getting hungry... Myk said we'll leave when the food for his parents arrives...finally. Off to Mandarin Oriental for dinner.  Thanks to Myk's sister, we have 2 thousand worth of gift certificate. Hmmm...which restaurant? Ah..The Tivoli. Fine Dining. Myk ordered the Ostrich, I ordered pasta (my favorite)..3 hours later,we're really full and sleepy. Hehehhe.  It's been a busy day. Tired yet happy... 8 years is no joke.
