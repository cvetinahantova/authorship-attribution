For the second time in a little over a year, I was alone at my house yesterday.  The husband took the baby and the dogs to the grandparents house and I was blissfully alone.  You need to understand that I love the above mentioned husband, baby and even dogs.  However, I have always been a person who needs more alone time than most.  In fact when my husband and I were dating, Wednesday was "Alone Night".  We would stay at our seperate apartments by  ourselves.  In the space of one afternoon I was able to:  ~Make a trip to Old Navy to purchase some new spring clothes. ~Stop by Target to pick up some shoes to go with said clothes. ~Clean the entire house, including the master bathroom (including the gross shower floor). ~Make dinner, eat dinner and clean up from dinner in a consecutive fashion. ~Do my nails. ~Watch "The Big Chill" on AMC (favorite line: "Nobody ever said it was going to be fun.  At least, nobody ever said it to me...")  Amazing what I can accomplish when my attention is not split in 7 different directions at once.
