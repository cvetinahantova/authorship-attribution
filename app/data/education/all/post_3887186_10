I got some problem in linking one to another paragraph without discernible bumps,gaps or shifts.If I let the problem occur continously my sentences and paragraphs will not flow smoothly.So.. how am I to improve this skill?         After talking and discussing to some of my friends and doing some reading,I get to know some of the techniques...First rule, a topic sentence should tell readers whether the information they are about to read supports the thesis statement directly or supports a key idea in the essay which in turn support the thesis.Second rule,reprtition of key words is an important techniques for gaining coherence because if too much information seems new, a paragraph will be hard to read.To prevent repetitions from becoming dull we can use variations of a key word.         From those two rules, I'll try to connect my ideas briallantly especially in order to bind together text that looks too choppy.Another point that I must remember is by using certains words and phrases signal connections between ideas. For instance, to show addition; further,furthermore and moreover can be used AND if to indicate logical relationship, we can use therefore,consequently,thus or as a result. I will remember all those things to help me in writing my position as well as my research paper....
