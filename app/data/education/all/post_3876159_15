Ok, so I have to read this intense text book, keep a journal, and start reading another book besides studing all the grammer that I learned in Jr. High, but of course, have forgotton. This intense text book is so over my head. Now, I have read a lot ...a lot..of books in my day and this one is by far the hardest thing I have ever read. I have read two chapters thus far and am not really sure what it said. I basically have to use a stupid dictionary just to read it. The book is about research and statistics and that is great and all, but the author debates different methodologies...common ...just get to findings or even the point.    I don't like a lot of fluff..just give it to me straight.   I am so glad today is Friday! I love Fridays for the sake of being Friday. I really wanted to go see that Anchorman movie tonight but it doesn't look like it is going to pan out. :( I just have to make sure and catch it before I leave.   Here is the list of things I have to do before I leave: 1. Winston the Chinchilla 2. Read boring text 3. Read other boring text 4. Review my grammer (Who knew I would really use that stuff) 5. Sell Car 6. Get insurance 7. Get out of Rent contract (This may be taken care of already) 8. Plane ticket 9. Get money to pay for plane ticket 10. Get loan diferred (at least file under another category so I don't have to pay interest) 11. Gargage Sell 12. Sell Computer 13. Apply for Visa 14. Learning Italian may be of some significance.  I know all this is so very interesting but I don't really care. It is interesting to me.
