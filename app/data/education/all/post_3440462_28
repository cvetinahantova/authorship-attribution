Today the near miraculous happened, I enrolled for classes this fall at PSU.  Praise be to God (and, by the way Lord, I'm not sure how this is getting payed for yet...).  So, you might ask (actually, you didn't so I asked for you) what am I taking?  PHL324 Intro to Formal Logic ENG490U Rhetoric ENG308U Top:  Literature and the Enviroment ENG340U Medieval Literature  BTW I have declared "Liberal Studies" as my major, which is a short-hand way of saying that I get to take pretty much what I want to take.  And there was much rejoicing.
