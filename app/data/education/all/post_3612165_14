One of the best ways to sound like a foreigner to an American is to fully pronounce everything the way it's written (the formal, textbook pronunciations).  However, learning this list of contractions used in daily speech is an extremely good way to sound like a veteran (person with experience) in English, and is helpful when trying to understand other people.  When trying to blend in, it is absolutely indispensable.  If you have trouble remembering the things on this list, don't worry about it.  These are just general ideas.  They are speech patterns that people often use when speaking and you will hear them all the time.  No one will ever think that you're speaking incorrectly even if you don't read what I have here, but you will speak and understand better if you do read it.   Go to the Spoken American English forum (discussion area). Ask questions and have them answered by other people on the forum.           (The ^ sound is the "schwa" vowel as in given = giv^n.)          (The | sound is the "glottal stop ".  See note at bottom of page.)          (The ~n sound is what I call a "nasal stop".  I have not heard any other name for this sound.  See note at bottom of                page)             ****Click on any of the links below in order to play the sound file****        Sound  (Standard sound) Pronunciation  (Standard sound is replaced with this) Example  with Sound Sample Comments  1.  -t-  -d-  later = lad^r   better =  bedd^r   smarter =  smard^r   at a time = add^ time   a tomato = ^t^mado   mandatory =  mand^tory   the way to go =  th^ way d^ go Extremely common.  This is always used in the US except in very formal speaking, but never noted in written text.  Used when a "t" is between vowels and the "t" begins an unaccented syllable.  (vowel + r  is considered a vowel here).  Generally not used when a "t" begins a word or starts a (heavily or lightly) accented syllable.  An exception to this is the word "to".  2.  -ing   -^n I'm walking all the way back tonight. =   I'm walk^n all th^ way back t^nigh|. (see Rule 5) This is actually more casual, but still extremely common.  It is often not noted in writing, but if it is, it is spelled "-in'".  This is usually only used in verbs that end in "-ing".  It can also be found in words like "nothing" and "something", but not "everything" or "anything."  3.  -t^n, -nt  -|n, -n|  mountain = moun|^n   forgotten = f^rgo|^n   can't =can|   (different from "can")   paint = pain|   waiting = wait|n (See Rule 2) Extremely common.  This is always used in the US except when speaking formally or clearly.  Americans do this without even being aware of it, but to avoid this "glottal stop" sounds very stilted.  Used at ends of words.  4.  -nt-  -n-  twenty = twenny   center = cenn^r   printer = prinn^r   into = into   onto = onto This is used when "nt" is between vowels and the second vowel is unstressed.  It is always used except when speaking clearly.  The "t"-sound is actually pronounced very lightly, almost inaudibly (cannot be heard).  Not used for "into" nor "onto".  5.  -t  -| or -|t  sweet = swee|   late =lay|   lights = ligh|ts   output = ou|pu|   forget it = f^rgedd ^|          (See Rule 1)   recited =r^cid^d Extremely common and always used except when trying to speak clearly.  Never written.  Often the "t" may be also pronounced or lightly pronounced.  Not used before a vowel.  (See Rule 1:  "-t-" )  6.  -k  -|k  break = brea|k   strike = stri|ke   works = w^r|ks   break it = break ^t   awaken = ^wak^n Extremely common and often used except when speaking very clearly.  Never written.  The glottal stop is spoken right with the "k" with the "k" pronounced lightly.  This causes the works "light" and "like" to sound very similar in the US.  Generally only at the end of a word and never before a vowel.  7.  -b, -d,    -g, -p  -|b, -|d,   -|g, -|p  lab =la|b   red = re|d   bag = ba|g   wipe = wi|pe This is always done in American speech except when speaking clearly or emphatically.  The final consonant is pronounced lightly after a glottal stop.  The mouth ends in that position without pronouncing the consonant fully.  8.  -d^n    golden = gol~n   wouldn't = woul~n|   shouldn't = shoul~n|   reading = rea~n   ( I'm rea~n a book.)               (See Rule 2)  Note that combining Rule 8 with Rule 2 is used in more casual speech. This is the "nasal stop" described below.  It is always used except when speaking clearly.  If this sound is difficult, don't worry about it, but you will hear it used.   9.  them  ^m I heard ^m yesterday. Used in more casual speech but extremely common.  Either written " 'em" or "them".  Can be confused with "^m" (him).  (See Rule 10)  10.  him, her   his, he  ^m, ^r, ^z, ee I gave ^m the message.  I have ^r books.  I have ^z books.  Maybe ee forgot.  Her books. Extremely common but rarely written.  Never used at the beginning of a sentence or phrase.  11.  "of"  ^ or ^v  a bunch of stuff =  ^ bunch^ stuff.  ^ bunch ^v stuff More casual but extremely common.  Either written "o' " or "of".  12.  "and'  ^n fish ^n chips  I came ^n I left. More casual but extremely common.  Either written " 'n" or "and".  13.  "you",   "you'd"  y^, y^d How are y^?  I saw y^ the other day.  Y^d haft^ [have to] be crazy. This is rather casual but very common.  It is written "ya", "ya' ", or "you".  14.  -t + "you",    -t + "your"  -tchew or -tch^,   -tch^r  I got you a magazine. =   I gotchew a magazine. or  I gotch^ a magazine.  Get your book off the table = Getch^r book off the table. This is commonly heard in all levels (classes) of speech, but not all of the time.  Also see Rules 5 and 13 above.   15.  -d + "you",   -d + "your"  -djew or -dj^,   -dj^r  I made you a sandwich. =   I madejew a sandwich. or   I madej^ a sandwich.  I read your book. =   I redj^r book. This is commonly heard in all levels (classes) of speech, but not all of the time.  Also see Rules 7 and 13 above.  16.  "going to"  gunn^ or g^n^ I'm g^n^ leave.  He's g^n^ stay.   I'm going to the movies. =  I'm goin' to the movies. This is more casual but extremely common.  Usually written "gonna" or sometimes "going to."  Only used if "going to" + verb.  17.  "want to"  wann^ I wann^ leave.  They wann^ stay. This is more casual but extremely common.  Usually written "want to" or sometimes "wanna."  18.  "because"  "kuz" or "k^z"  "because it's important" =   "kuz it's impor|^n|"   "k^z it's impor|^n|"          (See Rules 3 and 5) This is used in more casual speech, but is very commonly heard.  19.  Omitting  pronouns  "You want to see a movie?" =  "Wann^ see a movie?"   "I hope you do well." =   "Hope you do well." This is done when the pronoun is already implied.  Only use this after gaining some experience in English.  20. The word "you" is often used used not to specifically mean "you" but to mean "someone",  "everyone", or "anyone" in a general sense.  "It is not necessary to be a genius to figure that out." = "You don't have to be a genius to figure that out."  "No one ever knows what can happen." = "You never know what can happen."  "Someone can find whatever he/she wants in New York."  You can find whatever you want in New York." This is used when the the word "you" is unstressed.  This is used in all types of conversations and often in writing.  However, it is discouraged in formal writing.  Rule 13 may also be used.   There are a lot of monosyllabic (one syllable) words whose vowels simply become "schwas" when they are not emphasized and used in more casual speech.  They include:    when, as, it, well, then, let's, at, to, in, if. . . .   The "glottal stop", represented here with a "|", is like a rapid stop in the throat, like rapidly turning your voice off and back on again.  It is similar to the hamza sound in Arabic represented with a " ' " as in mi'a (one hundred.)  It's also the sound you hear if you've ever heard an American say "uh-oh" or "uh-uh".   The "nasal stop" is something that is very rare in languages of the world.  I do not know of any language besides English that has this sound in it.  It is like the glottal stop, but this time the stop is in the nose.  Try to pronounce the "d" sound or the "g" sound completely inside the nose. Here is the sound pronounced slowly.   Also, check out (examine) this website here: Language Miniature No. 71.  This article is called "How we think we talk and how we really talk," and it provides a lot of information and observations about the spoken American language--similar to this website.  Highly recommended.  But note: even though the main title of the artice is "Jeet Jet?", it would be extremely unrealistic that anyone would ever say "Jeet jet?" instead of "Did you eat yet?".  On the other hand, using the rules on this website above (Numbers 5 and 15), it would be very realistic for someone to say, "Didj^ ee| ye|?"   Another great website I just discovered can be found here: Relaxed Pronunciation.  It has much of the information that this website has and a few other details about pronunciation.
