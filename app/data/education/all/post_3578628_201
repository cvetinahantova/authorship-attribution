I can't hide my feelings on life.  There are some things that I just feel people should know.  One thing happened today that bothers me and I just want to issue a friendly reminder to people.  If you say you're gonna do something, you should go through with it.  And after you carry it out, you shouldn't go back on what you've done.  For instance, if you're against gay marriage that's alright.  But once you allow gay ppl to marry you can't take away their marriage.  If you don't know, about 4,000 people's marriages were taken away.  These people's lives have just changed dramatically for the worse.  All because a simple gift was taken away from them.    People think a "mistake" was fixed but you can't do this to people.  If it's a "mistake" then don't let it happen again
