Tonight's a bad night. I can tell because I am never ever up this late, and I don't have a burning desire to go to bed.  Tonight's a bad night. I can tell because I got into fights with not one but two Heathers.  Tonight's a bad night. I can tell because I wish there was someone I could call and talk to but there's nobody  Nobody to call at midnight, or 3 in the morning, depending on what part of the world you find yourself in.  That used to be my mark of a good friendship. And maybe it still is. I just don't have one.  Tonight's a bad night. I can tell because the waterfall of tears that has been welling up for months has finally broke loose. The cascade runs down my nose.  And nobody knows it's time to call. Nobody knows, and everyone sleeps. Lately I've felt closest to people far away.  I don't want to be oversensitive. I just want someone to care. Someone who invites me to go rockclimbing when the whole big group is going rockclimbing because they know I love rockclimbing.  Someone who tells me that seeing me takes some energy because I'm not a frog on a log. Someone who tells me that when they're exhausted they'll go to bed, not that they don't want to make plans then have to cancel them.   dinner at home and a rented video doesn't require any energy, especially if you were coming here. it also means that if i get really exhausted i wouldn't have to be stressed out about breaking plans with other people   How do you think that makes me feel? How does it make me feel that L, M, and C plan to go to Planet Granite so they can hang out with H? "Give them a break, they're trying to be friends with both of us! They hung out with you last weekend, they want to hang out with me this weekend!" Is there a reason we can't all hang out together?  CC seems to control the game. I'm not sure I like that about her.
