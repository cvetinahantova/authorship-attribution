urlLink Astrocartography of Richard Nixon's Least-aspected Uranus   Biography of the President, with special focus on how the planetary symbols of Uranus and Moon were reflected in his life and work, by astrocartographer Rob Couteau. This may be bunk but it is interesting.  From the site:  Richard Nixon’s astrocartography contains a unique example of how the key symbols con­tained within the Transcendental Midpoint-Field are reflected in mundane historic events.  As we can see in Nixon’s astrocartography, his Primary Uranus, Secondary Moon, and Tertiary Saturn form an N-shaped Transcendental Midpoint-Field directly over eastern China, extending from the South China Sea to the northernmost tip of the nation. His Ter­tiary Saturn (forming the diagonal line in this field) passes directly over Beijing and curves along the northeast coast. Within this field the thirty-seventh American president enacted his most “long lasting and significant accomplishment” (Tertiary Saturn). His his­toric voyage to Beijing in February 1972 paved the way toward a “normalization of rela­tions” (Secondary Moon) between the Communist mainland and the United States, an act of such “innovation” (Primary Uranus) that it was considered politically “unthinkable” (Uranus) until that time.          Richard Nixon was born at Yorba Linda, California, at a considerable distance from any planetary lines. He completed Whittier College in 1934 and after graduating from Duke University Law School in North Carolina he practiced law, then joined the Navy in August 1942. During his first assignment he served as a naval passenger officer in the New Hebrides (16S00; 167E00) in the South Pacific. While en route there he passed through the first of his Primary Uranus / Secondary Moon / Tertiary Saturn Transcendental Midpoint-Fields, this one positioned diagonally over the Pacific, covering an area extend­ing from the Hawaiian Islands to French Polynesia (15S00; 140W00).          After the war Nixon decided to enter the political arena and in 1946 ran a successful — but even by contemporary political standards, an extremely dirty — campaign against Congressional incumbent Jerry Voorhis. His election to Congress and his subsequent move to Capitol Hill placed him near the vertical, apparent midnight position of his Pri­mary Uranus line, which runs along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Shortly after his election he was appointed to the so-called House Un-American Activities Com­mittee (HUAC) and, according to Nixon biographer Anthony Summer, was fed inside information by the CIA (through Allen Dulles) that supposedly implicated Alger Hiss as a Soviet spy. Nixon’s involvement with HUAC and the Hiss case (which came to trial in 1949) brought him to national prominence. After continuing to build his power base within the Republican Party, he was elected as Senator in 1950 and was selected as vice-president and served under Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1960.
