I love tax time.  i get over 500 bucks back.  Beat that.  I'm gonna be rich.   Baja.  Soon.  First Week of April, come soon!  I think I might go to central america for a month this summer even if i don't have the money.  I just really want to go.  I need an extended wandering trip.  I'm planning on going with frank.  i believe he'd be a good travel partner.  It remains to be seen whether he's good enough to punch in the face though.  (Side note, I've punched two of my good friends in the face, one while traveling in Croatia ["watch out.  the wine is fiunny there.]).  Anyhow, I think that trip will do me good.  I've applied/sent resumes to teach at a private school next year.  I've hit up a luck number 13 different schools.  It's a even mix between high school and elementary/jr high.  We'll see.  I need some money coming in to fund my overseas adventures.  I'd rather spend thousands of dollars traveling every year than on a new Ford Taurus or whatever the heck people do with their money.  Because, dude, I am so poor it ain't even funny.  You could combine all the money I've made the past three years and it still wouldn't equal a year's salary at most private schools, which don't pay all that much themselves.  i hate money.  NEXT...        go see "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."  It's ridiculously good.  It killed me with a broadsword.  It's the best movie I've seen in a long time, and that is saying A LOT.  It's the best Charlie Kaufman movie.  I was emotional through the whole thing really.  The directing, artistic and otherwise, is awesome.  Kaufman is such a good writer, he makes me want to run away and live in baja for the rest of my life seeing that he is the standard to which I hold myself.  I was in a daze for a couple days (ha) after seeing this film.  Stunning, mind-blowing, skillfully made, thought-provoking, trippy, artsy-fartsy, intense...I'm moved just thinking about the film now.   Shoot.
