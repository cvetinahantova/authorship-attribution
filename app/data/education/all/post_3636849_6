my little sister got married last weekend.  It is weird  and  precarious, the act of giving away a loved one.  She used to be this bothersome thorn in my side, and at some point in time she morphed into a beautiful woman.    She danced with me....that is historic, considering this is the girl who was traumatized when I put my arm around her in the hallway of the high school.  __________________________________    The political climate of our country is polarized, jumpy, and fragile....quite possibly the first time since reconstruction all three of those adjectives could be used simultaneously.  __________________________________    playlist for 7/26 Thornley - Come Again lostprophets - burn burn The Cowsills - I love the flowergirl Casino versus Japan - Metrobolt
