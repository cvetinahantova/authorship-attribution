i just realized what's been missing from this site thus far:   many of you already know it, but i have to say it in a public way (maybe even in a monthly way so that its on *each* of my blog pages):   i have a deep suspicion that drop - ceilings are to blame for everything.    1. whoever came up with the idea to make a space more -- whatever -- (intimate? cramped?) by eliminating our headspace -- well if i weren't a just-war pacifist (note my evolution), i'd say they should be shot.  2. i'm quite sure that there are multiple implicit effects stemming from this -- not the least of which is the stilting of the human imagination.
