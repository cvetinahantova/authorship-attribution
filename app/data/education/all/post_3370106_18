Nobody could ever really care as much about this as me.  It's really just an outlet to remind me as often as possible that I am fallible and capable of sabatoging my best efforts.  It is an opportunity to come to terms with the mental battle I have sometimes between doing what is right and what feels good.  Ultimately, I know that what feels best is to be in the warm and loving embrace of the eternal light-force-energy that is all pervading.    It will be my daily goal to remain in conscious contact with that force, to actively seek that power, to allow it to manifest through my daily living in all the choices I make.  Everything I do should be infused with the vibration of Aum.  Though parts of my mind still tell me to resist, still tell me that I can't possibly follow the path with all my heart, I know that I must.  So, I recommit daily and ask that my steps be guided by that commitment to God, to the great masters and to all my fellow humans struggling to make sense of this illusion.
