#1 is fourteen years old and as they say, I'm not sure he's going to make it to fifteen.  One minute he is depressed for whatever reason, the next minute he thinks he is God's gift to the "ladies."  He argues with his mother, his brother, and me.  He starts "going out" with a girl and two weeks later he breaks up with her.  Working hard for something was always his way of doing things until lately.  Now, if his mother and I would let him, he spends all of his time on the computer.  Yes, we do have time limits set.  I'm hoping this is his early teen phase and will outgrow it.  SOON, I hope!  Love him, just don't always like him.
