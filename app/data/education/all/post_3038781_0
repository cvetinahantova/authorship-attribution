Aside from it being Latoya's breast, why do you think a peek of it remains a "tempest in a c-cup" [Matt Lauer,  Today Show  , Today.] ?   What is  it  about a women's breast that so many find obscene?  They can't be inherently obscene or you would have to think that God was a bit of a voyeur. In fact, if I remember right one of the first signs of sin was that Adam and Eve covered up.   Supposedly breasts are covered up because they're sexual organs; but, to my memory neither men's nor women's breasts are essential to sex... only just one of  the perks.   I'll admit that it plays a part in rearing the offspring, but that doesn't seem to be the issue because most places don't consider nursing an obscene act.  If it's not the function, then what is it? The size? The shape? No, otherwise sumo wrestlers and heavy guys etc couldn't go topless but flat chested women could... so it comes back down to the obvious...   They're obscene because the certain people (who shall remain nameless) think of them in conjunction with obscene acts... My, my such dirty minds...   Now, I won't say who they are; but, next time you hear someone complaining about Latoya's or any other set being obscene -- you'll know who I'm talking about.
