I was talking with a friend about the whole concept of blogging last night, and he brought up several interesting points.  One being that blogging is somewhat self-absorbed, and they other being why not just keep a journal.  I've done a lot of thinking, and I agree that blogging is pretty self-absorbed.  The whole idea is to post your innermost thoughts and opinions and let other people read it.  As for the whole journal issue, I've been a would-be journaler for years.  I just can't seem to get into writing my thoughts into a little book.  It seems such a waste of time to write to myself what I could just think to myself.  Thus, the interest in blogging.  I'll freely admit that the voyueristic quality of a blog lends a certain appeal to me.  I much more enjoy writing all this junk in my head when there is a chance that someone might read it.  It's not even so much that I want to spread my opinion, rather there is some comfort in the fact that the thoughts screaming in my head my find a small amout of validation in the world.  It's almost as if, if I just think the thoughts they have less meaning than if there is the possibility that the thoughts will be discovered.  Does this even make any sense?  I dunno, but it's my blog and I'll write whatever I want! :)
