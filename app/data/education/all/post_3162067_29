Well, I bit the bullet and got my hair cut. I must say that I love it very much: it's a fashionable style and it looks great when it's straightened. However, as I discovered this morning before work, it's a pig to straighten. Luckily I still managed to get it looking good and I had many many compliments at work today. Which was nice. I saw the osteopath this afternoon: I have to go back on Friday. He says my ligaments are very inflamed, which is effectively making my spine stick together. Luckily, it's unlikely to be a long-term condition and it can be treated. He's surprised I put up with it for so long. So am I. Unfortunately, I had to have a pin stuck in my bottom for him to come to this conclusion. Have some school work to do and some emails to write, so will sign off now. G'night.
