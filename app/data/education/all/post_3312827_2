I felt like something was up today at school.  When I was done and in my car, I turned on my cell and sure enough there were 3 texts from him.  They said that he couldn't make it today.  His brother got jumped last night and was in the hospital.  I talked to him briefly tonight and he said that he didn't think anyone was going to get charged... and that no one was going to sue.  That frustrated me a little bit...  these assholes are not going to pay for what they did.  He's thinking about taking the vigilante route, but if he does that, he runs the risk of ruining his future teaching career.  I don't want him to do that.  Anyway... so here I sit at 8:45 on a Friday night with nothing to do.  I guess I'll have to go find something.
