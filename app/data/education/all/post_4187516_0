urlLink Chicago Tribune Swiftboat skipper Kerry critics wrong   What else is it going to take to diffuse the false allegations made by the opportunist Swift Boat Veterans for Truth? Here is an account of the events in Vietnam these men question as told by William B. Rood, an editor for the Chicago Tribune, who was a swift boat commander on the same mission where Senator Kerry's actions earned him a Silver Star. Mr. Rood   fully debunks   the SBVT's claims and  between his account ,  the account's from the men who were on Senator Kerry's boat ,  and   Navy records  it is crystal clear that the SBVT is nothing more than   a sleazy smear group   bent on nothing more than clouding the issues landscape to keep voters' focus away from the Bush Administration's failed tenure in office.  Click on over to the Chicago Tribune to read the full account. You'll have to register with them, however it's free.  If SBVT is so interested in the TRUTH, maybe they should focus their efforts on finding out where President Bush was during 1972/73 while he was supposed to be serving in the National Guard in Alabama.
