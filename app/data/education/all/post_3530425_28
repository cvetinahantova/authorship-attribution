Again, I must remark on the photos men include with their profiles.  Today's email loser, a CPA from about 50 miles up the highway. Either a comb-over or a bad toupe.  Why, oh why aren't the hotties responding to me?  His photo was so bad, I laughed out loud, the loudest, most sincere laugh I've laughed in days.
