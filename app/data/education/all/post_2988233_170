Today is my dad's 84th birthday.  Wow.    I am making him and my mom supper, and baking his cake, and all that general stuff.  We are having Chicken Fried steak with gravy, biscuits, mashed potatoes, green beanas and whatever else I decide to fix.  Just for the record, I am one of those cook from scratch people.  Especially when it comes to the menu tonight.    I have had one of those strange kinds of days.  I clean hubby's work twice amonth.   Today, they hit a new low for nastiness is the potty.  Seriously, how some of you male readers, please tell me, how do you get poop on the bottom of the urinal, and on the wall beside the urinal, and not on the wall beside the toilet???????????  I jsut don't understand.  I told Tommy it was a new low, that for the first time in my life, I gagged.    Now I used to work in a restaurant downtown that various vagrants would use our facilities to clean up of a morning.  They were much cleaner than what I cleaned up today.  Much, much cleaner.    I just don't understand.
