no title yet...just an idea.   "What is life? What does it mean to live in a world of terony?" This thought,these questions often crossed Lara's mind. She never answered. She would sit in class doodleing in her blue cheap notebook she got on her birthday a year or so ago. She would never use it for school. Only to doodle and write. Her dreams...her ideas....her stories. this little notebook with the blue cover and the chocolate stain in the bottom left corner. Such a little thing could mean so much to her. Life lessons passed over her brown haired head. Some might say she is  bit of an air head. But Lara was about to learn the lesson that would change her forever.  It all started.....    " LARA!!!God lara get ....whew...over here...."  Cassie stoped at mid step catching her breath chasing after Lara. Lara turned in a cool fashion and offered Cassie a hand up. "Whats so important that you have to chase me down 8 blocks?" Lara had a soft yet errogant voice. Most everything she said sounded like she was being mouthy, but cassie knew better then to say something. "Well...oh man....ugh...hold on I need to catch my breath...oh..ok much better." Cassie grined and begain to explain everything. " ok ok ok hold on a minute. A new boy moved here a day or so ago and he looks like the boy I know from the pictures in my scrap book from when I lived in Alaska? Cassie...might I sedgest you get some help." Cassie looked at lara with a sour look and continued to babble. As they rounded the corner to Cassie's house Lara stoped dead in her tracks. Something had caught her eye. Something so dear to her she had almost forgoten how dear it was...her promise. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Well thats alittle tid bit.
