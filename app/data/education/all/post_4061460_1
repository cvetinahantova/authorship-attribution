I got quite a bit done today. I put enough content (including a message board) on my web site that I feel it is worth looking at. I picked up a textbook for my Freshman class that I am pleased with. I even got in all of my Bible study. I need to get serious on my syllabi pretty soon.  The kids and I had an opportunity to go out to lunch with Cindy today. All of us really enjoy that. Too bad we don't have more opportunites to do so.
