It probably doesn't take a PhD in dream analysis to interpret the separation anxiety in the dream I am about to relate.  I was in the Uiowa Hopsital when ER style chaos broke out.  All sorts of EMTs raced into the building  with full stretchers.  Then hospital people in blue garb started falling in the operation rooms and corridors.  They moaned theatrically in their dying.  The loudspeaker announced (helpfully) that we should all run for our lives because a virulent case of FATAL strep was on the loose.  Naturally, I ran.  Sadly as I ran, I passed many of my friends from the workshop who were in the process of succumbing to this very virulent strep.  Sucks to be you.  I won't name names other than to say that Chang (sorry Chang) was the first to go -- which makes a kind of pleasing symmetry to my experience here at the workshop but only in a perverse kind of way.  Rest assured that if you're on this blog you were a goner.  In any event, I survived the plague quite nicely thank you, and the next segment of the dream took place in the motherland where milk and honey were mine for the asking.  My advice for you all:  Run for your lives without looking back.  Iowa City is no longer safe.  Not for any of us!
