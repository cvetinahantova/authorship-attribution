Which I wouldn't have worried about, except for the simple fact that it arrived in the one mailbox that I normally don't get any spam in. So I looked at the headers:   ----------8<-------------- ... Received: from alias.acm.org (alias.acm.org [199.222.69.90])	by pythagoras.math.uwaterloo.ca (8.11.7/8.11.7)  with ESMTP id i1O4Phk09817	for <  cwstromm@cs.uwaterloo.ca  >; Mon, 23 Feb 2004 23:25:43 -0500 (EST) Received: from 199.222.69.90 ([218.12.43.234])        by alias.acm.org (ACM Email Forwarding Service)  with SMTP id COB73880;        Mon, 23 Feb 2004 23:24:48 -0500  Received: from uf4p.f6qgm.com [  161.247.5.51  ] by 199.222.69.90 id <5316049-85852> for <  byrne@acm.org  >;  Tue, 24 Feb 2004 00:24:05 -0400 ----------8<--------------    The first thing that I notice is that it's sent to my e-mail address at the University of Waterloo. That is unusual, because I don't officially use it except to receive mail from my official address. Furthermore, I don't even advertise that address! This again makes me believe that UW's e-mail got opted into mass mailing lists.  Tsk tsk tsk ! Shame on them! Of course I could think sensibly and assume that the address is on  some  page and has just been harvested. But that is only the beginning. A quick  urlLink Google search  for the offending company indicates that there are several such mails, all addressed to a different industry sector. The whole issue reeks of spam.  I also did a little whois on the URL posted at the bottom of the e-mail, and found this:   ----------8<-------------- Domain ID:D103443577-LROR Domain Name:TECHADVICE.ORG Created On:14-Dec-2003 11:01:46 UTC Last Updated On:17-Feb-2004 22:34:40 UTC Expiration Date:14-Dec-2004 11:01:46 UTC Sponsoring Registrar:R91-LROR Status:OK Registrant ID:GODA-04811183 Registrant Name:  Hellen Vo   Registrant Street1:6805 Louise Ave #510 Registrant City:Van Nuys Registrant State/Province:California Registrant Postal Code:91406 Registrant Country:US Registrant Phone:+1.8185718328 Registrant Email:hellenv105@aol.com Admin ID:GODA-24811183 Admin Name:Hellen Vo Admin Street1:6805 Louise Ave #510 Admin City:Van Nuys Admin State/Province:California Admin Postal Code:91406 Admin Country:US Admin Phone:+1.8185718328 Admin Email:  hellenv105@aol.com   Tech ID:GODA-14811183 Tech Name:Hellen Vo Tech Street1:6805 Louise Ave #510 Tech City:Van Nuys Tech State/Province:California Tech Postal Code:91406 Tech Country:US Tech Phone:+1.8185718328 Tech Email:hellenv105@aol.com Name Server:  NS1.SUSPENDED-FOR.SPAM-AND-ABUSE.COM   Name Server:NS2.SUSPENDED-FOR.SPAM-AND-ABUSE.COM ----------8<--------------   But wait, there's more! A search for Hellen Vo produced   urlLink this  . And a search for her e-mail address brought  urlLink this  up. Finally, a reverse whois on the ip from which the mail originated indicates that is comes from  Giant Food Inc . Which looks like a legitimate business, but has nothing to do with computers. Looks like they're being used as a spam relay. Neither does it seem to me that  urlLink Michael Byrne , whom byrne@acm.org seems to belong to, is a person who indulges in spam propagation. Who knows, maybe I should drop him an e-mail?
