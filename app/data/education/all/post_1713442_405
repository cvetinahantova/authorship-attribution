urlLink Scientifically Based Research. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Ron Beghetto.  It looks at the research modle of education based on science.  From the ERIC Digest:  Increasingly, there has been an emphasis on evidence-based practice in education. The most recent incarnation of this focus is "scientifically based research" (SBR), a phrase often associated with the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001.   The NCLB Act, the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) since it was enacted in 1965, redefines the federal role in K-12 education. This legislation stipulates that federally funded programs and practices must be grounded in "scientifically based" research. School leaders who depend on federal funding are now required to be aware of the nature of the research that guides their programs and practices. In particular, federal funding decisions will be determined in part by whether programs and practices have a basis in "scientific research."   The U.S. Department of Education, among others, is developing guidelines to assist school leaders in assessing the scientific basis of programs and practices. Ultimately, the difficult decisions of selecting programs and practices will rely on the professional discretion and expertise of school leaders. This Digest describes the nature and implications of SBR.
