ALL That work...guess it paid off!    Â  I was thinking this on my way up to the Twin Cities today. I had been working on this grad school admissions stuff nonstop since the April of last year. In april of last year I started studying extensively for the GRE. At the same time, I had started research and worked nonstop with research throughout the summer, while at the same time studying each night of the summer. Yet I also taught for one summer session last year. THEN, on top of it all, I took lots of hard hard classes last fall, all together at once, mainly because I had wanted to graduate, but also to show graduate schools that I could handle hard classes. Then I worked sooooo hard to earn good grades in all those, at the same I taught, and was applying to the graduate schools! There were times I wondered if I could handle it any longer, but I kept going. I was always praying that my hard work would pay off and it did. I even told myself towards the end of november and beginning of december that once all was done, I could treat myself to going on a trip to Pakistan. Well the trip was awesome. And Ahhhhh, my work DID pay off. NOT to toot my own horn, but I was realizing this today, as gosh, I was up to my neck with stuff last year around this time...and my main reason for ALL of it was so that I could apply to graduate schools and get into a good one with good financial aid. I guess I did it; maybe I should pat my back now. But heck this is just the BEGINNING, I still have 5 more years to go, before I can say AHHH, and pat my back and be happy about it ALL.So I guess one type of stress ends, but yet another begins....
