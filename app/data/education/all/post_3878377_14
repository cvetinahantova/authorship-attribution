I started doing my log when I arrived in the multi-media room...i begin my saying "It's a great day!" but then well something went wrong with my blog, it does not save what I have written. Better try again. Yesterday (Sunday)I did not log in because I donot own a PC in my place. However, that was a wonderful day, just spending quality time with loved ones. I was with Jorge, we watched Spiderman 2.I did really enjoy, kung di lang sobrang makulit tong si mr. galeria. Sinira pa ang araw ko dahil may MARIA pa siya (ha ha ha, I always say I am never jealous!I am not.) I am too broad-minded now..at secured pa!No big deal for me.  Today I started doing my stuffs as early as possible. Well am helping in the election of the Student council Officers. It is a great day as well..meeting friends and great people around.  I am happy..and grateful!
