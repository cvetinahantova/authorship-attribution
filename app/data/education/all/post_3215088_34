Watched a whole series of J-drama today......freaking funny. Anyone still remember the jap girl with the big ears? Hahaha....nice show...  Other than that....life's boring...dont feel like going out today. Nuah!!!  I've been sitting down dreaming...dreaming about my future. What am i going to be in the future? What can i really be? A bureaucrat? A Teacher? or even an Outdoor Specialist with OBS? I am not sure. It seems like the older i get, the more i yearn to learn more things. Here's the paradox!!! As i learn new stuff, i am getting more choices.....then got to choose from these varied choices available. Maybe i might even be an entrepreneur....It's the IN thing now. Secali 30 yrs later i might be the next real estate magnate.   Spoke to Michelle tis morning. She's now backpacking in Rome...going Venice next. I wished i could go next yr for my grad trip.I await her return to tell me all the stories she gathered from her Europe trip. Anyway, it doesnt matter where i go for a trip, what matter is i enjoy my trip.....might go back Cambodia ...heeheeheee....  Sharon and Litming are also on their grad trip. Spoke to them too....they just completed their Annapurna trek in Nepal and will be going over to Bangkok. Shopping spree...hahahaha....Sharon's kayaking cert is with me for ages liao....  going over to mel's hse play mahjong liao .....till next time Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
