Think about it...    Â  "Sometimes when people know a lot, they don't say anything. And sometimes when people don't know a lot, they say a lot."  Oh what a wonderful quote. It only makes me wonder about the ever so many people I know or have known. I cannot and will not name any names, but gee, the ones that talk a lot (when it comes to school and classes), hmmm...what does that say about them?? Gosh, it's odd but I totally AGREE!
