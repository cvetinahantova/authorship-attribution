First, I'd like to say my term has been co-opted by the more famous; designer Isaac Mizrahi has obviously been sneaking a peek at my blog and found the term "gay face."  If he'd only have given me credit, I wouldn't mind so much. Nonetheless, he makes an interesting point that minorities may have to have this transitionary period before acceptance, as he applies the term to the non-sexual, non-threatening, fairy godfathers of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."  Additionally, he also made the observation that "it is crazy to think that just because you are gay you have a great sense of style."

We need a more realistic portrayal of our lives."  Really people, if this is how we're viewed nowadays, is it that bad?  They could view us as insidious whore mongerers out to destroy Christianity, heterosexuality, western civilization, the sanctity of marriage, and boring wedding parties.  Oh wait...
