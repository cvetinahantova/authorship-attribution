urlLink     by gay Lennie who says that one of my eyes is smaller than the other, I've been parting my hair on the wrong side, my face is misshapen, I need to wax my eyebrows, and I should consider some eye cream to give my skin more elasticity.  At least he says I have a "good swirl" on the back of my head.  Incidentally, he puts Preparation H on the bags under his eyes to take the swelling down.  But I'll be damned if I've had a better haircut.  Marvelous.
