So, in my boredom as a lonely married lady, I decided to play with my blog again, and I discovered how to post cute pictures of my husband and I.  On another note....how is married life?  I get asked this question at least a hundred times a day.  So, listen up all you nonexistent blog readers:  Married life is lovely and I highly recommend it....except for the part where once you get married you never see each other anymore.  That's kind of a bummer.  Seriously though, when you know you've married an amazing person, nothing is more wonderful than being married to that person.  It's great to wake up every day and see that person and know that you are going to live this amazing adventure called life.  So, that's how married life is. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Erin & Ted in Florida 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink toot and puddle .
