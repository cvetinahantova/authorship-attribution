My dad is in town visiting. I love it when my dad comes. While I was catching up on sleeptime on Saturday morning, my dad was up rummaging around the kitchen. I could hear him cooking. Before heading out for a wedding that morning, he reminded me to lock the door and I reluntantly stumbled out of bed. As I walked back through the kitchen, I saw a big pot on the stove and a three-part instruction note on the counter:  1. Macaroni in the fridge. 2. Chicken soup in the pot. 3. Reheat the soup in the small pot and put the macaroni, add little salt.  HAVE A GOOD (with happy faces inside the "o"s) DAY! - Dad  Isn't my dad the cutest? Yeah, I'm spoiled. But hey, after not living at home for six years, it's nice to have someone cook. I had absolutely nothing in the fridge, I mean zilch, when my dad arrived. But the house  was  clean. Now, I have a clean house and hmmmm, macaroni chicken soup!!!
