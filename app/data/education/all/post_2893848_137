Tuesdays Suck   This is one of the few days of the week when my responsibilities include leaving the house, seeing other people, and not being near a computer all day.  This may be the only post today, and I don't want to waste it.  With that in mind, I give you drumming broccoli:          More of the food dudes will come as I get desperate, but a little teaser: there is a  urlLink hot dog .
