so, saw "the passion of the christ" today... you can read reviews of it everywhere, i don't need to tell you what it's all about.  i will say this... it's easy to make me sad or mad or scared or whatever... it's not so easy to make me cry.... and i did for a bit of the movie.  when i got to my car to go home, i turned off my radio and had perfect silence for the first time in 6 months.  it totally made me stop in my tracks and just think for awhile.  regardless of whatever else can be said about the direction, the script, etc., etc., etc.  movies that make you just have to freeze and contemplate are few and far between.  the end.
