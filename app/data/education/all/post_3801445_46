I am currently on a break from school. It's nice to have the time off, but the first of our only two real vacations in the year couldn't have come at a worse time. Having just got here, I have no money to spend to travel to somewhere nearby, like China, Japan, Thailand, or Australia. The other foreign teachers at our school who have been here for a while went to Australia. I'm jealous. Well, sorta. I have never really had a desire to see Australia all that badly. Seems like aÂ fairly pretentious travel destination to me because it's where "all the parties are, man!".  Anyway, I'm hanging around in Bundang and the Seoul area. I spent last night playing Risk with Jeanette at a boardgame-bang - they have places where you can go pay to play boardgames - it's pretty cool. The night before, I went out with Charlie for Kalbi and then drinks. We had a good time socializing...  All in all, I've been spending a lot of time just hanging around, sleeping in, and resting. Tomorrow, I hope to go to the nearby mountains to do a little bit of hiking. Other things that have been suggested to me that I do: visit the DMZ, see the Salvador Dali exhibit at the Seoul Museum of Art, go see Dundaemun market (a huge open-air market in Seoul)... I think that I have a lot of stuff cut out for me to do, but I don't imagine I'll make it to many of those places. I am planning on going down to the south of Korea on Friday and Saturday with Jeanette and her friend.  To everyone back home: I miss you all and I wish you could come visit! Korea is great!
