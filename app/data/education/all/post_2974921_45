turns out that ms. balonkita isn't so bad, considering the lecture we had this afternoon. she taught us all about the general and specific categories of personality. i found out that most of the time, i'm an extrovert. i love being with people and enjoying their company. i always stop everything i do just to be able to talk to some person who wanna talk to me. i welcome interruptions [except when i'm studying "seriously"]. but, of course, it's normal that i have an introvert side, too. when i'm in a bad mood, i usually drive people away and wanna be so alone. i also found out that i'm a feeling type of person. i'm sensitive to others' feelings [most of the time] and i always wanna please everybody in fear of hurting them. i'm sympathetic and i'm always available for advices. but i can get a bit analytical and thinking type-ish sometimes. there were times when i was already hurting someone without my knowledge.  ms. balonkita said it was normal for us to be a mixture of the different types since an individual isn't a constant matter... or something.  i also realized i really am a romantic type. i always see the better side of things and i always feel like smiling because the world, to me, is heaven.   *** i can't believe sir ralph knows i like him. curse those girls in front for being so damn loud. i can't believe i like him so much that i would fix up everytime he passed by and i would always turn to look when he's passing by... on the other building. i love those periods before lunch when he would come down from the faculty room to buy his lunch. he look especially cute today because he was wearing a shirt instead of a polo.   damn it....
