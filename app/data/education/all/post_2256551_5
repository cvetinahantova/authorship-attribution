okay today is pissing me off. I don't want to be here today. I don't have a camera I don't want to make the emulsions until I have a roll of film ready. But what else can I do with my time? I don't feel good. I feel like I am going to pass out! I feel like shit. It's probibly because I haven't eaten anything at all today except a granola bar. And that isn't nearly enough. Cuz my antibiotics will make me sick if I don't eat enough with them. So I am probibly going to get sick and thats not what I need.
