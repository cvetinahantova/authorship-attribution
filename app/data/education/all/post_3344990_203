I am experimenting with posting my blog to jcmoffitt.blogspot.com AND jcmoffitt.lifewithchrist.org  It appears that my blog on the Life with Christ blog mysteriously disappeared in the last 10 minutes so I am not sure what is up with that.  Hummmmm... Hey, its my day off and I guess I figured this would be fun to play with.   I am also toying around with a new w.bloggar plugin for Windows Media Player that is supposed to allow YOU my reading audience to see WHAT Music CD that I am currently listening to on my computer here at home.  Gosh, how is that going to work?  This must work through the Microsoft (Mickeysoft) .net architecture somehow.  Once I figure out HOW it works I will babble about it more in detail.  For now I am just hopping into this baby and giving it a spin to see what will happen.  hahahahaha  NO, I do not read manuals.  What fun is that??  Gosh, I think I finally figured out HOW to post and publish to multiple Web Logs using w.bloggar while I was writing this message.  BTW, Jeremy from Life With Christ wrote me back after my pinging him about something. Jeremy's respons we very quick and polite and I am very thankful for that.  Thanks Jeremy for your quick support.    Hummmmm what next.  Oh yeah, I need to post this to multiple blogs and see if this baby will blow up or not... hahahahahah
