When I'm feeling filled with anxiety and worry, now I know, that I can't hold on to it, or pretend that it doesn't exist.  I've got to talk about it, bring it out into the light, expose it so that it doesn't hold any power over me.  In this way I come to realize that the only solution to that feeling is to still my mind, center myself in the embrace of the eternal, the light of omniscient consciousness.  If I want my life to be a walking prayer, a walking meditation, a constant comminication with the divine, then I've got to start each day with the commitment and live each moment as if it were my last.
