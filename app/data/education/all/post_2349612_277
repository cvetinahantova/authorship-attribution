just chatted on IM for a little over an hour with michelle collins... and a good chat too =)  yay for this :-) and yay for friends!  amanda knocked on my door this morning with a long list of questions... now that i have a place to live in august, she's putting up an ad (with my permission) for a roommate starting august 15th so that i only pay half a month's rent for august, and save nearly $300 :-)  i hope she gets a respondent and that it all works out... i'm glad she's thinking ahead better than me! =)  now, to read or to write my REU talk... hmmm... probably some of both =P  later dudes
