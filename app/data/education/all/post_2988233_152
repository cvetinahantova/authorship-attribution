I laughed.  I cried.  And now I mourn.    Friends is over.  I know I can watch repeats for the next 10 years, but none will be the same as new episodes.    My heart lept with joy when Monica and Chandler found out there were twins.    My heart took a pause when  Rachel got on the plane.    I bawled when she got off.  I bawled even harder when they left their keys.    This show has been a staple for me the past 10 years.  It has been the only show I have watched religiously.  I don't get too attached to shows often.  Mainly because the ones I like usually get dropped.   Whoever those Nielson people are, they don't have the same taste as I do.  I can't stand those crime dramas.  When I watch TV I want to be entertained, to laugh, to forget my own troubles.  Not be reminded just how demented this world we live in is.  Friends was my escape.  I guess I will have to be happy with syndication, and plan on watching Joey in the fall.  ALl I know is he better be having a lot of guest appearances by his former freinds!
