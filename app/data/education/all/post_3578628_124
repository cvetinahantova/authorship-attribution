I warned that this would take a long time.  When I said that, I had a plan for where I was going.  It doesn't look like it's going to amount to anything because I planned on taking a long time.  You all (Spencer and Ambur) have said things that I agree with.  And because I chose to do this here, I have to accept what you say.  But that doesn't mean I have to follow it.  Look...if Josh Rendall had told me if he wants to meet in person to finish this or let me continue here, I could end this soon.  But it's going to last at least until Sunday night.  I am sorry that people have to deal with this.
