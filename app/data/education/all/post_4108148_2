Cool!  I just found out K-Lo is going to the same Bills game I am.  Hopefully we'll be able to meet up before the game for some fun tailgate action!   K-lo, if you want to hustle some people in a pickup football game in the parking lot before the game, let me know.        I just got back from getting my Haircut.  Yes, its been about a couple weeks, so it was needed ; ) I did end up going to Charlie's, but I was really considering going back to Famous Hair.  Last week, my ex that manages there stopped by my place to talk.  It was the first we've talked since we split.  Surprisingly, it was a really good time and didn't feel awkward at all.  She said that one of my favorite girls that work there was bothering her to talk to me to get me back there.  I know I will end up going back sometime, because Mary cuts the best hair in town - I should know since I have been to almost every place around.      The mystery of the wildflowers has been solved.  Last week, I saw some flowers left at the door going up to my place.  I wasn't sure if they were for me or one of my neighbors.  It turns out they were for my neighbor.  I'm relieved.  This means no stalker for me!  Yeah!
