We are very,very ready for the end of school. The kids, no matter how early or late the school calendar goes, sense about 3 weeks before school is over and stop.  They just stop--listening, working, behaving.  Therefore, teachers either struggle against the hopeless tide of misbehavior and silliness, or give in and do a lot of art projects (or like me some combination of the two).  My mother, who is also a teacher, has said for years now that what we really need to do is have a surprise end of the school year.  Never really let the kids know when school is suppose to let out.  Just all of a sudden one day tell them "Surprise!  School out!  Go home now!"  We'd all be much happier.
