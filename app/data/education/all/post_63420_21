Earlier today I had a conversation with a fellow blogger who asked about getting images included in his blog. While I've just been uploading the ones I've used to my own web site, there are other options for those who do not have a web site with file space.  If you are using  urlLink Blogspot  to create your blog (as many/most do), you are given an option of using Bloggerbot. However, clicking on the link generated the error message in the above posting. Instead, try this  urlLink URL  and you should get to the right place:    urlLink http://www.hello.com/how_bloggerbot_works.php    Using the link immediately above you can download the software and, in conjunction with with Picasa or Windows Explorer (not sure what Mac users do), you will have a method for transferring pictures to the web. (Bloggerbot offers free image hosting.) Unfortunately I wasn't able to get it working so smoothly on my first try (my last post) or in this post. (Otherwise I would be able to include the error picture within this message.)  I will obviously need to research this a little more.
