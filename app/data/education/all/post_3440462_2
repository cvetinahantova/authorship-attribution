It seems that every week we find some new part of our life that is killing us.  our hair spray bottles, fast food, the food industry in general, oppression of third world countries by american based multi-nationals - the list goes on and on.  The term that comes to mind when I hear about these atrocities is  "structural evil."  A two part question/discussion this week: Are these examples of structural evil, and if so as Christians what is the most appropriate response for us?   My two cents:  It seems to me that as "kingdom people;" that is, people who are embodying the character and righteousness of God, and whose communities are to reflect that character and righteousness, we are to be completely opposed to these acts of inhumanity.  Our opposition should start with non-participation; we will not, by the use of our money, underwrite these actions.  (hmmm.  But as I am using a computer, the components of which were assembled by near slave labor in Asia, am I in fact underwriting the actions of those companies?  Am I to stop using this computer, even as a tool to speak out against oppression?  hmmm.)  We should also speak out with one voice against all forms of oppression.  There. that's my 2c.  Agree?  Disagree? let me know.   urlLink
