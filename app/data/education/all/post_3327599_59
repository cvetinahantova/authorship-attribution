i don't know how to start this.. so i'll just start babbling like i have been all day! Sheila and i went to China King for dinner, it was sooo good. i love chinese food. after that we met Phil at the mall and he did some shopping (you still didn't buy my a present *pouts*). awesome poster btw.. johnny depp.. hehe. anyway. after that we went and picked up some hookers.. oh wait.. Sheila and i were the hookers.. anyway! we went to King Tat where i ran into someone i know.. i think she was really suprised to see me in there! then it was off to fun house to play. Sheila and i ran off and played some games and then Phil found us and i totally kicked his ass at Soul Calibur II.. haha.. no not really.. but i tried!! i beat Sheila at air hockey.. well after all that we got bored and Sheila went home so Phil and i went to his apartment and you guys can fill in the rest.. that would work if i didn't have such a large group of perverted friends! i stayed for like 2 mins and had to race home so i wasn't late! so yeah that was my day other then washing my car.. and giving the dog a bath..
