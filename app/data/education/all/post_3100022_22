The ten and a half hour plane trip was enjoyable and arriving in Singapore airport was very interesting. The departure gates are too numerous to count (hundreds) and up to forty 747's wait in queue to take off, which can take up to an hour of sitting in a plane grounded, waiting for your turn to leave. The Singapore terminal was nice, very tidy and slightly cooler than the 39 degree muggy tropical atmosphere outside. The Black beret topped guards with fully automatic weapons were a comforting sight, quite friendly and not at all intimidating, I had a chat with one and he was very friendly, but politely declined when I asked to take a photo of him. There were more shops in the Singapore terminal alone than there are in any two blocks of Hamilton. Something to laugh at: a small glass room which was one of the few places where smoking was permitted; presided on the first floor where people would go and sit like caged animals puffing on their death sticks. You could just about see the tar floating around inside that room, and the stale rank of cigarette smoke was something that will inspire poets anywhere to write only of death and morbidity if anything at all should they not give up the will to live first.
