Friday, March 26, 2004 I woke up quite late. I am still feeling a bit grumpy with the weather. Boy is it hot.  My girlfriend called me up early in the morning. I could not recall what she said except that she is going to march for the graduation. That is cool for at least one of us is able to finish graduate studies. I wish I could say the same for myself.  Often, I find myself wishing I were in other places, in other time, in a parallel world where things are better.  I know that I have to do something with my thesis-- and fast. I say that to myself to the ninth time. By grace of God, I know I will finish that thing probably just out of sheer persistence. I must otherwise I am in a deep fix.  Thus, I ate breakfast late. Health is something I should put more investment in. Admittedly that is not one of my strong suit. I am a slob. Well, a good one at that. I love books but I cannot seem to have all the time and the energy to read my collections. I think by now I have already thousands of books. My collection probably costs hundreds of thousands of pesos. Still, I am always short of money. Pauper, yet well feed, that is me, a walking irony, just like some of my books.  My neck also hurts. What else hurts? I could think of many sore muscles in my body. Indeed the mind is willing but the body is weak.
