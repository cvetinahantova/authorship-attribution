Well, another night passes, however, it passes slowly and quite fitfully.  I know why I'm not sleeping properly, but I dare not mention it aloud.  It's quite frustrating.  I did all that I was supposed to.  I stayed in school, got good marks, did the volunteer thing, went to university, got a degree, went back, got a second degree.  There.  The goals of society have been met, and where do I find myself?  Looking back at unemployment since November.  It's not supposed to be like this.  I guess I can find some sick comfort in the fact that I'm not alone.  Jeff is having the exact same problems as me, however, he has been able to work in the meantime.  I just plod through each day, wondering if I'm going to get to work.  I've applied for a few more Japanese jobs, but the NOVA experience has really taken the wind out of my sails.  It's quite aggrivating, wanting something so bad, but feeling that it is just out of reach.  There's the other thing that is really getting to me as of late.  I was always told not to set goals too high, so I never set goals like, "I"m going to be rich by 30."  All I want is a job.  A job that I will enjoy doing.  Is that an unrealistic goal?  I would certainly hope not.  It's amazing how people can take what they have for granted.  Staying with Kyle and Erika really opened my eyes to this.  Both of them have career jobs, they make about $72,000 / year (compard to Julie and my $9,800 / year) and yet they still seem quite unhappy.  They complain about money issues (makes me laugh), etc.  Kyle grunts and groans about his job, but will not get sympathy from me.  I'd do his job in a second if given the chance.  Well, that's all for today I guess.  I can only hope that tomorrow brings me some happiness, as this blog has gotten me feeling more down than when I started.  Well, I did have an awesome time fishing with Norm the other day.  Would be ideal if I had a little place, a boat, and loads of free time.  More dreaming sadly.  Until next time.
