The Fourth of July weekend is suddenly upon us.  I am looking forward to having three days off from school, and the chance to spend some time relaxing with my family.  My husband's birthday is on Sunday, and the boy child and I are planning on getting him a new barbecue grill and possibly a new lawn mower.  I do not feel that this is an unwise decision.  I suppose if I were to be fatalistic, I would be spending my time thinking about the next drinking incident.  That kind of fatalism does no one any good.  We know we have things to work on, but we have lives also.  We have a son.  So, going on.  Why are freshmen boys such idiots?  I've got an English class doing a webquest on  All Quiet on the Western Front .  They have a bunch of info to look up on the web and some questions to answer.  So what do I find?  Three goobers on MSN chat one of whom is listening/watching some kind of satanic, slasher, punk shit on Yahoo.  Sorry about that.  School is almost over for the day; I can go home and rest.
