Today was the first day of the rest of my life.  I signed my first (I'm sure of thousands) permission slip for my child. We dropped him off at Daycare today for the first time ever. He was so enthralled with the teachers and the toys, he didn't even notice that we left.  He slept badly last night. He woke up and fussed every few hours. Eventually it would get bad enough for us to go in there and pet him. I think he was cold, because we'd put his blanket on him and that seemed to solve it... Until he kicked it off... Then a few hours later, fussing. But he stayed lying down in the crib all night and ended up getting up for the day around 7, so it wasn't too bad. We just had to visit him 3 times in the night. It's like Marley said "You will be visited by your parents 3 times tonight!"
