As you all know I am big on Politics, I like to keep up on what's happening. And one of the biggest ways to keep up with political campaigns is to look at poll numbers. Poll numbers as you know are a projection based on a small diverse number of voters to see how a larger group would vote giving us a pretty good idea of the outcome of events.  I would like to from now on, on Thursdays, update you with the latest poll numbers on the Presidential Election.  New polls have come out today for Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, and Wisconsin. The August 2nd poll from Georgia shows a Strong hold for the Bush Campaign. An eleven percent lead and a Republican voting history show that this state will most likely go red again in 2004. Up to Illinois, a state that has solidly voted Democrat and consistently shown Democrat in the polls is. . . still leaning democrat. A 54%-39% poll shows Kerry in the lead in the Land of Lincoln. Michigan, our home state and a major player in presidential elections has stayed mostly even through the campaign, but in recent weeks has started to lean Kerry. The August 2nd poll shows Kerry in the lead 47%-42%. Out to Jersey, where although Ralph Nader has 6% of the polls Kerry still maintains a strong hold on the state 49%-36%. And the last poll of the day, Wisconsin. Another battleground state. The most recent poll shows a weak Kerry hold, of 47%-46%.  The overall vote count in the polls as of now in electoral votes in Kerry 307 Bush 231 as we kick start August. Expect republican numbers to go up as Kerry ads will slow down this month and Bush ads will go up as we approach the Republican Convention in New York.   *Polls Provided By Various Polling Companies And Compiled At   http://www.electoral-vote.com/index.html
