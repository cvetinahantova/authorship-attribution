Interesting day at School, had a fight and a child try to leave through a window in my lesson.  But topping both of these was the grafitti I found on a table at the back of my room.  It said...  "Mr Askew is a f___ing bastard!"  so now I have permanence of a kind.  I have made my mark on the school.  Not sure if I should be happy or sad. maybe someone could do one of those quizzes about that!?  (sorry if I offend you, don't mean to).
