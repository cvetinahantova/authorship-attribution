[part four]  Of course, exhibits, parties, and other occasions take place in school.  The room's background can be customized according to the theme of the celebration.  Filipiniana, retro, industrial, tropical, yuletide, and many other themes can be set to suit the occasion.  If a certain theme does not exist in the database, the user can also input the colors, patterns and design with the use of a camouflaged control panel beside the automatic sliding door to suit his own taste, then save it in the database.  He may even turn the room into a small chapel (by the way, although the school is run by Methodists, the chapel mode can also turn the room into a small Catholic chapel, a small mosque, or a small temple, depending on the guests' religions).     Equipment provided for these special occasions include bowls, plates, silverware, chopsticks, glasses, goblets, tables (dining, buffet, conference, or exhibit), chairs and all the gadgets and equipment used for studying and teaching.  Extra party needs (including food) are sent from the school's server to a specific store's computer, where all transactions are performed, including delivery setup.     After seeing all the features the classroom had to offer, I offered Dr. Capili a ride home in my battery-operated luxury car.  It also has a computer that can link to schools and offices so that a person can work and study while on the move.  Upon going home, my mind kept on thinking... thinking of a new way to make learning even easier than what we made.
