So its been a while, went away to Portugal with my family for a week or so.  Had a brilliant time!  Lots of Sun etc and very relaxing.  I'm developing expanded ambitions for this blog so might sort out a photo album type thing from the Holiday.     When we got home we found that the house had been sandblasted.  This is good because its now red not dirty white but bad for a number of reasons.  One such reason was that our garden began to resemble a nuclear waste land.  Our flower and herb pots were worst hit, and things that had been green and leafy were now short, grey stalks.  But life is stronger than death!  Three days later and theres green shoots everywhere again.  Resurrection, cool.
