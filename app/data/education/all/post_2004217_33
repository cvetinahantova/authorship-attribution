Since Tuesday Richard's been texting me. Naughty texts. Rude texts. Downright "I want you NOW" texts. Normally, this would make me immensely happy, and for a while I was- until Friday night, when I he was on MSN, when he reverted beck to normal Rich, the one that doesn't ask you how you are of answer any of your questions, and generally makes out like he doesn't want to be talking to you. Then he goes offline without saying goodbye. Konfused? So am I. I've got no idea whether the whole thing was a joke or whether he's found someone else who he fancies, or that girl from Wellingborough has asked him out. I already texted him twice in the last 2 days with no reply, so he probably already thinks I'm some weird stalker girl and that he's changed his mind about getting together with me at JYF.   I don't know why I bother, he's just living up to his reputation. He decides he likes a girl and then 5 minutes later another one comes along and he's gone. I think the reason I keep falling for him is because he dumped me the first time, during the first part of the relationship when you can't keep your hands off each other and can't stop thinking about each other either. Maybe if we got back together and it lasted a bit longer or was a bit more stable, if he dumped me again it wouldn't be so bad... oh it's pointless thinking about it because it's just not going to happen...  Ceff x   It's to dying in another's arms... and why I had to try it...
