Yeah, I've been trying to get this sharing application (WASTE: http://waste.sourceforge.net/) to work for a while now... there's been plenty of router resets and reboots involved, and it's still not working... apparently it's really cool and worth all of the trouble, though... heh Anywho, I'm really bored now... I think I'll go finish off the Sacrifice demo... I keep forgetting I haven't beat it, yet. I'll go do that in a minute. I think I'm going to come up with a money-making scheme, as well....
