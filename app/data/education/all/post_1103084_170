................................. playwriting oscar party .................................     i'd like to interupt our regularly scheduled programming to let all   PLAYWRITING alumni that you're invited to the RUDDS at 7 pm on Sunday night.  This years prolific playwrights will be coming too.   Please pass the word along to your peers who I've lost contact with!  Peace~
