They have this thing in churches around here called "Homecoming." I'd never really heard of a church having a homecoming party, but apparently, they do. Poplar Springs invited Karen Peck and New River, a gospel singing group that are apparently pretty popular, and had a big old pot-luck afterwards. It was the fullest I've ever seen that building, and let me tell you, it's a big building. It was pretty cool. I'm not all that big on gospel music, but they weren't bad. And there was a lot of good food. Yummy. :o)  Luke's going to be singing in a concert in Hartwell on Thursday so I'm going to go hear him. I'm very excited about that. He's going to come home with me afterwards, too, along with someone else, but I can't remember which of the girls it is. Chanda, probably. It'll be so nice to have someone in the house again! It's been hard the last couple of days. It's been very difficult to appreciate my singleness. Very.
