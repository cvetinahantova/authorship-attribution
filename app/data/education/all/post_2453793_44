i received a phone call tonight from my friend's girlfriend.  turns out she's interviewing for a job in the cities and wants to get an apartment and was wondering if i would be interested in finding one with her.  this is just what i needed.  i hope she gets the job.  it will be A LOT easier for me to convince myself to move out if there's someone else involved.  it's hard to motivate myself to find a new place because i'm scared of so many things.  plus, i really like her...and i wish i hung out more with her boyfriend (one of my good friends from college) because it seems like i never see him anymore.  i'd be living with a girl too...not to mention a normal one.  it would be so much fun.  i hope this all works out.  i've managed to convince myself that the boys don't deserve to have me as a friend.  i'm too nice and they take advantage of me.  i do so many things for them and the only thing i get in return is to be treated like crap.  it seems to me like i want their friendship a lot more than they want mine...so i guess it's time to start letting go.  they have already started to treat me like this stef girl they used to be friends with but cut off ties with...they don't answer the phone when i call (or just send me to the voicemail), talk badly about me, ignore me, act like i'm incredibly stupid, etc.  maybe it's for the best if we're not friends.  obviously we don't have enough in common or something.  i'm crying about this now.  i'm forever going to regret moving in here...for what it's done to me...for the friendships i won't have when i move out...for the horrible imprints i've left on the boys...for losing everything.  why didn't i listen to everybody when they told me not to do this?  just another tragic mistake made by yours truly....
