Have any questions tonight?   I don't. It's one of those rare nights when work seems to be done, or is assigned for someone else, and I can finally spend some time with the kids while they are on vacation. Already, I'm yawning...That's not a great sign is it? Well, I'm going to make this blog awfully short and very un-philosophical so I can get back to them. I hope your evening is as question free.
