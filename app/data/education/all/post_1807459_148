I love days off.  So relaxing and peaceful.  Today I took my hand at Apsan.  This is a mountin in the South of Deagu.  I managed to make it there and took the cable car to the top.  I've climbed it before but on a different section and I always wanted to take the cable car.  I got a little lost but was finally able to find my way.  It was pretty cloudy but I could pretty much make out where I lived.  Anyway it was good fun.   This evening I tried my hand at getting another Korean haircut.  Yeah I finally decided to cut the hair.  I've been trying to get Sara to cut it but she is always busy so I broke down and went somewhere today.  It isn't that bad actually.  They can never seem to do the sides exactly right but it's good enough.  The dude styled it pretty bad but he cut it well.  I can always restyle it so no big deal.  I'm so tired lately.  I wonder if I've got mono or something.  Anyway I'll keep this short and try to get a good nights sleep tonight.   Caleb wants to head out tomorrow night so Tim I'll be calling you.  Anyone else who reads this blog and wants to join is welcome.  I'm out, as opposed to in.  That was lame.
