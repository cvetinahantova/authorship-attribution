Brilliant! I love the comments that are beginning to surface...if you haven't read everything on the blog yet, go ahead and surf...be sure to read the comments under each post...  I just had an "aha" moment! Deductive logic (“It’s elementary my dear Watson”) brings fruitful ends! Science as a “way of knowing and doing” is a powerful method for discovery.  Whenever one is puzzled by a phenomenon, careful observation will often reveal a pattern, which then leads one to further investigate.  The result may yield uncompromising truths!  There is a reason for the "time delay" between the second you hit "publish post" and the time it is published!     It turns out that Blogger offers a special feature for the administrator.  Comments that are published are first sent to me to review via email.  Once I have downloaded your comment from the server, which I may want to delete if it is “inappropriate,” Blogger then publishes the posting.  That feature is an excellent one for teachers using Blogs with their class, as they may wish to censor or delete comments before they are published.      I recommend saving your comments in a word document in the event your posting is inadvertently erased.
