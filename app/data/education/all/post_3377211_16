Potential Employer:  ...we'd like for you to come in on Monday, June 21st at 11am for an interview for the sixth grade position.   And that's when I creamed my pants...  FINALLY!  Now that school is ending on Friday, it only makes sense that the first day of my summer vacation is spent preparing on how I would be a good addition at this particular school district.    This is the school where teachers tell me that they would like to see me wind up here.  This is the school that may be interested in me because of my extensive 6th grade teaching experience (albeit was student teaching and 90% of my substitute jobs).  This could be my money shot, but I won't get my hopes up.  I can't take myself out of the moment by having any expectations, and just take everything in as it comes.    ANNNNNDD... my Xbox is taking up a great deal of my time right now.  I regret giving it the cold shoulder when it first came out.  Everything on here is beautiful, forcing me to sell more of my Playstation 2 games in order to buy them for the prettier console.  Now I understand why people say the PS2 sucks in comparison to the Xbox (graphics make a lot of difference when one is crisp always and the other is always fuzzy like mold).  Anybody else think that this post was utterly pointless?
