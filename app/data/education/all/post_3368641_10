sometimes when I am quiet and in tune  I feel the cellular world within pop and fizzle as a message is delivered from this appetite to the body it inhabits and in a flash an arm lifts to light yet another cigarette in contemplation  and sometimes I feel nothing at all except the impulse and in a flash an arm lifts to light yet another cigarette in unconsciousness  and sometimes I feel everything at once and in a flash an arm lifts and I forget why so I light another cigarette to punctuate the moment of forgetfulness  and sometimes I have to remember that I smoke too much and think too little for my own good  Â© 2002 DC Vision
