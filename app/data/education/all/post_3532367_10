Well I started off this morning with a 13 mile bike ride. I really enjoyed it as the weather was great. Sandra had sent me out as I had started to pester after she had woken up. We had had sex the night before (usual routine on a towel) but she seemed more accepting of it, although again I had felt pressured to go ahead. We finally went to sleep at about 01:00, but I was awake again at 04:00 and couldn't really get back to sleep. It was very difficult trying to keep to myself, but I couldn't get myself up and out of bed to start any execrcise either.  When I got back from cycling, it was time for the chores - a little vaccuming and time out to mow the lawns. Just before lunch, we had a cuddle and I ended up undressing Sandra, but stopped short of full sex. I decided to distract myself with a little more gardening and Sandra came out and helped me.
