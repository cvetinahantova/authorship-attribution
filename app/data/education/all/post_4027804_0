Man, the Hoo Sisters are back!!!!!!! I missed them both. Now, it's back to me being called a wuss and a faggot. ::smriks:: I'm not a faggot! >.>  I really don't have anything to share with anyone, other than the fact that I hate being woken up before I have to, when I want/have to, because then, I get really pissy...  No, I don't feel like using the bathroom. My short temper takes it's toll. Now, go away.
