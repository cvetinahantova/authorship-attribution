have you ever had the feeling of wanting to know a person, yet unable to do so? when something in you knows that there is potential in having a relationship with the other person deeper than the superficial.  and i'm not even talking about a relationship in the romantic sense.   wala lang. friends lang.  ever had that feeling? bad trip ano? yung tipong nasasayangan ka dahil there is no situation that presents itself; no situation where you can get to know the other person more. feels like you're caught in the middle, unable to go either way.  madalas mangyari sa akin ito. ewan ko ba. minamalas lang siguro ako. or then again the excuse i give myself is that ganyan lang talaga ang buhay - mapaglaro.  no wonder madalas angsty ako.
