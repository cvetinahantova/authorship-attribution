In the wake of Joel Quile's  urlLink Post  on music, I began to think about the kind of music I like in general.  There are a lot of bands that I am proud that I like.  I am proud that I listen to Pillar, Sonicflood (the old lineup), Jennifer Knapp, Audio Adrenaline, and the Supertones (I actually am beginning to  love  SKA Punk).  I am even proud to listen to the Grateful Dead (I'll share my views on my first Dead show soon), Jimmy Buffett, and the Black Crowes.    I find that when you ask people what they listen to, the most common response is "everything".  So I ask you, Mr. Everything Listener, is that really true?  Do you listen to  everything ?  You do?  You routinely listen to classical?  Gregorian Chants?  Tejano?  Carl Lewis singing the National Anthem?   Everything ?  I don't think so.  I know you have your favorites and that is fine.  But you don't listen to everything.  Show me your John Tesh CD and I might start believing you...   But, what do you listen to that you are not so proud of?  What is the one band that you listen to that (if people knew) would be a source of ridicule?   Is it Eminem or the Dixie Chicks?  Is it Outkast or John Denver?  Do you like Megadeth or Yanni?  Who is it?  Enquiring minds want to know.  What gets your foot tapping that shouldn't?  Are you man (or woman) enough to say it here?   I bet you are.   Just for clarification, I have a lot of them.  Billy Idol.  Prince.  Will Smith's "Getting Jiggy Wit It".  Every 80's Hair Metal Band out there.  I love 'em all.    There you go.  My heart on my sleeve.    And now that I think about it, maybe I secretly do like John Tesh...
