Introducing my wife   Hi honey, I am home......  Errrrr  , ok, maybe it IS still ONLY 6:46 am and I am in my cage here at the office.  Nevertheless I do feel at home in cyberspace so I guess that statement was not too far fetched.  I invited Katy to our blog as a team member because WE are ONE.  Katy and I are like peas and carrots.  One of our favorite movies in the whole wide world was where Tom Hanks stated that " Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. "  We can relate to that statement aye ?  Katy is not as blabbery as I can be BUT when she does have something to say you ought to read every word and hang on every sylabble.  :)  I am GLAD that Blogger FINALLY got the Team Invite function fixed again.  How long have I been inviting you here??  Katy has a degree from the University of Texas at Austin in Psychology and Child development.  Katy has extensive experience in teaching children of all ages and putting up with me.  :)  Katy loves her new found hobby called scrapping, genealogy and being an all around house mom.  Whatcha going to write about hon??  ok, nuff said....
