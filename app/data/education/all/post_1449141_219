The CIA is shocked at incompetent actions by the Bush administration.  http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030728fa_fact  THE SYRIAN BET   by SEYMOUR M. HERSH   Did the Bush Administration burn a useful source on Al Qaeda?   Issue of 2003-07-28 Posted 2003-07-18      On the night of June 18th, Task Force 20, an American Special Operations team stationed in Iraq, expanded its operations dozens of miles inside Syria. Military intelligence had observed large numbers of cars and trucks speeding toward the border, and senior officers suspected that the vehicles were carrying fleeing members of the Iraqi leadership. Communications intercepts had indicated that there were more Syrian soldiers congregated along the border than usual, including some officers. The military concluded, according to a senior Administration official, that �something down there was going on.� Two days earlier, one of Saddam Hussein�s closest aides, Abid Hamid Mahmud, had been captured, and told his interrogators that he and Saddam�s two sons had sought refuge in Syria but were turned back. Although the Syrian government denied knowledge of the brothers� whereabouts, the military was now ready to cross the border to stop any future flight attempts.
