I have a suspicion that there are days when our mailman does not come to work.  I believe this because I will go for days (usually not more than 3) without getting a single thing in the mail.  Not even junk mail.  This just isn't realitic.  Everyone gets junk mail, whether credit card offers, coupon catalogs, or just random "resident" mailings.  So how is it possible to go for 3 straight days without so much as a local businesses coupon mailer, and other mailboxes still have their little red flags up.  I really think that the "neither snow, nor rain, nor sleet, nor hail" or whatever the whole thing is isn't actually true anymore.
