I feel like a glitchy robot   My health has been awful lately.  I've been sick for four days, first with food poisoning and now with an awful chest cold.  (It's odd, ralphing twice in three days for different reasons). This, coupled with all the work I've had to do has not made for much of a blog.  But fear not, I'll be back in the saddle again soon enough.  Please check back soon.
