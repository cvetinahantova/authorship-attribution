hello,  well it has been raining like crazy here.  i think i know what they mean by  monsoon season.  i guess it could be worse i could be in bangladesh or iraq.  jk.  no not really i love thailand and especially bangkok.  anyway... school  was a little difficult today.  i'm starting new subjects with a couple of my  english composition classes and it is proving extremely difficult.  also,  while i haven't moved into my new homeroom yet i've been spending more time  in there and trying to get to know the girls.  it's funny when i first  started teaching i couldn't tell any of them apart and i didn't think i  would ever be able.  now i notice all the little things that make them  unique in looks and attitude.  i'm excited about actually being able to call  names in class and not just numbers or by pointing (actually gesturing  because pointing is rude however they don't take offence at the farangs).   while i can learn the names in that class i'm still going to stick to the  numbers in the others to save time.  wish i could learn the all, but with  the number of students i have i don't think it is possible.  maybe next  semester i'll be able to work on this.  sewing class was the most challenging today.  i don't know how to sew and i  told sister erlinda this but she decided to give me the class anyway.  also,  she said the girls already knew how to sew i just needed to make sure they  were doing their work.  NOT TRUE.  a few of the girls can sew and cross  stitch, but not all.  so i was sending the ones with questions to the ones i  thought were doing the assignment correctly, ALSO WRONG THING TO DO.   finally the thai teacher for that homeroom, who incidentally i'll be paired  with as soon as i move into grade 3/2, came in and explained to the girls  how to complete the assignment.  thank god.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
