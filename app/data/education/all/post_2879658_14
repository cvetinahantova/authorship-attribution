OKINAWA  Well, yesterday I returned from a weekend trip to Okinawa (southernmost island of Japan) and must admit it was a great trip...just a little too short.  On Saturday morning, three friends and I left the cold of Miyagi in hopes of finding a little warmth and a relaxing escape from the march madness (or from going mad in march due to hours of complete boredom). Anyway, things I learned while in Okinawa....     1.  I really have made some incredible friends while here in Japan.  Everything was completely relaxed,             we were all open to just about anything and everything, and we shared a ton of laughs and made               quite a few lasting memories.   As I have realized throughout my life, it isn`t always where you are           but who you are with that makes all of the difference.  Viewing beautiful beaches and having nice           weather definitely does help though!     2.  I love driving!!!  Being the only member of the group with an international drivers license, I was the           designated driver for our entire stay in Okinawa.  Despite being on the opposite side of the car and          the road, driving has to be one of my favorite things.  It makes life so convenient!     3. In certain areas of Japan the people are some of the friendliest people in the world.  Maybe it`s the          tropical climate, but the people in Okinawa were always overly friendly and just enabled us to relax              and do as we pleased.     4. Having celebrated birthdays in different states across the US as well as in Australia, turning 23 in             Japan is going to be a pretty great birthday as well!!!!
