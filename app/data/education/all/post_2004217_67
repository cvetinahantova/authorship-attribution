When you look at certain people, you automatically think certain things, which tends to affect your judgement. There's a girl in year 12, and every time I look at her, I think "Her dad died", which of course makes me want to be more "sensitive" around her. That happened with Helen for a while, but now not so much. I wonder what people think when they look at me. In year 8, did my classmates think "There's Jess... her parents are divorced"? Did my best friends, in fact, do my best friends think "There's Jess, her dad's a knob" every time they look at me? Or do they just see me, Jess, wisecrack, Less Than Jake fan, English geek? It almost makes me want to keep it all inside in case they start being more "sensitive". I wouldn't want that; well, obviously I wouldn't want them rubbing their "happy families" in my face, but I don't expect them to be asking me how I am or if I want to "talk". Hopefully they know by now that I'm not one to go around broadcasting intimate details of my private life to anyone that will listen; if anyone wants to know that I don't want sticking their nose into my life, I'll crack a joke. But that doesn't mean that it gives them the right to take the piss out of my family, or my situation. That applies to anyone, from Wicked fucking Stepmother to Rachel Bradley.  I don't wanna talk about my Dad tonight. I don't wanna talk about how worthless I feel, or how right now I couldn't care less if he keeled over and died in his new wife's arms.
