Yeah so I've eaten like hell the last two days.  My aunt was nice enough to send me a tin of cookies which I've almost finished by myself in the span of two days.  The John Bacon Burger yesterday wasn't a step in the right direction either but it was so good.  My Korean lesson was canceled today so I'm left with a little time to blog.  I'm very happy with these new contact lenses.  My last ones sucked, or at least the left one did b/c it irritated the hell out of my eye.  I think I'll have to buy more glasses before I leave.  Just too good a bargin to pass up.  Mr. Kim called me today and woke me up looking for someone to judge a speech contest today.  I politly declined but I do wonder which teacher will get the pleasure.  Crap I've been taken over my msn.  Note to self never open msn while trying to blog.  Might write more later.
