...this insomnia has to go away sometime, right?  i miss chicago.  i miss the lights...and the feel of it at night.  i also miss montana.  the mountains are calling to me.  i feel like this city is suffocating me...i need to go back.  i will.  just as soon as i can save enough money and build up enough courage to get the hell out of here.  no one ever asks me about my childhood, and i really wish they would.  it's such a great tale.  i grew up in a world of imaginary unicorns and cardboard castles.  everything was vibrant and surrounded in beauty.  even in a place where our closest neighbors were several miles away and i didn't have any friends, i never felt alone.  if only i could go back in time - back to the times when i felt alive...  on another note, i'm sort of sad because i misplaced my dashboard confessional cd.  i'm listening to a burned copy of it right now.  it's the new cd.  i like it a lot.  it's actually gotten to a point where i can't even listen to the old cd's because i get so emotional.  i think this cd paints a more hopeful picture for me.  my "theme song" right now is actually off this cd.  i guess i'll end with the lyrics~        carve your heart out yourself.      hopelessness is your cell.      since you've drawn out these lines,      are you protected from trying times?       man it takes a silly girl      to lie about the dreams she has.      but lord, it takes a lonely one to wish      that she had never dreamt at all.       dig your ditch deep enough,      to keep you clear of the sun.      you've been burned more than once.      you don't think much of trust.       man it takes a silly girl      to lie about the dreams she has.      but lord, it takes a lonely one to wish      that she had never dreamt at all.       oh you're so sure      that i'll be leaving in the end,      you're treating me like i'm already gone.      but i'm not;      i will stay where you are, always
