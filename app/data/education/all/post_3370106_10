I have a choice to make everyday...do I stand tall in the light, facing my fears, courageously approaching each moment with deep reverence, or do I stray...I do stray, but now I quickly return to reverence, to mindfulness, to conscious commitment...each breath an honor and a blessing to behold...benefits of breathe outway anything material...concentration helps to intensify devotion to the divine eternal personal life energy spark...I honor that spark in all creation...come to me spirit of forgiveness and grace, come to me spirit of healing, spirit of wisdom, come to me great masters, I will always need guidance...
