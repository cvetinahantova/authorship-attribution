And now deep thoughts...     Being surrounded by so many people with different accents, my accent has definitely turned into something kind of strange.  I hear myself say things and am shocked because it doesn't sound like it should be coming out of my mouth.  After four years in Wisconsin, I am not sure if the time away has brought the southern accent to the forefront again or if the Brits I am running around with here are having more of an effect on me than I am on them.  But it isn't just the accent, the word intonations as well as in some instances my initial choice of words is something completely different.  On to some examples...       Example 1 - So I am hanging out with a couple of friends and one of them is                   chatting with a guy.  I then go on to give her a bit of a hard time and to ensure she knows I                am just teasing a bit, I then state that I am " just taking the piss out of                her ."  I don't think that expression will be welcomed when I return to the U.S.      Example 2-  So I am hanging out with random friends and in order to make a               decision about where to eat I ask them if they  fancy  doing italian...I don`t               think I ever used the word fancy in the U.S.      Example 3 - Now when I find certain individuals to be really nice and inviting, they               are no longer nice or cool or really friendly.  Now these people are described as                  lovely .  Oh yea, and I now describe a really good meal as nice or lovely as               well.       Example 4  - Males are no longer hot or good looking or really attractive...they are                FIT !  Fit is apparently the all encompassing term.       Example 5 -  I now sometimes even use words like going to the loo, standing in a              queue, taking the lift, or even saying "do you reckon" on occasion.   So anyway, when I really think about it, I now see how babies suddenly go from not speaking at all, to knowing several words and then soon enough they are talking.  That`s kind of what I have done here.  When I first arrived I could barely even say hello in Japanese and so I was often the silent one in restaurants or shopping and so on because I depended on other people to communicate on my behalf.  Then slowly I learned the most important daily vocabulary words and some key phrases and slowly started forming basic sentences. Now, while I still do not know nearly as much as I should, I can ask for directions, order food, read signs (as long as they are not in kanji), etc.  So basically, what I went through the first couple years of my life I kind of went through all over again.  The weird thing is that in many ways the impact all of my friends are having on the words I use, the intonation, and even the accent a bit when I am speaking english, kind of makes me realize how language develops and people's individual ways of speaking are all connected or a result of the surrounding environment and community.
