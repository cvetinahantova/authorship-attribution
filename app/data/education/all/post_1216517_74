The fans are out there waiting for me.  I straighten my cap, take a breath and put on my game face.   I never set foot on the field, but I am as much a part of baseball as the starting pitcher. I hawk peanuts.  Home Field Advantage Senior hawkers (many have worked the stadium for decades) get first choice of territory and product.  Hawkers get a commission on the dollar amount of product they move, so it�s better to hawk ice cream or peanuts than licorice ropes or bottled water.  Senior hawkers usually opt for field level, where more affluent fans sit.  But on sell-out nights, the view section offers the highest hawker-to-fan ratio.  Wander into a senior hawker�s section with your tray of lemonade, and prepare for ejection.  The Call Each hawker�s call must be loud and clear, yet entertaining.  I have adopted a Brooklyn accent� my small tribute to baseball�s golden age, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants ruled the field.   As for volume, I can hear my voice echo off the far side of the stadium.     The Pitch Ice cream and cotton candy are best pitched to children.  I dangle cotton candy close to kids, encouraging them to whine.  If kids ask for ice cream, I�ll hand it over and hope they take a bite before their parents notice.  Peanuts, better directed to middle-aged men, require a more sophisticated approach.  When The Wave circles the stadium, I time it perfectly and yell �Everybody who wants peanuts stand up!�  This ploy never fails.
