urlLink Using Spreadsheets in Mathematics Education. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by S. Ali Ozgun-Koca.  From the ERIC Digest:  "Spreadsheets build an ideal bridge between arithmetic and algebra and allow the student free movement between the two worlds. Students look for patterns, construct algebraic expressions, generalize concepts, justify conjectures, and establish the equivalence of two models as intrinsic and meaningful needs rather than as arbitrary requirements posed by the teacher." (Friedlander, 1998, p. 383)   Electronic spreadsheets have been created and used mainly as tools for mathematical and statistical calculations, as numerical or textual data can be inserted into their columns and rows (http://wwwstaff.murdoch.edu.au/ ~kissane/spreadsheets.htm). So, being able to manage spreadsheets has become one of the skills sought for anybody in this technologically enhanced millennium. Therefore, spreadsheets have become an important part of many different curriculums at different levels of education. Moreover, they have been used in education, especially mathematics education, as a tool in helping students understand mathematical concepts such as plotting and exploring functions and patterns, exploring probability and statistics, mathematical modeling, and geometric transformations (http://www.freshpond .net/treasures/math/spreadsheet/default.htm). Relationships among different types of representations such as tables, equations and graphs are more easily comprehendible when all representations are visible at once and linked to each other, i.e. when one makes a change in one representation, corresponding changes in other representations are offered by the program. Moreover, spreadsheets allow students to focus on the mathematical reasoning by freeing them from the burden of calculations and algebraic manipulations.
