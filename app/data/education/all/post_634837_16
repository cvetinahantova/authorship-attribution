our poem of silence   how did we come to this a consensus to hold the peace, to uphold the last shred of civility and  then we find ourselves returning, to values we thought were abandoned, to choruses we thought were worn thin.   before we know it, we are at words again. the incomplete sentences finishing their end rhymes, the show of forceful morality upon the break of tears.   so let's finish our game.  before we begin,  shall we come to a consensus - again?
