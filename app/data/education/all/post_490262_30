Hi, I'm back.  This week has been crazier than most (and for an elementary school teacher that's saying something!).  We performed out "Tall Tales and Heroes" musical extravaganza last night and it was great...well, good...OK, it was cute in that little kid performance way.  Like most things in elementary school, we were at the mercy of the parents.  About a third of our chorus didn't show, as well as 2-3 speaking parts that had to be re-cast last minute.  But it's done and next week is Spring Break so enough about that!  One of the best things about teaching is the time off.  I'll admit it.  I love Spring Break, Christmas Break, Summer Break, Mid-Winter Break and all the assorted federal holidays that we get off.  One of the worst things about teaching is the fact that you don't make enough money to go anywhere or do anything on all these breaks.  So I'll be spending Spring Break at home with the baby and dogs (my husband was off this week).  I plan on sleeping in as long as the baby will let me and maybe getting a little reading done.    What I would like to do during Spring Break (besides a trip to Italy, or Arizona or anywhere sunny and warm) is get myself organized for the last 9 weeks of the school year.  Clean out closets and stuff at home, get caught up on grading and planning at school.  However, I'm a realist and I will be lucky to get the Cheerios swept off the floor before the are pulverized this week. *sigh*  Maybe I should drastically lower my expectation and plan of going back to work with the house a total wreck and no lesson plans for the week.  Then anything accomplished will be a nice surprise. :>)
