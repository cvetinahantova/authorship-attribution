Books   Leshon suggested that i should read Margaret Atwood with her...I'm still looking for more suggestions!  Greg has a copy of the   Naval History of the War of 1812   by TR for me to drool over, but that doesn't get me out of the rut of American history.  (plus, after tonight's party, I left it at the house)  Chris Todd also has a copy of the book from the guy who thinks the chinese discovered North America, but Eric will read that first anyway.     Political Fashion   Nancy Pelosi bought into Teresa Heinz Kerry's line of "ketchup scented clothing" (jon stewart) for her CNN walkby tonight.    Go DC!   The Democratic Party's platform, for the first time since 1988 does not include a plant for DC Statehood.  urlLink DC Democrats  decided to take that matter into their own hands by threatening to nominate DC Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton for VP in order to give her a speaking slot on the night of Edwards' nomination. I'm a little annoyed that they completely capitulated on their criticism of the DemParty once Eleanor was given a prime time speaking slot on the night that Kerry is nominated, but at least she got it. More on this issue later.   thank you also to the DC Politics Hour (my favorite show on WAMU) for bringing this to my attention :).   Finally....  Thank you to Storey, Neil and Julian, all who found my blog :).  I'll try to make it worth reading.  Now I'm off to bed, because tomorrow involves driving to norristown to look at a new car.
