so, haven't been here, updating, for a long time... sorry.. not that i've been, running out of ideas, but, running out of time.. heh..  another song, here it goes.. ___________________________________ You said, "I love you, I'll do anything for you.." Well, You've stole the words, I wanted to say...  I'm glad you feel, The same as I do.. Now, You've made me feel, Something brand new...  And this something i feel, reaffirms my love for you, I, found something i can't replace, And that someone is you... -----------------------------------  how's this one?? i think its ok.. a bit dashboard-dy..  now, here's a poem..  __________________________________  Let Me Be... ------------  Let me be your shoulder to cry on, Let me be your listening ear.. Let me be the one you confide in, Let me be the one you hold dear.. Let me be with you when i'm not around, Let me be with you through all your downs.. Let me love you with all my might. And if i don't ask for anything in return, Let me be your true love..... -----------------------------------  I love you shazleen.. i wish i could do anything for you, but i'm only no one.. but, I love you.. i want it to mean alot.. (",)  Every night i still miss you, And only you, Makes my world go round..
