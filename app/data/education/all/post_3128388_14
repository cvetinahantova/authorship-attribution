I profess to being very scardified by this posh WYSIWIG editor for Blogger rather than the good old HTML one. As a result I am very definitely doing this in the HTML view. I have discovered to my disgust that the Ctrl+B shortcuts on WYSIWIG add silly SPAN tags rather than a simple B one, or I one. What a waste of space.  Went to RAF Fairford for the  urlLink Armed Forces Youth Day  today. It was OK; and would have been infinitely better had it not been absolutely tipping it down for most of the day, which also entailed there being much less flying :(. It was mostly delayed by 4 hours if it flew at all, though there were some nice loud things like a B1 Lancer that took off and... didn't return. And the usualy displaying tornados, harriers and what I think was an F-17. Watch some pop-star person with a name beginning with "J" today. She was singing on the stage. There were people behind me cheering for her to take her top off, and we were all trying to encourage people to throw hats and frisbee things onto the stage in order to try and hit her. They all missed however :(. Had lots of nice food though, including a Crepe (with apple and cinnamon,) some chips (yum :D) and a cornetto thing. Me eat more ;). But I'm done for now, at least until I go downstairs to eat more.  Listening to: Day-in. Day-out.
