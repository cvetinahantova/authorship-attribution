No, no I am not going to be a WWE Diva, but apparently my brother is.  The form is sitting here right next to his laptop.  Anyone who knows me understands that this is bizarre even for my family.  I haven't watched wrestling since the mid 80's (insert Devo song) so you know it isn't mine.  But really the only reasonable explanation is that Emily his gf is going to try out.  Hell she did try out to be a Kings dancer, who knows this could be here thing.
