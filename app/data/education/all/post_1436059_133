Went for a change. Dunno why.  Mom left today, and dad went to take General back to the vet hospital again. Shelby is somewhere, and I'm here. Here.   I'm gonna miss mom so much.   In any case, I've had a crap weekend that I'm going to try and forget about, or at least try and make it better as I can. I'll bend over backwards to make things better but it requires people to understand that I do make mistakes and I am sorry for them. It seems I'm always making mistakes, but I'll promise anyone that I would never make the same mistake twice. I was ticked off at myself yesterday for being stupid, but now it seems a little stupid. I mean, I'll always be sorry, but what am I supposed to do if someone won't accept my apology?  Anyway, I'm starting to feel a little better because I know it can't get any worse than this. I have my first meet on Thursday. There's the whole surgery thing on Friday but I'm only worried about it if I have to go to school looking worse than I do every other day. :-)  I really, really don't want to go to school this week. I never really want to go to school anyway, but this week, I can already tell it will be a load of not-so-hot stuff...   I'm full of regret For all the things that I have done and said And I don't know If it will ever be okay to show My face 'round here Sometimes I wonder if I disappear  Would you ever turn your head and look See if I'm gone, 'Cause I fear There is nothing left to say to you That you wanna hear, That you wanna know... I think I should go The things I've done are way to shameful...   Mandy cheered me up today. She's good at that because she's always happy and she lives right down the street. Johnen walked over to my neighborhood randomly and said he was just stopping by. See, it's already getting better than yesterday morning...I just don't want to go to school tomorrow...
