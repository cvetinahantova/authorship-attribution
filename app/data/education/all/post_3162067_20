Much as I have wanted to return to work, having been off sick for so long I now find myself very very anxious at the thought of returning. I've just spent a couple of hours planning my A-level lessons, and I'm about to mark some homework and do the rest of my planning, and about a thousand things are running through my head. Must remember to do this; must remember to speak to so-and-so about this, what's waiting for me in my pigeon-hole?, what stuff do I have to prioritise? I must admit that it makes me feel quite sick. I'm just about to email those two job agencies with regards to my interview next Monday. The thought that this teaching life will soon be behind me is virtually all that keeps me going, although I'd feel a whole lot easier about it if I had a job.
