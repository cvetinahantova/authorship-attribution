I had a dream about  Ash Tiffannee and me  the other night. We were getting tattoos..lol Tiffanee, no dout, got a huge penguim on her back  I am not really sure what ashley got really... it was some type of scene all I saw was that her back was cover and it looked a widlerness and the guy doing the tattoo ran out of blank ink and told us to come back the next day to finish hers up...as for me I was still deciding.. I think I decided on horses... but when I woke up I was like no way..lol I will show you the tatoo I am getting..it is going to be on my back probaly my low back. My best friend Seth made it for me.. it is an angel and I love angels..
