urlLink Link to story    Blue Springs Police Sgt. Mike Kruger says there are a few good people left. 'There are more honest people out there,' Kruger said. 'Sometimes we are pessimistic.' Krueger's faith was renewed about 10 a.m. yesterday when a Blue Springs man, about 37, turned in a bagful of money to the Blue Springs Police Department. The man asked to police not to release his name. 'He just wanted to do the right thing,' Kruger said. 'That's was just they way he wanted to handle it.' The bag, which Kruger said contained about $200,000, fell out of a PSI armored truck around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday on Interstate 70. Police counted the money and returned it to PSI. 'It's unusual,' Kruger said. 'It's not something that happens every day. I think that this was an honest person.'
