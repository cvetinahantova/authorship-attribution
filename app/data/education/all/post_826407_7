I've got a job!  I had an interview yesterday and am very happy.  Before going to the School I was unsure about it, some people had put me off by the things they said.  But the kids and staff I met all seemed very positive about it and I loved the place.  All the other candidates were given jobs too so there'll be a bunch of us starting in the same boat.  Start in September.  So that's it settled.  I�ll absolutely definitely be a teacher.  Cool testimony/God story thing.  The night before the interview H had prayed that I would feel peace in my heart if this was the right job.  Part of me had just dismissed that as fuzzy spiritual waffle.  I agree and know its biblical but have no real idea what "Peace in my heart" meant.  But almost as soon as I got to the school I felt comfortable and welcome; like this was a good place for me to be.  It wasn�t a deep spiritual feeling or anything but the peace we had prayed for.  It's nice when prayers and real life meet.
