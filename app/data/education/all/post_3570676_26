Okay, so like when does one know one is blogging? Did I blog when I answered those questions about myself? Am I blogging now? Or, perhaps I'll blog when I look at those websites and comment on them? Wait a minute, I know what bloggy is!  It's that weather condition that necessitates the use of one's low beams.
