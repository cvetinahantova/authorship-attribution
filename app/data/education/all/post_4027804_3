I wish I had a job. It takes effort to getting one, and yet one hates having to go to one. I, have worked before, and knwo regardless, I want one. Maybe, maybe the Subway down the street, or the Burger King next to it will hire me. It's my best bet.   Gosh, I hate driving school. Well, no, I hate having to do things when I never asked to do them, or have to do them before I wish to (when I have a choice).   Maybe I'll find some solitude and sanctum in a new online rpg...PSO.   The world around him was so distasteful. Everything that he sees is so bothersome to him, and he is having some insecure troubles with himself about things that could be changed, but considering his dispositon, there is nothing he can do. He is left with holding in his problems, wishing and hoping they can be resolved sometime in the future, but until then, he dives himself into fantasy and pleasure to mask this phase of reality with another.
