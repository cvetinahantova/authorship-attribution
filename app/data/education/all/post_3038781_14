Where's the website?    Well, I don't know yet. But I hope to shortly. It's still exam week and I'm halfway through my final for the Regulatory Environment of Business Law... [That's a long way of saying "the first year of Law School" in six weeks]... and I went through the first year of Law school...  But, I'm feeling much better now,  to borrow an old night court line ... actually, I really loved it ... But, it was just too tough at an already too tough time of my life... Just before Larkin passed. Borrowing from a Dharma and Greg reference > 5 bottles of antacid a day, 10 aspirins, 15 espresso's, and  an  ulcer: It was the best time of my life. Aside from losing Larkin,  it really may have been.   In part because it's where I met DMV... [no I didn't get a lot of tickets]. DMV is in many senses a kindred spirit, my closest friend, and one of the three people in my life that I consider to be a mentor/guru. In fact she's the one who pointed out how g.u.r.u. worked as a mnemonic for self-actualization... gee-you-are-you... It sort of fits.   The other two are my brother MSH, and another friend  FSF from school in the bachelor's program actually, but another kindrid spirit... In some ways DMV and FSF seem Gendered Versions of the Same spirit... but I don't think I'll elaborate on that ... at least not until the exam's over.     Take Care
