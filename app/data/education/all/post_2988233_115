My oldest son has acne.  He inherited it from me.  I didn't get it until I had children, go figure.   I was helping him last night, put the cream on his face the doc had prescribed.  He complained, griped and generallly pouted at me the entire time.    After he stomped into the kitchen, I asked my husband, "did I do something wrong?"  "yep, you  helped him."  "14 year old boys don't want help from mommy"    So, it is me. The attitude, the remarks, the ongoing bad mood, is all my fault.  Thanks for clearing that up.  Now I have 4 more sons to look forward to.   I will be doing good if I live thru thier puberty.
