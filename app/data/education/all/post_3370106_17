October 26, 1985-2003, An 18-Year Prayer on Meditation                                                                                                Rob Curtner       Circle of Love and Light,  First Mother and First Father,  Presence of the void,  Over, around and within all that is,     Divine oneness so simple,  We sit in quiet disturbance,  Letting go of more than we hold on to.  Give us peace and vision.     Bring these truths into focus,  Keep them in our minds.  Let our thoughts and actions  Go to God.  Give us those loving eyes.     Deep within the heart of hearts,  Beyond form and time,  Beyond the beginning and the end,  The always already watches all.     In the room where nothing is everything,  Where oneness counts most,  Let our thoughts be prayers,  Bringing all into alignment.     In deepest dreaming, watching still,  Watching all we do, all we are,  Removing limits on what can be.  Free thoughts leading to freedom.  Every breath a universe, a day and a night.     Wholeness, holy place every where the same  Complete, all in one, offering peace.  Guide us to this place inside,  Sitting on the mountain still.
