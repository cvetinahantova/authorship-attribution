i had a small discussion with my mom about why half naked women are always in commercials.. whether it's for underwear or weed whackers.. they are always in skimpy little two peices. so i thought about some of the innocent commercials (what little we have) and figured they weren't as innocent as we thought.. when you think about them in the way they were meant to be heard.    Glade Plug Ins-- Plug it in plug it in  Reeses-- There's no wrong way to eat a reeses  Campbells-- Mmm... Mmm... Good  Energizer Batteries-- it keeps going and going and going and...  Reasors-- The right stuff.. the right price..  Nike-- Just do it  Almond Joy-- Sometimes you feel like a nut  Applebee's-- Eatin' good in the neighborhood   Mountain Dew-- Do the Dude   Dell-- Easy as dell  Dr. Pepper-- Nothing's better  Toyota-- Get the feeling  Herbal Essence Hair Dye-- Join the steaking party ~~Herbal Essence products in general are dirty..
