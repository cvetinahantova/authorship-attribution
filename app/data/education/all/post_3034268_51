The bad news: I spent five hours writing the last post.  The good news: Five hours ago, I had no idea what I was going to write my paper about, and now I have a rough draft that is over twice as long as the five page minimum (when double space, 12 font, Times New Roman).  I'm going to sleep.  I've written over twenty four pages today, did my laundry, cleaned the kitchen, and played Medieval: Total War for two hours (killing the Egyptian-Muslim infidels with my panzy Frenchmen, and then getting invaded by another Muslim faction from the south)--making this the single most productive day of my LIFE!  I love(m) life.
