Looking back it is clear that I was trying to maintain an unsustainable vibration, a chemical buzz that nearly crushed me with fantasy.  Not a place I want to take myself again today, not a place I want to crawl to on my knees, not a place I want to lay myself down in with all that guilt, remorse and shame.  I was trying to hold on to an enlarging gulf, an engrossing divide, widening, leaving me ever more disconnected than the day before.  Even now, the aftertaste is not something that leaves one quickly, nor is it something to cling to, but the memories remain.  I claim all of them, realizing that they can't harm me, that my destiny lies ahead of me, my memories are not barriers, only reminders of the person I was.    I'm making progress, deepening my spiritual commitments, allowing my life to be an ongoing prayer, allowing my life to bleed from the edges, infusing the layers of now with healing light, seeping in and out, breath and breathlessness circling the amphitheatre of my spine.  Bodies align slowly and I will rest in mine learning to look at myself from the inside, sensing, feeling, acting out of a calm spirit-center, engaged in the moments that surround me, filled with light eternal, expecting nothing, but forever open to the possiblities for transformation.
