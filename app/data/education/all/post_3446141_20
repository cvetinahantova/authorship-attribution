Ok so I'm supposed to be packing, but I am taking a break.  I've got all my clothes and whatnot packed but now I'm on to all the crap that I need to get ready with so I really can't pack any of that till tomorrow morning after I get ready.  Pray that I wake up on time!!!!!!!!!  My flight isn't until 9:50 am, but I'm gonna have to leave around 8ish to make sure I can get through any security checks that I might have to go through.  Anyway, I'm taking a laptop with me so hopefully I will be able to get on it while I'm there and keep in touch.  I will keep everyone updated as to what is going on with Balloonapoloza.  Hee hee.  Oh yes it's gonna be a blast!  Actually I'm really close to the mall, so that is promising! Depending on what time they close.  Ok well I'm gonna get back to packing.  Or maybe I will just play around on the internet for a little while longer.......hummmmmmmmm.
