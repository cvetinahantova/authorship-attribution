i had such a nice day today.  i walked all over town today!  well, maybe not the whole town but my section of it.  i walked over to austin & brooke's unexpectedly...was greeted at the door by austin in his bathrobe.  with the time change it was already 1.  so, austin & i played boggle for a while.  then once brooke woke up we walked all of the way to green mill (about 1.5-2 miles maybe).  we ate pizza, which was tasty.  then we walked back and on the way home we stopped at the grand ole creamery.  just got home about a half an hour ago.  it was such a beautiful day out so i'm glad i had the opportunity to walk around so much.  sorta tired now though.  probably will be an early night for me.  i'm debating whether or not to run back to the apartment and grab some new clothes for tomorrow.  i kind of want to wear a skirt or something...i don't know.  i hate driving all of the way over there though.  maybe if i take a quick nap...
