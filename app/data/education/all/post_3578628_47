Does this term catch your attention?  It might if running under it was a line that read "There's a new trend among vegetarians-  eating meat ."  I had to click because this just seemed impossible.  It was worse than I thought.  Apparently, no longer is it a black or white system where you're either a vegetarian or not.  There's a large part of it that can be in between.  Check this out:  Vegans: Do not eat meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs or honey.   (These people are hardcore.)  Strict vegetarians: Do not eat meat, poultry or fish.  (These are the weaker because they see no problem with eggs or honey.  After all,  they aren't meat  !  Flexitarians: Include the groups below:   -- Vegetarian: Those who say they are vegetarian, or "almost vegetarian," but use some meat, poultry or fish.   -- Vegetarian-inclined: Replace meat with meat alternatives for at least some meals, usually maintain a vegetarian diet, or eat four or more meatless meals per week.   -- Health-conscious: Strive for a balanced eating plan or eat two to three meatless meals per week.   This is where I have a problem.  What is vegetarian-inclined?  I know several people who are vegetarian-inclined because they can't afford to buy meat.  Health-conscious?  Two or three meatless meals are nothin! There's no way you could possibly be healthy like a true vegetarian.  Nope, you just think you are.  And I think this flexitarian thing is incredibly retarded.
