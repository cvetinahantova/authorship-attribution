I've been investigating this site, and I can't quite figure out how people are supposed to find particular blogs or bloggers. From the Dashboard, all that's available is the (quite lame and out-of-date) Blogs of Note and the Recently Updated. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there doesn't seem to be a main page from which one can search or browse categories. The only other method I have found is to view my own profile and click on the links for stuff I listed as interests or favorites; that'll then produce a list of other bloggers who listed the same item, and then you can go to their profile, and from there to their blogs. Doesn't that seem a little convoluted and counter-intuitive? What if I'm looking for something that I haven't listed as one of my interests or favorites? How about something topical, news-related? It's no wonder so many of the other blogs that I have looked at have posts without any comments. I'm at a bit of a loss ...
