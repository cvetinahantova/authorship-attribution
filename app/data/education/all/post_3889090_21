My continued existence is not the top priority. The notion of hell is an eternal existnace that isn't pleasant at all. If faced  with hell, I would rather not exist. So continued existence is not the top priority. What is then? Continued existence is surely important. To cease to exist renders all previous existence completely meaningless. If one does not exist then one cannot enjoy or benefit from anything, even the thought of anything one has previously done when one did exist.  Sidetrack: It seems eternal existence is a precondition for meaning in life...
