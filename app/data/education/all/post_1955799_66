Oh, Special thanks to Berry, for kicking me in the pants about keeping the writing up.  Now that I have free time, might as well put it to good use.  LOL  My co-worker allowerd her son to have a copy of Anne Rice's "Queen of the Damned."  Her son's like 12.  I didn't think that was a book for kids.  It was far too mature.  She looked shocked by that, but I had this feeling that she didn't want to take too much responsiblity for him having the book.  That's just my opinion though.  I could be wrong.
