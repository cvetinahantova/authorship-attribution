i'm so head over heels! jammi is all i could ever ask for.  we had an interview session just now. i had fun. i was truthful with the things i said. i said good profile and looks did matter to me. i just wish so much that he thinks he's perfect for my type of guy because he is! my gosh, i'm so "inspired"....  the last part was realy funny and kinda hot at the same time. i asked him what would give his girl extra points and he said it would be an extra point if she was naughty and nice. i teased him saying,[in tagalog]"what will happen? i'm only naughty?". and he asked the most shocking question: "are you trying to turn me on?" i said, "why? are you aroused?" he replied,"would it be a minus if i was?" then i said something and he said,"if u werent tryin to turn me on, makes me think how it would be when you try" hehehehe....i'm having fun recalling every single moment i'm chatting with him. makes my day a lot more....lovely....damn, it's too good to be true. i bet something bad's gonna happen....
