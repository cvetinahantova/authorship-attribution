Yesterday I didn't wear a t-shirt under my main shirt.  I felt funny, like I was walking around with no undies on.  LOL.  I know that may sound silly, but I am used to an undershirt beneath the shirt.  It felt naughty, almost.  I'm so old-fashioned.  LOLOL!!!!  I'll get myself out of that.    I'm still trying to figure out a solution to my class scheldue.  It's not so successful.  The only salvageable news is that I'll be done with the core classes this semester, and I may take my QuarkExpress class sooner.   The Library's louder than usual, for the summer that is.  It's ok.     Song of the Day:  Angel in Disguise by Brandy.  Why?  It's what's playing in my car.
