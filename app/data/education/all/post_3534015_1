Odd things happen when you stop relying on your parents for information and start looking at things on your own.  I might actually follow Herman's lead this election and decline my ballot in a vote of no-confidence.  Or I may vote Conservative.  My sister posted a link to all the parties running in my area. I would vote Green party, if they weren't for Gay marriage.  EVERYTHING else on their list falls in line with my political views. But I feel VERY strongly against that, so I won't be voting for them. The Liberal Party is out of the question!!  I have no confidence in their ability to do anything. I question the Conservative Party.  I am a bit uncertain about a few of their policies.  Of all the parties, I hold most to the Conservative party platform.  I do doubt their ability to carry it out in full. I am completely ANTI-NDP.  What we need is a Conservative-Green party of Canada.  Or a Social-Conservative party.  Something that takes all the best of each and combines them into one solid platform.
