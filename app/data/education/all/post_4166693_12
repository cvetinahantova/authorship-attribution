This came about while we were making burritos the other night:  R. shredding a lot of cheese into his burrito, "If I had a restaurant, I would call them constipation burritos because there's so much cheese in them. And no one would disagree with me because they would all be constipated. And I would just sit back and laugh, because, no, I don't have any toilets."  It was the damned funniest thing I think he's ever said. Maybe only surpassed by the time he made me shoot milk out my nose. But I don't remember what comment made me do that, so this is his funniest line to date.
