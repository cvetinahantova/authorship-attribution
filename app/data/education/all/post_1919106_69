So much to do, so little time   At work, we found problems with the networked filesystem. Can't say that I know how to fix that yet. For class, I need to send in that reading assignment I missed. And I need to study for the second psychology test on Tuesday. And I need to prepare the assignments for the systems analysis and design class. And I need to do the readings for philosophy. And I need to think of a thought experiment for that same class.  For gaming, I need to finish my Exalted character. And my Vampire character. And I forgot to ask Jeff about the quick draw thing... And I need to get my door fixed. And get my name changed on Gods know how many records.  And do the laundry. And clean up my room.  *sigh*. Sometimes I wish that time could just stop, and that I could live in the same moment forever and ever. And then reality slaps me in the face and reminds me of my curse... Will I ever be able to settle somewhere? Will I ever be able to say "This is my home, these are my friends, here is where I stay"? I won't let that pull me down though. As long as I get remembered by the good things I left behind I'll be fine.
