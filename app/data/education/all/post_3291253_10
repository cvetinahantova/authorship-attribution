After reading this subversive piece of journalism  urlLink  "DEMOCRATS FOR GUNS" (Ted Rall)  I began to shiver with rage. What would happen when all you stinking democrats vote for Kerry and put him in office? Yes, I have heard from very trustworthy sources, that as soon as Kerry steps in office (something that we must seek to avoid at all costs), he will completely ban the use, breeding and petting of possums. I mean, what the hell is that? It is since the beginning of this great nation that we have been cultivating the art of breeding and training possums for our own enjoyment and protection. Who will protect my kids from potential, possum wielding strangers? We must fight for this right.
