Second day of work--spelndiforous. I'm meeting waaaay too many new people, but at least I feel all official about it. The people are tremendous. I love them already. So much fun. I'm really excited about my SUB students; they are so independent and cool so far. I'm really pumped about my first activity as Student Advisor. I have to be at the comedy night Sunday night. That means I have to supervise so that our comedy guy doesn't light himself on fire. Fun, eh?  I'm being placed in a position with a lot of responsibility. I serve on 10 committees. That's just a fraction of what I have to do. However, it's going to be such a challenge that I'm going to love it. I know I will. I always have loved being stretched to the limit.  I need to get out of the office. It's already almost 5 p.m. That means, I'm staying a 1/2 hour later than I need to. I'm supposed to be looking at an apartment soon. I'll post more later.
