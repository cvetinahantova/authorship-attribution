urlLink Usage of Content in Web-Supported Academic Courses  Librarians and faculty spend a lot of time (and money) making library resources available to students online.  This is particularly true for web supported courses for distance learning students.  Do students actually use this content?  This is a full-text article from  Academic Exchange Quarterly  written by Rafi Nachmias and Limor Segev of Tel-Aviv University in Israel which looks at how students use online content placed on the web for their use in a course.  Abstract:  "The use of the Internet as an instructional tool in higher education is rapidly increasing. We are witnessing the development of huge amounts of learning materials for academic web-sites. Still, there is little empirical evidence regarding the actual use of these contents by students. In this study, computer logs are used in order to evaluate how online contents are consumed, the individual differences among students in terms of contents usage are investigated as are the amount of contents that is presented in courses' web-supported sites. Finally, further implications of information related to content usage are discussed, and their relevance for the evaluation of ICT implementation in higher education institutes is shown."
