Here's Eric Alterman on critics of Paul Krugman:  "It's no accident that it is mostly liberals who tend to inspire this bit of illogic, and nobody does it better than Krugman. The so-called Krugman Truth Squad, led by wannabe Ayatollah Andy Sullivan, succeeds in nothing so much as embarrassing itself with its small-minded obsessiveness about matters that the Princeton by way of Yale, MIT and Stanford economist clearly understands better than they do."  Whether you love or hate Krugman, what an astounding display of elitism.  Krugman is clearly an intelligent and well-educated man, but the two are not the same thing.  One of the worst aspect of the current left is its often sneering disdain for those without Ivied credentials.
