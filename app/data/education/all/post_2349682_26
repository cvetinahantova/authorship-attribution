I was let go today of my nannying job, it's kind of strange. I am happy because Shara wants to become a mom for reals now, and that's the best thing she could do for Brynn. But I am sad because I won't be able to be with Brynn anymore, if I'd of known that I wouldn't be seeing her again I would have given her an extra hug. I don't think that she will be out of my life whatsoever. It's funny because they were trying to find someone to work on Sundays to take care of Brynn, I pretended to cry and said "why do you want to replace me?!" And now she is the only one who gets to take care of Brynn since she is available on Sundays. I hope that she loves Brynn a lot.  I will miss that family, I knew that God put me there for a reason even if it was only for a little while. I will still be in touch with them, maybe invite them to church once in awhile. Lord, I pray that you will be with Brynn and Shara, help Shara learn how to love her little girl like she deserves to be loved. Help Brynn grow up to be an awesome woman of God, and I pray that Shara will become a leader in her house. I give them both up to you to watch and protect, thanks for letting me be apart of their lives for a little while.
