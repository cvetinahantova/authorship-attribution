urlLink Life with Christ: Your Christian blog provider.    I found this web site today while searching for Christ centered Web Logs (Blogs) and this appears to be a very nice one.  Apparently they offer you the ability to have a FREE Blog from their site which is nice.  Since they host Blogs there will probably be a wide variety of blogs to read as well.  The fact that they use RSS also makes me very happy which means I can keep up any new changes via Blog Express.  :)  As far as that goes I have approximately 32 RSS feeds that I keep up with every day.  I LOVE RSS , have I told you that?  LOL....  God bless
