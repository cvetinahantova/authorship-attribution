So yesterday i was with my man right everything was all fine you know and we were over at a friends house (the same one who lets her man control her) well my daughter had a wet diaper so i came home to change her. Well i was smoking and i set my cigerrette outside (no smoking in my house) and i told my boyfriend not to touch it just playing with him, well i went inside figuring he would put it out for me. So later i asked him if he put it out and he yelled at me! It made me rethink our whole relationship. It wouldnt have been such a big deal if he was like most guys but hes not he doesnt yell, shit ive never heard him yell in the two years ive known him, ive never even heard him raise his voice even when he was mad so that got me thinking. I was thinking that if i could get him to yell and we've only been together for two weeks something must be really wrong. So like i said i was thinking about just going back to us being friends but hen i talked to my sister and she was right. She told me that i expect him to be perfect witch is the truth i do. Only because in my eyes he is perfect ive never had a guy that was so  nice and careing, so gentle and loving, yet he knows what he wants. So when he does that (yells) it makes me mad becouse it shows hes not perfect and that hes only human. I dont know im so afraid im going to lose him that maybe im just pushing him away as a defense. One thing i do know is how much i love and care for him. I only hope he feels the same.
