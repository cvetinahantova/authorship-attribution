Sunday Morning  Yesterday, I didn't get any homework done.  But I knew I wouldn't, so I got some movies instead.  I don't know much about movies, or where to look for a good one, so I enlisted the help of some friends, although without their knowledge.  On froyd.net, which is run by Sean Froyd (my roommate), there is a message board.  And on this message board, a group of people that have known eachother since high school are constantly arguing and ridiculing each other.  These people are Bemidji locals, by the way, and are that "second circle of friends" that I mentioned in my very first post.  Anyways, a few of them  do  know about movies, or at least think they do, and occasionally they come out with their own  "best 100 movies" list.  Shane Wahl, whose blog can be accessed to your left, is the ringleader, but it also includes Eric Cole, Nick Auger, and Jake Westrum.  So, I picked movies from their list when I decide its time to watch a movie.  Last night, the winners were "Taxi Driver," and "Fight Club."  Both movies are fantastic, and I definitely recommend them, if you can take come bloody violence.  Their also both male-oriented movies.  More than being a bloody action movie, they are both primarily thought-provoking movies, but you don't need to think to enjoy them.     Tommi  Tommi contacted me this morning, and invited me out to coffee sometime in the near future.  I was happy to accept.  That's all I'm going to say about that, for now.     Work  Its 9:37am right now, and I am looking forward to getting some work done today.  I'm going to make a quick stop at the coffeeshop, then get to work.  Today, I'll be studying for an "Intro to Art" exam, writing a paper on Heidegger's conception of "intentionality," and beginning a paper on how the American philosophy of pragmatism influenced the development of law and the economy of America.  I'm afraid that last one might turn out to be bullshit; not due to lack of effort, but due to a lack of strong influence.
