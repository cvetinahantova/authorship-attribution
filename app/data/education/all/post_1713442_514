urlLink Ensuring Quality and Productivity in Higher Education: An Analysis of Assessment Practices. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest was written by Susan Gates et al.  It looks at assessment practices in higher education.  From the ERIC Digest:  Those responsible for education and professional development within systems such as corporations, state governments, and government agencies are concerned about the quality of those opportunities. As a result, they increasingly assign responsibility for ensuring the quality and productivity of education within the system to one particular office or agency. Often, such agencies receive little guidance about how to approach their task. A RAND research team conducted a broad review of the general literature on the assessment of quality and productivity in education and professional development. The team also reviewed the documentation of organizations engaged in such assessment, interviewed experts, attended conferences, and conducted site visits to exemplary organizations. The ASHE-ERIC Report Vol. 29, No.1, Ensuring Quality and Productivity in Higher Education: An Analysis of Assessment Practices, synthesizes the Rand study findings and provides suggestions for approaches that might be useful for agencies given the task of ensuring the quality and productivity of education and professional development activities in a specific system. This ERIC Digest is based upon ASHE-ERIC Report Vol. 29, No.1, and briefly summarizes the Report highlights.
