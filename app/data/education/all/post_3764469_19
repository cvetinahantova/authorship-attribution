Ok, so Jae and I were chatting yesterday... we've talked about how we should put a sort of weekly theme to this blog in order for people to post. Something that will interest most of the pisay 98 blogging population.  And so, i've been thinking of what would be a good topic to talk about? Incidentally, i'm feeling quite nostalgic today because of  urlLink this song i heard . And my brain is just flooding with high school memories, i just cannot choose!  I could still clearly remember my first days in pisay. My very first time in pisay was during the second screening. Remember how we were assigned to testing rooms alphabetically? Me, being one of people on the end of the list, took my exam in the canteen. Har! Har! Har! Testing date was April 8, 1994.  Enrollment: May 29, 1994. I remember meeting Lorenzo everywhere i go; in the clinic, in the registrar, etc. Of course, we did not really "meet". I don't know him then. "Namukhaan" lang namin ang isa't-isa. So officially, the first person that i met and became my friend was Faye Guerzon.  June 5, 1994, Sunday. I checked in the dorm and met my roommates, first was Monet and later on, Ria and Elena arrived. I still remember I keep calling Elena as "Elaine". Hehehe! We did not "bond" much that night, we went to bed early. Ria set her antique alarm clock (yes, very antique. the one that really goes, "ring ring ring") and put it on her bed side. The alarm clock went off at 4 am and we were all awakened, except Ria. And to think the clock was sitting just beside her ear.  So that was just the start of the year. And the start of the next four years. It's hard to believe that 10 years have passed already. Sigh,  I really miss high school .  Oh, so back to the topic.  What do you think would be a good "theme of the week"?
