I'm always looking for someone to sweep me off my feet.  I want that whole "true love" nonsense.  I was married for two miserable years.  Oh we had our good moments, I would have stayed forever just because I hate the idea of divorce.  He left me for another woman, and far from being devastated, I've been happier ever sense. The real problem is that I throw myself whole heartily into these relationships only to find out that the one I'm with is not quite that into it. So now I'm working on not doing that.  Trying to teach myself to hold back some of that overwhelming passion that makes me think this time he's the one.  Right now it's real easy, there's no one in my life. :)
