There was once a family of four skunks. A mother skunk, a father skunk and two identical twin skunks named Inskunk and Outskunk. their parents named them as such because the only way to tell one fom the other was to keep inskunk inside all the time and Outskunk outside continually except at meal time. When being fed, Inskunk would be inside to eat and when done inskunk would go outside and Outskunk would come in to eat. After eating Outskunk would go back outside and Inskunk would come back in. They followed this ritual daily to avoid confusion. One day mother skunk had to go into town and left father skunk to look after the twins. As she was leaving she reminded him not to mix up the two because the last time it took them a week to sort it out. Father skunk replied, "it is alright dear. I can tell them apart. So Off she went. When lunch time came father skunk let Outskunk in to eat without letting Inskunk outside. Mother came home to see this happen, I cannot believe you let this happen!" "They are mixed up!!" Father skunk replied, "the are not mixed up. This is Inskunk and over here is Outskunk, It is simple. Instincts!!
