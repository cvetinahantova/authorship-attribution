Well, I just got back from a great 24+ hours at my cottage, located up in the ever-beautiful Port Bay, NY.  I spent yesterday afternoon and evening there with my fiance, and it was nice to just be there without the normal chaos of my family.    As I write this now, I am kicking myself for not taking any pictures to post from this beautiful weekend.  Seriously, the weather could NOT have been any better out there on the waters of Lake Ontario.  I was in charge for dinner that evening, and so I got out to the cottage at about 1pm to start my prep so I didn't have to do a lot later.  Once Jamie arrived at about 3pm, we got into our suits and jumped on the boat to go swimming at Chimney Bluffs.  Well I guess I should say that I was the only one whom went swimming, as my beloved is really a large cold-blooded lizard that only lives for laying in the sun to warm her.    I actually managed to read over 200 pages of my book (and wound up finishing it) in a 24 hour period.  The book that I read was  The Lovely Bones , by Alice Sebold, and it was a fantastic read.  It's about a girl whom is raped and murdered by a neighbor and how she observes the lives of her family, friends, and killer as she lives in Heaven.  Look at it as a story about how people cope with the tragic loss of a young person and how lives are virtually ruined and rebuilt.  It's more a story of forgiveness and redemption than anything else, which makes it as powerful as it is original.  This is a book that could have easily gone in the direction of vengeance and justice, a Law & Order show in print if you will, but I'm grateful that Sebold took advantage of her talent and took the reader in a greater direction.  Anyways, it was a very low-stress weekend.  I love the time when Jamie and I get to just exist together.  There isn't anything better than that.
