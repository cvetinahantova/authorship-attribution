I haven't mentioned that some of us went to  urlLink Joseph, Oregon , a couple weekends ago. It's a lovely resort town in the remotest reaches of northeastern Oregon. It's definitely sasquatch territory. Actually, it was Nez Perce territory until the US army drove Chief Joseph, after whom the town is named away.   We were hoping to go on  urlLink a train ride through northeastern Oregon , but the train was out of commission, so we went to  urlLink Jubilee Lake  instead.   After a lovely walk around the lake, we headed down to Joseph, which has become an artists' community. Our friend, the sculptor and painter  urlLink Ray Parmenter , met us there for delicious prime rib. One of his sculptures adorns the main street of Joseph.  We also wandered into Valley Bronze Gallery, where we happy to see that work by our friend  urlLink Lesley Cain  was hanging. The Walla Walla sculptor  urlLink Nano Lopez  was also present there (I recommend his website, by the way!).   In  urlLink Kelly's Gallery , we found the work of our friend  urlLink Monica Stobie , from Dayton. They also had the work of anothe Dayton artist,  urlLink Keith McMasters .
