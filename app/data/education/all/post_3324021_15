We need to keep a strong grip on our student government. You already let Officer Elections slip past you, don't let Senate Elections pass you by too. You need to have a say in your student government, you need to have control. VOTE TOMORROW! VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU, NOT SOMEONE WHO JUST CARES ABOUT COLLEGE APPS! VOTE FOR, YOU KNOW WHO, I CAN'T MENTION THE NAME BECAUSE I'M BEING CENSORED BY THE PERSON MENTIONED IN THE WELCOME NOTE! IF YOU READ THE WELCOME NOTE OR LOOK AT THE LIST OF CANDIDATES POSTED YESTERDAY YOU WILL FIGURE IT OUT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!
