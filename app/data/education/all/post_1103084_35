I stayed home from church with Jaelyn this morning, because we've diagnosed her as having strep throat.  I had it last week.  She has all the regular symptoms, and we were lucky enough to take her to the medi-center where the doctor heard our diagnosis, nodded his head and wrote the prescription.  We decided we loved him.  There's something perverse about the medical system that always forces you through this bueracratic routine with the physician approving or testing etc... before you can make substantial decisions about your own or your children's health care.    One more argument for how the scientific method has weakened our ability to live well -- or free -- or something.    My new best friend (who doesn't actually know it yet, but does he have to in a world of free floating disembodied identities?) Jonny Baker keeps a  urlLink list of worship tricks .  Maybe I'll follow his lead and keep a list of how the scientific method has debilitated us.  I need a catchier title than that, though.   A Litany Protesting Science?   The Anti-Science Thesis?  Where exactly is the Wittenberg door that I can nail this sucker to?
