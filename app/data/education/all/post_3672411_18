Alright, so the mall nearby the FIA office in  urlLink Susono  has this thing with 80's Muzak. Everywhere we walked there was a different instrumental version of an 80's song (all complete with the obligatory saxophone solo). At first I thought they had a random muzak soundtrack on and that it just happened to be a  urlLink Boy George  song but another department had "Rio" going (Duran Duran). Yet another department kept the trend going (can't remember which one now).     Fact of the day: Boy George used to eat at my dad's cousin's old restaurant ( urlLink The Ruins ) in Ocho Rios  Additional fact: "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?" was my Dad's most heavily rotated dishwashing song in the 90's.
