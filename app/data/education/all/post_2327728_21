Alright, can I just say that the phrase "This one time..." was, in fact,  used by people before American Pie came out and totally destroyed legitimate use of it!  Now, I have to be all specific about when and where my stories take place in order to avoid the ridicule that naturally follows when you start a sentence with "This one time...".    Joe wants a party.  He is coming back to Halifax in a couple of weeks in order to write the DAT for application into dentistry.  He told me that I should throw him a party for after the test.  Are you kidding me?  The worst part is that after I mocking him for such an expectation, I then thought twice and started planning a super-secret surprise party for Joe after the DAT.  I am such a sucker.  I swear to god, Joe has the entire universe wrapped around his little finger!  I need to take lessons...
