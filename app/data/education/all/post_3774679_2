Totally stressed out about my packing. The temperature is in the 30's which is far too hot to do anything as far as I am concerned. I find myself in a sort of limbo. I don't really have anything to do but pack and clean but am caught in a circuit of procrastination. Having finished my job and shut down my social life here I'm walking around in a sort of aimless daze. Nothing seems very real at this point. Really hoping it cools down soon because I'm going to have to wear a lot of clothing, at least onto the plane. The shit will hit the fan shortly.
