When we first started the Writing Project, we were told that we were all writers.  We were writers even if   we   didn't think so.    yeah right.   I knew better.  I knew that my worst nightmare was to be placed somewhere where they would make me write.  Give me a prompt, be specific, and tell me what to write.  Don't tell me to be creative and just 'get your thoughts out there!'  gag.  I don't have time right now to finish because we are about to leave the lab, but I just want to let you know (all of you out there who read this.  count = 0 ...lol....) that I am now a writer.  The morning of the 5th day of Writing Project, as I contorted my face and put on my mascara.... I became a writer.
