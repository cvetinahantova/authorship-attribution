Yawn, it's quite early in the morning. I'm not saying that it's ridiculously early but, considering that it's the weekend, it's earlier than I care to be up. For the last couple of days I have been waking extremely early; it isn't fair, it's the weekend! I managed to change my printer ink yesterday, and the new one is working to an extent, although it's a little pale and for some reason printing takes longer than it used to. It will probably settle out soon. I'm going to go back to bed now and have a bit more of a sleep.
