Will I live only to become a statistic?  Well, I guess we are all statistics in one way or another.  I guess it's just depends on what you do in your life and the decisions you make that make becoming a certain statistic more probable.  Hmmmm.  I supposed I'll just leave my fate in the hands of that 'ol 'odds-maker' in the sky.  Love you all!!!  MWAH!
