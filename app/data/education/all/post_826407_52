Church was in the form of two gigs this week,  Stoney at the Fez Club was first on Wednesday.  The act before him was loud and enthusiastic punk with a lead singer like Iggy Pop, very cool.  Mark was excellant - some of his new songs were brilliant.  Then 24 Hour Parking at the deep end at Hillsborough - a great venue.  10th leper were excellant beardrock, quirky misrablecore at its best.   Then Gareth Robinson and band were fantastic all his worship songs without the annoying nice sensibilities they have in church.  The band looked like they were having fun too.  Behind the bar was a screen running some interesting video loops, candles burning, leaves falling etc.  it added to the atmosphere, was the kind of thing I'd seen at alternative worship events- excellant.  Thanks to all who put the gigs on.
