Columbus, GA - Day three in a great town, speaking to 1,200 sixth and seventh grade students a day at the annual "Drug Free You and Me" conference, sponsored by McDonalds.  My mom is here with me for the week, which is a lot of fun.  Plus, speaking at two elementary schools each day has been very rewarding.  However, the Tour du Georgia, a bike race with Lance Armstrong, came through town today, which was exciting to watch.
