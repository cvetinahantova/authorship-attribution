i thought this (http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html) was neat.  i like books.  i want to read them all.  alas there is not enought time in the day.  It is 6:33 in the morning.  I have not slept at all.  i tried.  Nothing.  Nada.  Finally I said screw it.  I'm not gonna lie here like an ass.  I'll get up an type.  I'm gonna head down to Starbucks soon and pump some sweet caffeine into my veins and try to write a story. I'm going to be famous one way or another.  I haven't decided how yet though.  EUROPE PART 3  Billy and I met in the Philadelphia Airport on September 3rd.  I from Michigan, he from Minnesota.  I don't know where the hell he found me, but we ended up going to a bar and having the most expensive beers in the universe.  I swear mine was over eight dollars. Funny thing is, we parted ways the same way, drinking beers, when the trip was over.  I guess it isn't all that weird since we drank a lot of beer on the trip.  Anyways, the bar we drank at when we returned from Europe had a faux 50's decor.  It was Holloween and the waitresses scared me.  By this time, Billy had quit smoking for the 5th time. (A quote from a bar in Brugges, Belgium: "This is my last pack.  If it isn't, there's something wrong with me.")  So when we get into the bar he asks me "What are you gonna think If I ask for a cigarrette?"  Then, he bums one off a guy that just got off from being stationed in Germany. Anyway, I thought it was funny.  My travel account isn't designed to rip on Billy, (although later you will be introduced to a little Swedish mishap which can't help but be told), I will bear my fair share of ridicule along the way as well.  So buckle up. We landed in Amsterdam in the early morning. It was a "We're not in Kansas anymore" experience.  I remember being struck by and odd paralysis.  I just stood there thinking, "What's that?  I haven't seen that before.  What's that say?  Wow, she's hot.  What's that?  I haven't seen that before..."  The newness was startling. Holland was also filled with legions of beautiful women. I have never seen such an awesome collection of stunning females in my life, counting Southern California.  They were stunning, had incredible bodies and they all rode bikes.  Well, everybody rode bikes, but it made the women more alluring.  I was excited.  I was in a land swarming with lusious babes on bikes.  Could it get any better?  All this to say, I never talked to any of them, but they were pretty remarkable nonetheless. In addition to the infestation of bikes, Amsterdam was plagued with trams.  I was scared as hell of getting hit by one of them.  and I never was, so NYAH!!! you stupid tram! Up Yours! When you talk about Amsterdam, all anybody wants to know about is the drugs and the sex.  Yeah, it's there.  I saw it.  Here's a side note, i don't know how related it is to the topic at hand, but here goes: Finding a room in Amsterdam blows.  It blows bigtime.  at least it did for us.  We tried 3 or 4 or 5 different places.  And because we were retarded, we walked everywhere.  We were excited, in a different country, and complete asses.  I had it bad, but Billy.  Oh man, his backpack (if you could call it that) was two of him.  It dwarfed mine.  It was so big, it looked clownish in comparison to other travelers packs.  He was dying as we wandered around the streets, guidebookless, looking for a hostel .  I had no sympathy, I didn't tell him to pack his own personal maid, massuse, concubine, and pediatrician.  We did switch packs for a while though and his pack felt like giving a piggyback ride to rosanne barr in her third tri-mester. We finally found a place to stay in the early afternoon.  It was a Christian youth hostel in a decent part of town with cool looking buildings.  We went out drinking that night.  As we walked back to our hostel, we noticed we were passing a buch of windows lit by red lights.  Ok, whatever.  We turned down the road to our hostel and the windows became more frequent, however it was what was inside the windows that was peculier ï¿½ Half-naked women blowing kisses at us.  Ah, the famed Red-Light District and our hostel was smack dab in the middle of it.
