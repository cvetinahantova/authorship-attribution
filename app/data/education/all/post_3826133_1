After lunch today I decided that Monkeypants was mad at me. Just like that. I just decided that he didn't return my call and therefore must be mad at me. Girls are so strange. Monkeypants is not mad at me, of course. He just got busy and didn't return my call. But why would I decide that he was angry at me and not speaking to me? Monkeypants is not that kind of person; he would sit down and talk to me. He's a wonderful person. It was a completely irrational decision. I jumped from point A to point z32B7.9 with no basis what so ever.   I'm nuts.   And as a bonus: Mom's decided I'm pregnant! Yay mom! Thanks for your vote of confidence!
