The reflection of the streetlights ripple and dance like flames on the surface of the water, while the fountain churns its unending chorus of subtle harmony.  Cars move on the far side of the lake, devoid of sound and soul.  The bats move erraticly above me, diving and shifting and casting their terrible shadows on frightened children...   The lake is on fire with street lights, but something deeper capsizes my attention.  The reason bodies of water are so captivating to me is that they reflect the endless sky.  The sky is amazing because it is truly limitless.  The adage "the sky's the limit" has dulled us into seeing only what appears and has hidden from us that which is real.  Beyond the particles of air that refract the suns light and give us daylight exists undeniable proof of man's inability.  Across heaven's dome lie millions of glowing pinpricks unveiled with the retiring sun; but more prominent, and perhaps less obvious, the blanket of empty space on which they exist.  Eternal unending nothingness from which our eyes can only gather nonexistence.  How unfathomable to the skeptic who must see to believe!  What must go through the mind of a man who determines truth by his ability to comprehend.
