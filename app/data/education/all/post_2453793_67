yay!  i have a new wardrobe!!  i went shopping today and bought a bunch of new clothes.  i figured it was time...after wearing the same 3 pairs of pants over and over again every day this winter.  i can't believe how enjoyable it was to go shopping this time.  usually it's really quite depressing and i end up crying in the fitting rooms because nothing fits right.  this time, everything seemed to fit perfectly...i even found jeans that fit me (which is unbelievable).  i can't wait to wear something new to school on monday!  i'm scared for this week to come.  supposedly we'll know which teachers aren't coming back next year because of the budget cuts by the end of the week (right before our spring break).  at first i wasn't worried about my position because we have someone retiring in our department.  however, we just received the enrollment numbers and math is down quite a bit, which means technically they can get rid of 2 teachers in our department...and i'm the newest one and only one of two who aren't tenured yet.  i also didn't know that they were cutting 22 teachers this year in the district.  ugh...at least i have an updated resume.  too bad their aren't many math openings posted yet.  well, i'm crossing my fingers that i don't get bad news...  i have a feeling that i'm going to find someone soon.  meaning someone that is interested in me and who i might start dating.  so far i don't think i've met this person.  it's really sort of a bizarre feeling.  i wonder if i'm right or if i'm just a wishful thinker.  i guess we'll see...  well, i think i'm going to head to bed.  i'm really not all that tired but i know i need to catch up on sleep and i have a lot to do tomorrow.  so, goodnight, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite!  :)
