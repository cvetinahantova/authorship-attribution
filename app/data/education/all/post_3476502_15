Music: My Immortal - Evanescence Mood: depressed *****************  >.>... my life sucks... my mom has (stupidly) decided that after she gets things going when she gets a job, she's going to go to law skool part time... she's always doing this shit... never thinking about other people around her, always her, her, her! THIS IS ONE REASON WHY I DIDN'T COME HOME LAST SUMMER!!! She never thinks "Hmmm, maybe my daughter will need some money to start out with, so maybe I should help her get a car, so she can have a job, so she won't live at home all her fucking life!!!!!" NO SHE'LL JUST FUCKING GO "I'LL GO TO FUCKING LAW SKOOL AND FUCK UP THE REST OF MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE, AND CAUSE MY PARENTS TO GIVE ME MONEY, SO MY DAUGHTER CAN'T GET A CAR AND CAN'T GET A JOB, AND SHE'LL BE POOR AND MISRIBLE ALL HER FUCKING LIFE!!!!!AND I CAN'T TAKE HER BECAUSE I'M TOO FUCKING LAZY TO GET MY FAT ASS UP OFF THE FUCKING COUCH TO TAKE HER TO WORK!!! OR LET HER TAKE THE FUCKING CAR, BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE TO GO GET SOME CIGERETTES, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME!!!" WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING THROUGH THAT DRUNKEN BITCH'S MIND!??!?!! SHE'S ONLY CARED ABOUT HER SELF!!! I'VE NEVER BEEN GREEDY, UNLIKE MY FUCKING BROTHERS!!! I'VE NEVER ASKED HER FOR FUCKING 20 BUCKS EVERY DAY!!!! NO! I NEVER DID!! I SOLD MY THINGS, DID CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE, SAVED LUNCH MONEY TO GET MONEY TO GO DO THINGS!!!! I THINK IT'S TIME I GET SOME COMPENTATION FOR ALL THE SHIT I'VE BEEN THROUGH!!! I DESERVE TO BE PAYED BACK FOR ALL THE SHIT I'VE PUT UP WITH THIS FUCKING FAMILY!! I COULD BE LIVING BETTER AT THE FUCKING BOYS AND GIRLS HARBOR!!! FUCK!!! WHY CAN'T I BE CUT A FUCKING BREAK IN LIFE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!   *ahem* sorry... I've had that one my chest for a while now... I had to get it out... I'm going to go sit in a dark corner and cry now... ::turns up evanescence and puts on away message:: ...bye...
