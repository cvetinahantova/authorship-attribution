i just watched Freddy VS Jason... that had to have been the worst movie i have ever seen. (well.. Kill Bill Vol 1 still wins the number one spot in my personal opinion..) for those of you who haven't seen these awesomely evil monsters battle it out let me set up the first post murder scene.. 4 teenagers (3 girls and a guy) are screaming and yelling "help us" in the front yard and street and the first car that comes up is a police car (how convenient) anyway.. seeing the freaked out girls in the street one of which is in nothing but a towel and covered in blood he rolls the window down and says "do you girls need some assistance?"... that screams CHANGE THE CHANNEL  but no.. i watched it anyway.. before anyone died i told john my guess as to the order of who would die and who would live.. it was too easy..    it definetely should have appealed to the male audience.. boobs, sex, and gore. unless he's an intellectual and he's looking for a more stimulating movie then this... or gay... i feel that i may be offending anyone who enjoyed this movie and for that i'm sorry. feel free to leave any angry comments you may have. i will then feel free to review them and delete them lol.    sometimes the man puts his who who dilly in a woman's cha cha... South Park is more awesome then Freddy VS Jason... at least it's educational.
