.......................... technology is sexy ..........................  what is meant by that word anyway? (sexy)  i'm reading:    urlLink     love the overall tone and direction of what she's saying -- i object to many of Ellul's critiques & Postman's logocentric thinking...  BUT she writes about the slippage of meaning in words and how they mask things more than they mean things--  she offers the example of the phrase "user friendly" -- it masks the meaning of friendship far more than it means  a machine which is easy to use.  but this word -- sexy.  could a word possibly slip farther from its origin of meaning.  and at the same time mean exactly the same thing as it always has.   i use it a lot. I call a lot of things "sexy."  i want to continually make people think about their bodies and desire and how their bodies and desire do and don't matter in the virtual world.   metaphors are like terrorist bombs in the hands of hyperbolists.
