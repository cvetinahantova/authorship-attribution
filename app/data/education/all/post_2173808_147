Given that I am on this blog only at the sufferance of Mr. Polysigh, I have to take exception to his rousing defense of Iowa against the coastal elites. Some day, I'd like to grow up to be one of those coastal elites, so---watch it! Seriously, I do think that there is a point here--Iowans ARE smug about their role in the national political process (as are New Hampshire residents, but at least New Hampshire has places to ski). And that role does have serious effects on national policy outcomes, in particular skewing agricultural policy toward continued, irrational, regressive (in the sense of keeping prices up when the poor spend a disproportionate percentage of their income on food) subsidization. If Iowa is going to continue to hold the rest of the country hostage to their policy preferences through the presidential nomination process, they should at least feel guilty about it.  And as to "give me Davenport any day"...as someone who grew up and went to college in the DC area, I say, "better dead than white bread!"
