urlLink Serving Students with Disabilities at the Community College. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Mary Prentice.  It shows ways that disabled students can be better served at community colleges.  From the ERIC Digest:  People with disabilities make up the single largest minority group in the United States. Over the past ten years the traditional profile of disabled persons as older, poorer, less educated and less likely to be employed has begun to change. This is due in part to a "dramatic increase" in the number of students with disabilities who are seeking higher education (Smith, 1998). This increase is attributed to, among other things, enhanced technology, expanded support service programs, and higher expectations of what students with disabilities can accomplish. A majority of these students have turned to two-year colleges for their educational needs; of the students with disabilities in higher education institutions in 1997-1998, fifty-five percent were enrolled in community colleges (Lewis and Ferris, 1999).   To begin serving students with disabilities, college personnel must require documentation of the disability so that appropriate services can be arranged. Once a student has indicated that he or she may need assistance, an assortment of curricular, pedagogical, and technological services can be offered in a variety of configurations. Norris and Vasquez (1998) and Smith (1998) detail these services as follows:   * Curricular: special course groupings and faculty training on strategies that faculty can use to integrate students with disabilities into their classrooms.   * Pedagogical: providing oral testing, tutors, sign language interpreters, readers, note-takers, and extended testing time   * Technological: books on tape, assistive computer technology, tape recorders, and magnifying devices.
