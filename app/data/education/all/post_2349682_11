I was thinking today as I said goodbye to the kids at my internship of how Jesus must of loved and cared for the kids. Ms. Denne my teacher told the kids that this was going to be my final day. All the kids came around me and started to hug me, saying goodbye, and that they will miss me. I was thinking for a brief moment, oh no is this ok, can I let them hug me? But I was like this is how they are showing their affection, I don't care what happens I am going to let these kids love on me because I care about each and every one. They all started saying that they love me and are going to miss me, one said I will miss you but I'm not going to be sad. I said, I will! I almost cried because two of the little boys where trying to lock me with pretend handcuffs so that I wouldn't go away. How precious is that?! I was totally blessed by the kids, I am so glad that I went back.
