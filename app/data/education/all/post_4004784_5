I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get this frickin thing to let me post. then i was like - well, i can ask them... but oh.... that would require posting.... doh!  it was not one of my brightest moments... so here's a question - is there a super easy way to post htat im missing?! annnnd now that i signed up and all that jazz how do i get back to this site?! (hmmm another one of those questions... maybe someone can email me this answer?!) I HAD SO MUCH FUN THIS WEEKEND WITH YOU GUYS! Thank you so much caddie for spearheading it all - and thanks for my spraks for being hostessesses with the mostessessess.  ok best get ready for class.... damn midterms. love u all! kris
