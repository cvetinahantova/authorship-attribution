French Toast   I saw  The Count of Montecristo  last night, and seems that Jim Caviezel will be able to make a career out of  urlLink shaggy   urlLink beards and earnest intonations .  But more importantly, I honestly enjoyed the movie.   urlLink Luis Guzman  cemented his title as my favorite actor of all time, and I was reminded why, exactly, I am on this quest to find the great genre novel.  This adventure stuff is just fun and I don't see why it seems to definitionally come at the expense of character and good prose (or, why it has consistently done so for the past century.)  I also decided that if ever I have an opportunity to include in my own writing a death duel that results in mercy and lifelong companionsip, then I will.  Also, treasure maps.
