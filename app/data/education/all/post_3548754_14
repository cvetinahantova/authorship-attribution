It's already 1pm...I'm still here in the office!!! Waaaah! 5 more hours...or more maybe, until Myk actually arrives. It's his last seminar day for the Continuing Legal Education thingy.  I'm starting to have a headache. It's so gloomy outside. I wanna go home and sleep. Was checking my email when I saw Nyree's(co - w@wie)post. Clicked the link to her blog..hmm...a begginer also. Lemme try..hehehe. Might as well post something for June 1st since it was our anniv. Hmm..I think i'll get addicted to this. Hehehehe.  Showed Myk the PALakbayan packages last night in class (between reporting). He picked a package (that was fast). Told me to book it already, I said I'd do it today.  Class ended early, thank God.Went back to Pateros, it's his cousin's, Enny's 22nd birthday dinner. Good food! Mark, Myk's other cousin, came back from the US 3 days ago. By 11pm, I'm getting really sleepy. Time to go home.
