Whenever I watch  Pulp Fiction , which I was doing instead of work earlier at the office, I end up craving for burgers and milkshakes. I'm not really fond of hamburgers, and I only usually eat burgers at Jollibee and Burger King. Fortunately for me, Jollibee also serves yummy milkshakes, and I won't have to pay 5 dollars for them.  Which reminds me of an idea I had earlier during the scene at Jack Rabbit Slim's, the Americana restaurant where Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace dined. I was thinking about how it would be cool to have a similar Pinoy restaurant, but this one celebrating Pinoy popular culture from the '80s instead.   And then I had to repress a loud chuckle when I realized that if you dined at that restaurant, there's a fairly good chance that the waiter who introduces himself as Chuckie Dreyfuss to serve you is *actually* Chuckie Dreyfuss himself.
