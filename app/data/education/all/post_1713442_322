urlLink Michigan Library Association Annual Conference 2004  If you are in the Midwest of the USA, you may wish to consider attending the MLA Annual Conference in Traverse City, Michigan in October this year.  Traverse City is a great conference city!  And the preliminary schedule looks pretty good.  I am part of a panel giving a pre-conference on publishing for librarians.  One neat activity is the Librarian on the Loose.   The doll being circulated is of course the famous librarian doll that made all the controversy last year.  From the site:  The MLA Auction Committee is sending a Librarian Action Figure on a Summer tour of Michigan! She will spend the Summer touring Michigan towns and libraries, having her picture taken at each stop.  At the end of her journey she will then be auctioned off, with a photo album of her trip, at the MLA Annual Conference at the Grand Traverse Resort in Traverse City, October 26-29, 2004.
