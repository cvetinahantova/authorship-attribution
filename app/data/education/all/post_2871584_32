Today was an errand day.  Nothing terribly exciting.  I went out to do some pricing for the Children's Arts Festival that I'm organizing, and to pick up a few other things at the store.  Since I had nothing else pressing to do, I wandered around the other stores at Riverside Mall, and in doing so found... my new favorite store.  Linens N Things.    I have never been in a Linens N Things store before, but I am sure I will be returning soon.  Despite the fact that I don't really *need* anything for my apartment right now, I easily could have spent hundreds of dollars in there today, no questions asked.  Thankfully for my bank account, I walked out with only one bag.  I also left with enough ideas for my apartment to keep me going for months.  I can quickly see this becoming a very dangerous store for me...  In the meantime, I'm quite proud of myself (and a little scared) that I have already begun working on Christmas projects for this year.  If I keep this up, I'll be done with my Christmas shopping before my birthday rolls around.  Yeah.  That's pretty weird.
