Question #2  What is your theory of learning? From your perspective, how do people learn?    My theory of learning....  I believe all students can learn.  No matter how large or small the concept or task, students can learn.  The nature of humans is to learn...through touch, sight, hearing, smelling, etc.  It is our job as teachers to tap into the particular avenue of learning that is best suited for our students.  How do people learn??  All people learn differently.  It is my belief that no one person learns the same way.  We may share similar styles of learning and similar preferences for learning, but the actual learning process is completely individual.  As a teacher, it is my responsibility to make sure that I provide my students with numerous avenues of learning.  By incoporating different teaching methods, I can address particular learning styles which can aide in the learning process.  I then have to determine if my students have completed the learning process by evaluating them.
