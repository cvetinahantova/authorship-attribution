Well, it is morning, and things aren't any better.  This morning Tommy told me everytime he sleeps, he sees me screwing someone else.  OF course his words were more colorful than mine.  But still you get the message.  I have never cheated on him, never, and I never will.  Man he is soooo ticked about the money.  If our marriage survives this, it will be stronger than strong.    A bit of joy though, I am keeping Savannah and EJ today.  She always makes me smile.  Even when she is grouchy, she makes me smile.  She couldn't understand this morning why uncle Tommy takes his medicine by mouth, she thought he should but it in his button.  Too funny.
