the depressing stories. once, twice,  you're pushing my patience buttons and it works.  But start feeling trigger happy by going the distance for four and so on, you're really asking for ... what? applause? limelights? some validation of your already pathetic existence on earth?   Perhaps i'm not being understanding here.  rude and callous, i know i can see it from my words. But i beg you to just be still for my  sanity, for our friendship, for troubled lives that charge through the lines  and demand nothing more of the silence. This is not a vacuum of  revolution you must fill  but a quiet movement  in this present that no one really understands.
