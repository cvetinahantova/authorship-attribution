Once you received your adult ID, please put down what you have learnt from school. Welcome to the adulthood. Time for you to pick up another set of rules.  No matter how brilliant the history was, history IS history. Try your very best not to be annoyed. No matter how stupid the rules are, rules ARE rules. You just follow it. Save the energy for arguing against them. At least when you deal with the HK government.
