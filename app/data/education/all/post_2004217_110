Phew! What a hectic couple of days that was. I went swimming in the morning for the first time in ages, it was really refreshing and am considering making a habit of it. I returned home for a leisurely afternoon of internet, Jaffa Cakes and webcomics, before all manner of chaos occurred outside as Dad arrived to collect me just as my mum returned home with Rod and a new table top for the dining room. Dad was "helpful" and carried the table top up with Rod, meaning that he was in THE FLAT, with MUM and ME, and it was all very, very odd. I finally managed to extract Dad from the flat and we headed off to the speedway, and then to Bournville for Kat's "my parents are in Wales" house party. I consumed excessive amounts of alcohol and attempted to smoke but failed, before heading up to bed at about 3.30am with Kris and Vez to share the double bed in the spare room. I woke up far too early and then at midday we went into Birmingham before I had to dash home, grab Laura's birthday present and dash back out again to Walsall to meet aforementioned Laura, Selina Debbs and Becky for drinks and exchange and discussion of presents. Early night for Ceffy tonight, methinks!     Sam and Sean were at the party last night, but they had to leave early because they have parents who are sensible. Sam and I seem to be really good friends at the moment, which is cool because we seem to really be just friends; there's no underlying sexual tension between us, we can chat and flirt a little and it's all in good fun, which is ace. Just what I need. Sean's different, he's still making me think, and I don't know if that's good or bad. But still, he's ace too. *grin*     Ceff x      I'm having trouble saying what I mean, with dead poets and drum machines
