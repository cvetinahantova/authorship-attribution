IM GETTING AN UPGRADE UPGRADE   UPGRADE  !!!!!!!! GREATNESS. My mother is on the phone to T-Mobile now. I would like one on the Contract I'm on now, and with a lovely camera that takes the randomest of photos, coz thats what I do on Sumbal's phone.  I take the oddest of photos. Cars. Letter-Boxes  They make great pics together. Ive got loads of pictures on my computer, either scanned in or uploaded from my crappy digital camera which takes very pixelated photos, and it can't do close-up, only long-distance :(
