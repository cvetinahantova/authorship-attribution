It is almost half past four in the morning. I can't get to sleep. I am tormented by visions of handicrafts  -  no, really. First I was thinking about whether or not I should order yarn online, then I was considering possible uses for the pretty woven wire I made whilst watching television. Then I wondered where I could buy more wire to weave and mused for a time on the benefits of magnetic catches. God, it's a sickness.  Now I am online looking at the  urlLink Walsh tools  website, which is like jewellers' porn. Hexagonal triplet loupes, standard pendant motors ... oh yes.  Sweet Jesus, the birds have just started dawn chorusing. I didn't know there  were  birds in New Cross.  In other news, the boy staggered in at half two this morning, almost entirely incoherent. Where the hell did  urlLink you   urlLink lot   go ? I tentatively asked what he ate for dinner and he replied '... vomit'. Oh dear.  Ah well, another thirty five minutes and I can listen to that amazing Danny Boy medley on Radio 4. Yay!*  * I know.
