It's been a while since I've posted again, but I've been busy, so give me a break.  School ends on Tuesday and I'll be glad to be rid of those little heathens.  Well, not really, but they are getting more and more antsy as the year drags on.  I got a big article in the Current about Key Club so now I'm famous at school.    I got a job as a waitress for the summer.  This should be interesting -- I've never waitressed before!  I watched that movie "Babe" this weekend.  Yes, the one with the pig.  It brought back so many high school memories, like all of the girls saying, "A TRAGIC DAY" in that weird voice we used to do.  I miss high school sometimes.  Back then I didn't have to worry about work, rent, money, or my dad being sick.  Then again, if you hooked up with someone and you didn't end up going out with them, you were a slut.  Big negative.  I talked to my ex-boyfriend from college's college roommate for about a half hour today.  He was pretty nice...  I guess I have to change my thoughts about ex-Theta Chi/Sigma Tau Gamma's.  I didn't tell him who I was right away.  He was like, Did you ever hang out with any of my brothers?  I was like, I went out with one of them freshman year.  At that point, I didn't realize that he had roomed with Gary for 3 years.  I often wonder about Gary -- where he is, what he's doing.  I tried to Google him but it wasn't very successful.  I cared about him a lot and would have liked to remain friends with him, but I guess that didn't happen.  Oh well.  I wonder if Kyle will tell the Ayatollah that he talked to me...  I didn't ask Kyle how Gary was, I didn't want it to seem like a fact-finding mission.  I immed him because he looked familiar.  Anyway...  nothing else to report.
