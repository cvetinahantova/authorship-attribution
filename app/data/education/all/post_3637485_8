I received a phone call this week from my mother.  I found this rather odd because she is not the one to do the calling, you must contact her, well unless she wants something.    First off she wanted to inform me that she has be given a promotion to a larger post office. Great now she controls more people.  She also informed me that the local once a week paper in that town ran a front page article on her and her new position and how there was a few sentences about me in there. Stop the presses...what do I have to do with this?   It also was to my surprise that she also wanted to inform me she was going to Dallas.  This seemed like normal news to me because she travels a lot due to her position with the post office. She is not only a post master but also leads the state audit team and has to travel a great deal to workshops and do perform audits.  The punch line came after she informed me of her destination.  "No one from works knows where I am going"  "What?", I replied.  The she went for the kill. "I have been asked to speak at the annual Mary Kay Convention." I had to hold the tears back because I knew this was important to her and I try not be mean to her, although she use to love to stomp on my dreams I try never to sink to her level. So I gasped for air and asked, "congratulations! What are you speaking about?" She said, "I have no idea but they called me and I am the top performer for my region and asked me to speak".  I should be happy for her because she was so excited but all I kept thinking was, you are missing work to talk about make-up? I guess my biggest fear in this whole conversation is that overlords of MK have given her more power and recognition and there will be no end to her reign of terror by make-up.
