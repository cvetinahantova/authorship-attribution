i have sarah mclachlan's single (fallen) in my head right now.  it really seems to cry out everything i'm feeling right now.  i feel like i have fallen with nowhere left to turn and all of the people i thought were friends have decided i'm not worth having around.  the worst part is that there isn't anything i can do to redeem myself.  i wonder how long the boys will stay mad at me.  i wonder if they will ever forgive me.  i won't let myself hold a grudge against them and i hope that they find it in their hearts to look past all the bad things that have happened and forgive me.  i wish i could take back everything...go back in time and change the outcome of things.  i would do so many things differently.  i really didn't want to leave with things like this.  i wanted things to be fixed before i left.  time is running out.  i'm afraid of what's to come...
