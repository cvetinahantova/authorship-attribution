#2 son had a baseball game tonight.  He started the game as pitcher.  Pitched 3 innings of no-hit ball.  Awesome huh?  He is depressed because he can't get a hit.  He wants to hit the ball so bad he can taste it.  He is pushing too hard.  As far as playing the field goes, he is one of the best players and is  the  best pitcher, but he can't get that hit and it bugs him.  What can I do?
