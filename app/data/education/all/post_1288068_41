Please accept my apologies for my rather maudlin postings of late. There is no excuse.  I have only just woken up. At 12.07pm! Truly I am the queen of decadence!   After my afternoon bath and flatmess stressathon, I am off into town to get tickets for  urlLink Beautiful and Damned  which looks like the inside of my mind made flesh. I suspect this will not help my retro fantasy leanings.  Right then.  Take care.
