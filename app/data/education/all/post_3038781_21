Thinking of online Classes?    Think twice. At least before signing up for UOP's courses....Please. Mind you, I'm really enjoying the courses... And seem to be pulling the grades fairly well [my cumm. GPA is 3.66 at the moment] but sooo much of the work is related through online team assignments and I seem to be running hit and miss with team selection. My last team was actually willing to communicate in an active manner and through real time discussions, but this team.... is almost a no go. I'm soooo frustrated I could scream when I read some of the messages.    Monday, one of my team mates posted his own response as a team response to a team question, then yesterday that he thought it was an individual assignment.... but that doesn't explain why the header of his post was labeled Team DQ, and two of his posts prior to this acknowledged that fact. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Aaaggh.    Please, Please, Please ,  if you are thinking of online courses   and lack commitment or like mind games  -   Think twice  about UOP  and sign up elsewhere . I'll even make it a bit easier...
