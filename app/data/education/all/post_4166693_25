Sitting here at work killing time while my boss, Paul, is off doing something highly important in the Student Life field. I feel the need to be doing some important, however, I am posting here on my blog. Maybe it's important to some people. I did get to pick out office supplies today! Hooray for that. I love,   LOVE  , office supplies. I love looking at them. I love touching them. I adore buying them.  I am such a nerd.  I need to go home and grab some lunch, actually. It's a good plan. Whether or not I follow through right now has yet to be determined.  Hmmm....  My boss has a meeting at 1 p.m., and Katie, the support staff, will be downstairs at the front desk, so I'll be all alone in my little room of doom. I wish I'd brought my desk decorations. I could have been doing something constructive with those. Note for tomorrow--bring desk decoration and files. Yeah.  I'm turning into a boring girl. I'll post something important soon. I promise.
