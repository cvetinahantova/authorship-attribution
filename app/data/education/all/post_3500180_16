Right... so this is the pre-exams period (even though I already had two of my exams already -_-, but they are not during the  official  exam week, so I guess it doesn't really count), the fateful time that decides whether you shall proceed to the next level of education or not. This is when I start to freak out because my incredibly lazy self does not want to study, so I procrastinate, and procrastinate, and procrastinate until I realize how screwed I because I didn't study for any of my exams at all. Great, eh? ¬_¬...  Anyways, I have two exams tomorrow: Band and English. Band exam shouldn't be difficult, so I'm not that worried about that. And English, well, you can't really study for that, can you...? So I'm good for today. There won't be any last-minute-late-night cramming tonight, which is good :). Hmm, next week, four exams (in order): French, Science, Geography, and Business. W00t! No math exam! Me got exempted! Hehee. Not that I don't like math or anything, I love math. It's just one less thing to study for. I sound so pathetic... -_-  Maybe I should start studying right now? I dunno, I'm such a lazy bum.. >_  Dinner time........................
