That's it then. Over. Done. I am 'Miss H' no more. No longer a teacher. Hmmm. It's been an emotional drain of a day. Right now I'm torn between relaxing and getting very drunk. I think relaxing will win. I abandoned my untidy desk completely because I just had to get home AND RELAX: it's been a long week. Only 6 of my tutor group managed to make it in today, which is laughable. I was given another sweet little pot-plant as a present from one of my pupils; then we watched the final assembly which, although very long, was great. So much creativity. I cried at the end when my leaving announcement was made and I was absolutely thrilled by the cheering I received (which, rather than them cheering that you're leaving, is the way the school show how much they love you).  There was screaming and stamping on the floors, which made my heart swell.  Then I cried some more when students came to hug me goodbye and cried again during my final briefing. Carol said some truly wonderful things about me.  I think it's only when you leave somewhere you can reflect on it and realise how much it's meant to you.  I made a speech which got a few good laughs and was given a lovely silver bracelet which I was thrilled with. It's a lovely memento.  Then I cried some more, because despite all the hard times the school has given me, it's given me a whole host of wonderful memories and it really has felt at times like one large family. It was such a shame that Colin, Chris, Matt, Justine and dear Marcelle weren't there. I will miss everyone dearly. Now I feel very tired. It's such a lot of people to say goodbye to all in one go. I feel quite empty and almost meaningless. I hate the fact also that I'm technically unemployed. I don't quite know who I am at the moment. Maybe I should start calling myself a writer. Or maybe I should stop defining myself by a profession and just be me for a change: a 24 year old woman with her whole life ahead of her. And onwards to the London adventure.
