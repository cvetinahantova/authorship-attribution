Finally an original movie.  This film is full of purity, honesty, innocence, hope, passion, and of course jealousy and fear of the unknown.  It shows us who Americans truly are versus who we wish to be.  Victor, played by Tom Hanks, gives true meaning to the word innocence.  There is not an evil bone in this man's body.  Throughout the whole film, you laugh with him, cry with him, hope with him.  He has everything taken away from him, yet he does not break.  He stays true to his ethics.  To his being.  He has true love for humanity, and that never fades no matter how hard the corrupt try to rip it away from him.  He does all of this to keep a promise.    I wish there were more Victor's in the world.  I wish we could have a world like the one he lives in.  I wish people could see others the way he sees them.  Instead, we have more of the corrupt. More of the people who fear those like Victor.  They don't fear him because they dislike him or his morals.  They fear him because they don't understand him.  They can't fathom why he's so pure.  They can't even come close to knowing who he is, or what he is about.  Purity.  Honesty.  Innocence.  Hope.  That is what we are all missing.  That is what we need in order to fill the void we feel in our lives.  The question is: now that I have figured out what we need, how do we gain it?
