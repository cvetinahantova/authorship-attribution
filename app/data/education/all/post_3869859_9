I'm feeling quite like this at the moment. It's sometime in July, and I forgot that she was leaving. I fell gently, but she caught me before I reached the ground.     By Dar Williams    The summer ends and we wonder where we are    And there you go, my friends, with your boxes in your car    And you both look so young    And last night was hard, you said    You packed up every room    And then you cried and went to bed    But today you closed the door and said    "We have to get a move on.    It's just that time of year when we push ourselves ahead,    We push ourselves ahead."      And it was cloudy in the morning    And it rained as you drove away    And the same things looked different    It's the end of the summer    It's the end of the summer,    When you move to another place      And I feel like the neighbor's girl who will never be the same    She walked alone all spring,    She had a boyfriend when the summer came    And he gave her flowers in a lightning storm    They disappeared at night in green fields of silver corn    And sometime in July she just forgot that he was leaving    So when the fields were dying, she held on to his sleeves    She held on to his sleeves      And she doesn't want to let go    'Cause she won't know what she's up against    The classrooms and the smart girls    It's the end of the summer    It's the end of the summer    When you hang your flowers up to dry
