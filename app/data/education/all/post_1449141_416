urlLink The Seattle Times: The nation's debt is the GOP's bounty    President Bush likes to talk about the need for "fiscal sanity in Washington." His decision to run up the national debt is entirely sane ï¿½ as long as you understand his real purpose.   Bush doesn't care a whit about deficits. That's because he is not a fiscal conservative. He is a political conservative out to buy himself a majority in 2004 and spending the next generation's money to do it.
