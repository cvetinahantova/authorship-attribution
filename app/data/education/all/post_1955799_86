I wasn't going to write today, since I have so tired, but after sufin' the net a little, I decided to get off my lazy duff and write something.  I should forewarn that I may skip Fridays, and some Saturdays for personal reasons.  Really, on those days if I touch the computer and go online, I just may have to write, but on those days I'm resting from work and classes.  I don't wanna see a damn machine.  Yesterday, a co-worker said she had to go home 'cause she left her dog in the house.  I suppose if a rainbow had hit the sky she might have to leave us today.  Alas, no rainbow, no retreat.  The libray is obnoxiously silent.  It's too quiet.  The only real sound I hear is the tapping of the keys.  I wondering if I'm typing too loud for the patrons?  Circulation is almost capable of running itself when it's this inactive.  All I do is answer questions about times open/close, and computer lab locations.  Phone hasn't rung in a while.  I take it that's good.  Took a test today in my computer graphics class.  I still think multiple choice is a bad way to desmostrate knowledge of software.  Weshould have projects to complete, and be judged on that, but I got an "A," so I shan't bitch too much about that.
