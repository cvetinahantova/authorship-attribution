urlLink AlterNet: Living In a Kleptocrat Nation    By Jim Hightower, Texas Observer August 21, 2003  kleptocrat nation (klep toe krat nay shun), n. 1. a body of people ruled by thieves. 2. a government characterized by the practice of transferring money and power from the many to the few. 3. a ruling class of moneyed elites that usurps liberty, justice, sovereignty, and other democratic rights from the people. 4. the USA in 2003.    The Kleptocrats have taken over. Look at America's leadership today ï¿½ not just political, but corporate, too. Tell me you wouldn't trade the whole mess of them for one good kindergarten teacher.    Forget George W. for a moment and sneak a peek at practically any big-deal CEO, congressional heavy, media baron, talk-show yakker, pompadoured TV preacher, or any the other pushers of America's new ethic of grab-it-and-go greed. In a crunch, would you want to be tied at the waist to any of them?
