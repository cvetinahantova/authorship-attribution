well, sometimes the drive is long and the stars start to speak to me, none too easily, mind you.  whether it's the night, or the mood, or a stillness, or a breeze in the all-too-california trees, there's someting that reminds me of a place i've been before.  i don't know if it's down the road or next door, but it's a comfortable place that is a needed break from this hurricane mind storm that's been hanging around.  i try not to venture downtown among whoknowswhat and the shops and stores and nooks and crannies frequented by freaks and someone's grandma.  and it's dirty down there.  when i walk in, everybody stares and me like i got something to say.  "why me?!"  i shout.  "what did i do to deserve all this attention?"  i didn't even ask for it....well, i did.  when i was six.  i made a promise to God and He won't let me give it up, even though i've forgotten what it is.   but i've got a hint.  it's like the lyrics to an all-too-familiar song, where you've forgotten all the words and the name of the band, but you still know that if you heard it on the radio, you'd get emotional.  that's the rand mcnally of my life right now.  that's the rest area in topeka that i'm stuck at, my friends.  there are too many familiar faces among the truckers that could be you or you or me.  but i don't drive a truck down a lonesome road.  or i suppose maybe i do.  it's slow.  and it gets me nowhere.  and the faster i drive the slower i go.  so maybe someday ill give up driving altogether.  i'll just park it on the side of the road, walk out in a field and wait for stormy weather.  because when that lightning lights up the sky, i know where it came from.  no, fortunatly wasn't from my bedroom, but you're not too far off.
