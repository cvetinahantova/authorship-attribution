Why is it that the people who I want to e-mail me never do and the people who I don't really want to hear from are constantly sending me forwards and mass e-mails about trivial events?  It is frustrating to log on and just be looking for one e-mail address to appear in my inbox and never to see it.  My life is like this with phone calls as well.  I suppose I do get phone calls from people I love and care about, but the few people who I really wish would call me just see to have me erased from their memories.  I'm therefore stuck trying to keep myself from calling that person.  I actually deleted a guy's number from my cell phone because I was scared that I would keep calling him and appear to be a sad, desperate female in need of attention when really I just wanted to talk to the guy.  And of course, he doesn't call.  Sigh.  I'm pretty much over it now, at least compared to how much I wanted to hear from this guy before, but sometimes, usually when I am driving home late I night, I still have to restrain myself from searching for his phone number and dialing it up.  Life is like that.  I am happy that my real life (school) will start up again soon so that once more I can become engrossed with all of the craziness that it entails and become unaware of what is going on in most of the rest of the world.  I know that I shouldn't want to shut myself off from the world, but when I teach that is what happens.  I find that by teaching children who pretty much live in a ghetto I lose some of my social skills and end up feeling awkward in situations involving groups of people.  I get almost downright giddy and have to contain my enthusiasm.  Maybe I just need some drugs.  We put our children on them and expect them to behave - perhaps I would behave too if I was on a mood-altering drug.
