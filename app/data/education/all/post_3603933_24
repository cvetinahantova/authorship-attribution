What did you do for the fourth of July?  Kyle and I were not good patriotic Americans.  We didn't watch the fireworks, we didn't wear red, white, and blue - we went smimming and ordered pizza in our hotel room.  It was very fun.  We went to Chicago for the weekend to celebrate our 2nd anniversary.  We have a goal that by our 50th anniversary we will have spent one anniversary in each state.  So far we have hit Hawaii (honeymoon), Virginia (last year Virginia Beach) and now Illinios.  Next year I am thinking either Montana, Iowa, or Kentucky.  We've gotta hit them sometime, and I want something other than big city.    Chicago was cool.  We did Ikea.  I would never have imagined how many people would be there.  It was quite an experience.  We got a lot more home decorating ideas - as if I don't have enough from TLC or HGTV.  Now all we need is money to implement those ideas, and time.  We also went downtown and did "Taste of Chicago."  It was a lot of food, a lot of people, and music.  It was like a hybrid Woodstock and Common Ground.  We walked around for a while but then left to walk the city and then went back to the hotel pretty early.  There was a pool and we swam with some other unpatriotic kids while the fireworks went off.
