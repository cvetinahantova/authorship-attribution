urlLink MUSEUM - Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum  This is a neat arcade (and museum) that has old arcade games and coin operated novelties from the 19th, 20th, and 21st Centuries.  Admission is free but of course everything costs a quarter to operate.  One oddity is a PT Barnum replica of the Cardiff Giant.  There is a whole page dedicated to its story.  Strangley, the 10 foot giant is not coin operated.  A 19th Century atheist-farmer decided to pull one over on fundamentalist Christians by creating this statue and claiming it was proof that the Biblical giants really walked the earth.  The fundamentalists fell for it and the farmer made 300k despite the objections of scientists of the time who easily recognized the fraud.  I would like to visit this museum in the future.  I would have a blast there.  And, the Cardiff giant story is a good one for teaching information literacy.  Just because you want to believe something, it does not mean it is true.
