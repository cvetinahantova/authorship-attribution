urlLink Teaching about Child Labor and International Human Rights. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is written by Gregory Hamot and Beth Jensen.  It looks at ways that students can be taught about child labor laws and human rights.  From the ERIC Digest:  Not all economic activity performed by children is necessarily a "worst form" of child labor. The International Labor Organization (ILO) distinguishes between acceptable forms of work by children and child labor that should be eradicated. The ILO defines child labor as "all children under 15 years of age who are economically active excluding (i) those who are under five years old and (ii) those between 12 14 years old who spend less than 14 hours a week on their jobs, unless their activities or occupations are hazardous by nature or circumstance" (ILO 2002, 32).   Of course, any form of labor that endangers a child, denies a child's right to an education, or exposes a child to illicit activities is unacceptable. The unacceptable, worst forms of child labor include work such as bonded labor, prostitution and pornography, illicit activities, armed combat, and physically and mentally hazardous labor. These worst forms manifest themselves in violations of a nation's minimum age laws; threats to a child's physical, mental, or emotional well being; intolerable abuses such as child slavery, forced labor, or hazardous working conditions; illicit activities such as drug and contraband trafficking or debt bondage; and work that prevents a child from going to school.
