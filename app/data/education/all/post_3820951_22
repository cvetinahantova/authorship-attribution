after class yesterday, i went to the library to do research for my report next next saturday. had to find books on the topic so i typed the word "children's play" on the computer... naturally, theater plays were also listed for me... on page 4, the very last entry was "Evita"...that made me smile..=) so i clicked on page 5 and the first entry was "Looking for Richard"... it's a sign right? to the person involved...i'm thinking it's a sign...what do you think? a sign for what?
