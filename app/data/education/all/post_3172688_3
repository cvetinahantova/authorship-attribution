Hey! I'm having a sort of, kind of, good day today. Its been alright, I guess... Anyways last night when I got out of school I found out that my ex-boyfriend wanted to beat up my new boyfriend, my mom kept ragging on me to find my glasses, and for some reason, my little cousin wants to be the biggest brat ever to me. But today I've been in this nice little calm mood and I have only yelled and one guy today (the guy that my ex sent after my boyfriend). Its almost lunch so I might get to yell at my ex. Anyways, I guess its all good.  I miss my camping buddy, though, so I'm kind of sad about that. Its almost been a year since I've seen him. But he lives in Michigan so its not like I can just walk across the street and see him. Anyways the bell is going to ring so I got to go. Bye!
