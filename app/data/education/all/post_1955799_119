Hello all,  I haven't been myself lately, and at last finals are done.  Last Friday, while driving home, someone started shooting.   A bullet hit my car.  Thankfully I was not shot, but My car was hit.  Called 911, filed a report, called the insurance company.  All this time finals are going on.   Well, I was shaken, but not destroyed.   I finished my last final yesterday.  When I checked my grades this evening, I got a big fat  98 .  Yes!!!!!!  I'll post more later, but for now I gotta go.   ---Stacy  P.S.
