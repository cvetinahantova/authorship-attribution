Happy Easter everyone!  I loved Mass today -- I saw all these people from High School that I know! Yay!! Rachel was singing, as was Lindsay, and that dude who sits in front of me in Spanish that always gets in the newspaper for baseball was there...it was awesome. There was a funny Homily because Father Nick asked all the children to go up and help him explain how easter eggs came about to help symbolize new life, etc. It was hilarious because the kids say the funniest things up there...  In any case, despite the happy, springy feel of today I couldn't help but keep worrying about Amanda. She won't tell me anything, and I know she's hurting herself or doing something, but she won't talke to me about any of it. I know some things are better left alone, and not everything is my business, but honestly if it's something as serious as this to the point where I never know if I'll see Amanda the next school day, then I think something must be done. I don't want to lose another friend, especially if that friend is Amanda. I would never forgive myself if Amanda died.  I just don't know what to do...   In this world of circumstance Children never fear forever And this moment that enchants Someday we will both remember  Then, maybe then If we are still alive Then, maybe then This moment will survive...  There is time in every word There are words in every reason And these notes that are unheard One day they may find their season  Then, maybe then If we are still alive Then, maybe then This monent will survive... Will survive...                urlLink adopt your own virtual pet!       Teehee...
