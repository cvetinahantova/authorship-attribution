I pass the three advance tests! YAY! And the math test with 4! YAY! DOUBLE YAY!!!!!  *sings* I'm a happy girl in a happy world !   Well, that means I ain't taking any math at all from now on. Don't get me wrong, I like math, otherwise I wouldn't have pass the test. But, I ain't needing math in what i'm going to study... I guess my friend is right... I should have picked something that has to do with it, because I'm actually good at it. But I don't see the fun in that, so I picked something more analytical and where I can help others.   SG:SG1 S:8!!!! It's starting on July 9. And I'm praying GOD that dad can get the satellite back up by then! I'm going to miss on so much! Now that is getting good! Its not fair since I've been watching that show for years! Since season 1! Not FAIR! Please God, let dad find $150 for it! Pretty please! I know!... I'll see if I have some luck with the lotto, at least "Pega 2"... 3 times.. That will be $150... *cross fingers*
