For the first time I was letting myself be lead.  I started looking through papers that seemed like the thing one is suppose to do when  looking for something.   My innocents and lack of listening to the universe was apparent and I wasn't tuned I was doing what I had done in the past I was looking for a sign or something to stand out.   I had been directed, by my internal voice and not knowing this I began my search and there it was I am not sure what it was telling me, I had this positive comfort that this was the  job I was looking for. There was this deep emotional spirituality drawing me to this craft of helping people.  What I was learning to do was help people at levels I wasn't aware of.  The lesson was to listen and be directed, this lesson was to evolve with a new horizon.   We as humble people forget that we are body and soul influenced by positive and negative directions of energy. So I questioned normality before. Is it within us??     So the next question was :what was body and soul how do we function humbly beside it?     I looked for an answer in my religion I found a place where communication to your soul is humbly accessible and the church become a place of communication with me. Or Should I say through me without looking at it to religisously.
