so despite the fact that i gave him a wakeup call and a 5 minute warning call, paul overslept, and didn't make it to church this AM... go figure... another time i guess.  lunchtime, then homework forever... apparently scott and eric want to work at a bookstore, so the two of them and colleen are waiting on me to finish eating and get myself over to campus to drive with them.... joy.  homework all afternoon... i can't wait. =P
