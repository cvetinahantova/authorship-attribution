I'm Eponine!       Spunky, resourceful, and fearless, I don't take a lot of guff from the world, and sometimes I'm kind of freaky. Secretly, though, I just want to be loved in spite of my attitude and my goofy hat.   urlLink  Which Les Miserables Character Are You?           Bleh. That pretty much sums up how I'm doing today.

Plus, it's cold and rainy, and I have to walk clear across to the other end of campus by 1:00 today.  Just bleh!
