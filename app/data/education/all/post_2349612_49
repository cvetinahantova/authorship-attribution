it's SNOW FLURRYING outside!!!! not a ton... just like the occasional bunch of styrafoam-like pieces floating through the air on occasion, but nonetheless... yay!  how am i today?  way excited about the snow, but 2 words: caffeine hangover... it's a shame that when caffeine has the drastic effect on someone like it does on me (see last night's post =P), it doesn't last... it just leaves you the next morning a complete grump with a major headache and lots of people remembering dumb things you said and did that you're a little vague on... oops  but hey, it's SNOWing! that counts for something =)
