Well, I am not going to comment on the night-long celebrations and festivities held in Athens, Greece upon the return of Greek national football team.  The major news networks have already done so in splendid fashion.  You can read what the  urlLink BBC ,  urlLink CNN/Sports Illustrated , and  urlLink Reuters  wrote.  However, I believe that this quote by legendary football (as in US-style football, not soccer) coach Vince Lombardi fits the bill perfectly:  ===== I firmly believe that any man's finest hour --- his greatest fulfillment to all he holds dear is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle --- victorious. =====  And this is exactly what our team did: they withstood all pressure, they beat seemingly unbeatable opponents and in the end, they stood there exhausted and victorious for the whole world to admire.  We are the champions. Period. Δεν μπορώ να περιμένω, σήκωσε ... το ευλογημένο  Ioannis, 20040706115000
