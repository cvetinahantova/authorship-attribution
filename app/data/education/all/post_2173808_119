Listening to the Democratic convention and Kerry's speech in particular made me realize how much Ronald Reagan and his ideas continue to shape the American political landscape.  Sure, the differences are there, but the key themes in Kerry's speech were patriotism, military strength, families, values, faith, and tax cuts.  Sounds like Reagan to me.
