All I want is to drill straight and true holes in wood. Is that so much to ask?  Yes. Yes, it is.  It's really hard to drill straight. Several of my drills are equipped with onboard levels.  I have also employed doweling jigs.  I have even clamped straight-edges parallel to the work for a visual reference.  The results have been mixed.  It is this very problem that drives most sane people to go out and buy a drill press. Plop the work on the table, pull the lever, and presto, a straight hole.        The General Tools drill guide.  Skip it. Sears makes a better one for less. You can get a benchtop drill press for about $100, but the problem is the same as with just about any cheap tool: It will suck. To be more specific, cheap drill presses have cheesy tables, not much capacity, not much power, and too much runout, which is to say "slop." You're out $100, and you have a tool that basically sucks. And all you wanted was to drill straight holes in wood.  So you start looking at real drill presses and gradually go insane.  Look. You have a drill. It makes holes. All you want is for the holes to be straight. There has to be a way.         The Craftsman drill guide.  $27.  Buy it. And there is. Well, supposedly. It's called a drill guide. The Big Box stores sell one by General Tools for around $38, and I stared at it quite awhile before deciding that I would be better off with a $100 drill press that sucks.  Then I ran across a much superior drill guide for $10 less at Sears. Yes, the much-maligned, evil, hated Sears. The Craftsman drill guide has steel guide posts, spring action, a Jacobs chuck, and a much nicer, more clampable footplate with a side-mounted grip.  I took it home.  First of all, this is not a drill press.  There's too much play in the mechanism, which translates to runout. But unless you're machining metal parts, you have my permission to laugh at runout. What I want to do with this thing is drill straight pilot holes in wood.  Pilot holes are slightly undersized, and wood is malleable, more like clay than metal. Put away your feeler gauges and forget about runout.  Also, there's a lot you can do with a drill guide that you can't do with a drill press. You can carry it to the work.  You can dry-fit and clamp up a whole cabinet and shoot holes right into the assembly.  You can drill straight or angled holes in studs.  You can carry it outside and drill holes in your house.  For what I want to do, the drill guide is actually better than a drill press.  The first thing I did with mine was shoot holes for the hanger bolts that would attach a wooden face to my miter gage.  Because I was attaching metal parts to the wooden face using nuts and washers, the pilot holes needed to be dead straight. And they were. Maybe with the right measuring tools and a bit of squinting, you could detect some error. But one thing's for sure: With the drill guide, I can shoot straighter than before.  Much straighter.  Was it worth $27? Oh, yes.  You can also mount this thing under a table with a hole in it and use it as a little drum sander. Haven't tried that yet.
