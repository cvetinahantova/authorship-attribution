Gah, I didn't go to bed until 2 last night ... well, this morning, and dad woke me up at 9:30 because he wants me to cut grass.  Not fair, he told me I wouldn't have to cut grass anymore, I could clean the house instead.  But nonetheless, I'm cutting anyway, so this issue won't be too long... Dad's coming in and telling us to go ahead and eat because when he calls us we have to go.    Maybe I'll edit this and write more later!  [edit](1:20 pm) Well, I went out and cut my grass, it took a little over an hour.  I like to cut my grass all at once.  My mom brings out water every 15 minutes because it's so hot and humid today.  I fell when I was cutting my side yard.  There are these little sink hole type things in my yard, and I wasn't looking and stepped in one of the smalled ones, and nearly twisted my ankle and skinned up my knee.  Dad was cutting grass in the backyard when it happened, and it wasn't really looking, but I do think he noticed.  I got up as fast as I could manage, and kept on cutting my grass.  When I got done cutting, Dad complimented my "cutting style".  He said he wished his boys cut as good as his girl.  I was pissed because I was tired, not really mad at anything that had happened.  I'm tired, but not so tired I feel the need to take a nap.  Well, we're going to go to Wal*Mart... again... LOL  M u c h  L o v e ! ![/edit]
