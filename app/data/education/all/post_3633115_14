I love to sing.  I feel like I am on a stage and just belting out tunes that amaze the world over.  The trouble with my singing is that I really can't carry a tune that well.  I have a tendency to sing off key.  This really sucks since I enjoy singing and used to have delusions of grandeur that I would be overheard and signed to a huge contract.  Oddly, the only time I really can seem to sing well is in the car or at church... neither of which I do much of.  I don't sing much in the car because currently I'm cursed with a 1966 Ford Galaxie that only has AM (It's talk radio, oldies, or tejano all day! woo) and I don't sing at church because I don't go much anymore.  However, when a good song comes on my AM radio stations or I'm actually at church...watch out because I will belt out tunes at the near top of my voice.  hmm hmm hmm hmm
