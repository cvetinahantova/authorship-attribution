I'd just like to take a moment to shed a little light on my opinion of two staff members that I feel don't do a very good job. Michelle Yankee, public enemy #1 on my list. This woman I feel just doesn't want to do her job. A little while after the whole Homecoming Changes thing came out, our class, which was to only class to go and fight her on the issues I might add, scheduled a meeting with her. Most of the changes I feel had reasonable explanations, except one, the whole thing about not being allowed to make your own shirt. I understand you may have a problem with a few students, but that's no reason to oppress our first amendment right. The fact that her only response to the issue was "...that would be too hard for me to monitor." is ridiculous. It's your job to monitor! Do it! Same response was applied to the web blog issue, she told my father that it was well written, but that he would have to understand that something like that would be, "...too hard for me to monitor." What is there to monitor, It's an outside site, you have nothing to do with what I can or cannot write. She isn't alone on my list though. Meet public enemy #2, Rob McIntyre. He's a great guy and all, and I'm sure he's a hell of a science teacher, but the man just isn't cut out for being a class advisor. He is always late to meetings, or doesn't even show up sometimes. There is no way to get in touch with the man besides e-mail, he doesn't have his own room, he's movin around all day. During the whole web blog thing, he had the nerve to make several rude comments, and I feel he was just the administration's lackey through the whole thing. But that's just my opinion of the two, feel free to post your own.
