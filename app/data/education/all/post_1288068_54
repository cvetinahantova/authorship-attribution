I am in bed. Can't really write too much at once ...  People went to the pub. The people were me and Lucy and Jon and Sally and Rob and Hav and Chris. I drank too much gin. It tastes like celery. Sally made puppets happen and said I was a beauty. Hahaha! My legs hurt, I don't know why. My head is really hot too.  I have to go to college soon to pay off my library fine and get my portfolio. Lucy will give me a lift home which is good but oh god our flat is shameful I hope she doesn't want tea because there is no milk. Or cups. Or tea.  I am sad to leave everyone. Being teacher is a bit alarming.  In other news, I would like to announce that for the next two months I am free as a bird. Place your bookings now for shopping, cinemaing, coffeeing, members' lounging and general larking. Woo!  Have a lovely Friday everyone. x
