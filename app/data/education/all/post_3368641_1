please don't hate me because i am so beautiful i broke bottles unconsciously and crawled across the cut glass  as a raging spectacle with everyone knowing how stupid in appearance the smartest little underachiever was in his closet of costumes  go ahead and laugh at me i know the tumultuous humor well as i burned bridges  and lit fires under the asses of unsuspecting dreamers then sat back and watched them scurry around like ants under looking glasses  i like being quantum blueberries dancing and spinning  the last drop out of each moment i dare you to try to keep up with me you have a lot to learn if you think i ever stood still long enough for you to label me or value me or judge me or be like me  speaking in tongues or treading water i cannot make out a single word or action that you display your chance to hold  my waning attention span is rapidly reaching quantum speeds just when you thought you've read me i'm gone  Â©2003 DC Vision
