I will be moving out of my apartment in a little over two weeks and less than a full week later my successor will be moving in.  I must say that one of the things that made moving in so easy was moving into an already furnished apartment.  While I spent a decent some of money buying everything from my predecessor, I quickly realized that it was money well spent.  My successor might in fact have a pretty rough start.  While I offered to sell him everything for a very reasonable price, he wanted to do things on his terms.  Unfortunately, he isn't exactly in a position to make demands and while I was willing to negotiate prices and payment options, I was not willing to give most of my things away for nothing.  So what does that mean?!?!?  I have now advertised everything to current jets who are staying another year.  Over the next two weeks I will be having an everything must go sale and when my successor arrives in 3 weeks, it appears he will be arriving to an empty apartment.  In less than 24 hours requests for information and availability for all major furniture and appliances have been made.  While I was really trying to help the new guy out and make things easy for both of us, I am now just trying to clear everything out.  I really wonder what it will be like to arrive in a foreign country and finally make it to your apartment only to realize that there is no fridge, no washing machine, no microwave, no furniture...I can't imagine it would make for a very warm welcoming.
