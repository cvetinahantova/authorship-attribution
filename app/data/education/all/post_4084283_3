A painful lesson.... That's wat I learnt on the 16 August 2004. I've just lost my wallet in bus 189. I guess I was careless. I left the bus without tapping my EZ link card thinking tat it was in my bag. Bugger... The next second I knew... the wallet is gone. Me n my fren Sue tried to get up the bus to check, but the unfriendly bus driver claimed some weirdo picked it up n made away wif my beloved wallet!!! Arghhhhh!!!.... The trouble does not stop there.... my 70+ bucks were in there... along wif my jus-topped-up ez link, my ic.... me n fiance's photos..... lotsa other cards!!!..... I'm just so dead and gone.......      Luckily my sweet fiance and faithful fren Sue were around to pacify me s my tears broke like a river dam..... I just couldn't take tis.... I kept thinking wat I cud have done better to prevent this....... I've sworn to myself not to be the absent-minded fool I've became over these years.... It's just not worth it.... THe lesson is just to painful for me to bear.....      Consequences of my action,   * $100 replacement fee for making of lost ic   * new EZ link..... another $30 buckaroos!!   * cashcard - $10   * replacement of POSB ATM card - lost of precious marking and course time   * purchase of a new wallet - $100++ (tat was an Anna Sui latest range I lost, birthday gift from Mr    Zirk)   * our "tabung kita kita" - 70+ buckaroos!!   * a foreseen month of dwelling and sense of lost and guilt and anger!!         Those... ladies and gentlemen are wat I perceive and expect to go through within the immediate future..... Mr Zirk told me to take one thing at a time....To learn the lesson of being mindful of my belongings.... to not be in a rush or hurry and always check.....      BUT I'm always in a rush...always ON-THE-GO!!!!!      hOW?????
