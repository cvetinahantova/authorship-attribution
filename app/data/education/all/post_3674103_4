as i write this, i'm sitting next to a student who is doing her listening tests on the computer. it wouldn't be that horrible listening to easy english stories as they fill in their answers (i've already heard so many by now that i have quite a few memorized), but the sad fact that the kids are allowed to listen to the stories as many times as they need drives me crazy. i mean, there are only so many times i can hear the sentence, 'the car is moving' before i turn around and scream at the kid for playing it another time.  on another note, i happen to read an article about this organization called moving america forward (or america moving forward or something along those lines). this 'grassroots' organization (and i use the term grassroots loosely since i have reasons to believe it's just a front) is actually trying to censor michael moore's new movie. it seriously upset me enough to join their message group just so i could post and ask them what the hell they think they are doing. i'll spare you the entire rant, but it had something to do with america being a democracy and the people having a right to question authority and government, otherwise it would be, what, fascism? i also considered the opposite view. does anyone think that if a movie came out that had a more neoconservative view, all the liberals in america would want to start organizations to censor it? i think we all know the obvious answer here.
