A new Strategic Plan Committee is being put together by our superintendent. The job of the committee will be to "update our mission statement, beliefs, objectives, parameters, and strategies to guide the school system's efforts, resources, and spirit toward improved quality of teaching and learning, as well as service to our community. To ensure that the new plan reflects the views and needs of all the constituencies that the school system services." The school system will be updating its plan to "refocus the school system's vision in order to meet the needs of future students and to ensure that its commitment to continuous improvement is met."
