The  urlLink big city folks  make IC seem a lot more interesting than it really is.  (Rock on with the mention of the Lincoln, though).   Now that we've (sort of) moved on: do you guys really like this place?  The workshop experience and the people aside,  I kinda fucking hate it.  The problem is not the midwest-- I lived in Madison for four years and loved it-- it isn't even  urlLink Herky , though I wouldn't really mind if that mangy vulture were  urlLink murdered in a ritual fashion .    The real problem is  urlLink Coralville .  The problem is TWO enormous but horrible china buffets across the street from one another, the mini-mall of America, the fact that a town was basically invented to house fast food restaurants, shitty hotels for visiting college athletes, landlord offices and strip clubs that are difficult to locate.  (Not to mention the most evil dog-trainer I have ever met.)  Sometimes I wonder if Coralville was modelled after a level of Purgatory, the particular place you go for driving like a jerk, or for masturbating too much.     Maybe I'm overreacting, but when I think about Coralville too much, I get depressed.  And this isn't a leftist, elitist, whateverist rant.  it just depresses me.  Everything that is wrong with Coralville is everything that is wrong with this country, this world, and me.  If I ever write a manifesto, Coralville will be of central and metaphorical significance.
