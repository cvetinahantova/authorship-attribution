I repainted my room. It used to be blue. Now it's 2 different shades of green! Thanks to my dad for buying the paint and supplies. And thanks to my friends Tom and Timmy for helping paint. (You know who you are! I love your guys' nicknames. Mines just plain Bob.....) I'm sorry you couldn't make it Joey. I know you wanted to.  Â   Peaces,  Lysie
