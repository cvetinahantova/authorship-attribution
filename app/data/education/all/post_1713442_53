urlLink Working with Adult Learners in the Library Classroom: A Personal Reflection.  I know I have focused on school librarianship and teaching children lately in this blog.  Today, I will turn this around 180 degrees and talk about teaching adults.  This link is to a paper I wrote and placed at LibraryInstruction.Com.  It is based on my experiences teaching a non-credit library course for the community at Michigan State University.  I write, "I have had the opportunity over the last six years to teach non-traditional students about doing research in libraries.  This experience has allowed my to think a great deal about adult learners in contrast to the traditionally aged college students I normally teach.  In this paper, I will address my personal observations of adult learning as I understand it from my experience and from the education and library literature.  I will also examine my personal pedagogy which I believe is appropriate to these learners.  Further, I will look at how pedagogy can depend on the nature of the learner, the nature of the content, and the technology that delivers it."
