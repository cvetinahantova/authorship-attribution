Often times if you are helping someone use a computer, they are already in an uncomfortable position.  If you spout off computer lingo, you can only confuse them further and cause them more stress!  If you help them through it slowly and basically, you are much more likely to succeed in the task and with that person.  It is beneficial to be honest...like the article stated, if you don't know, say you don't know.  If you are guessing, say something like, let's try this.  I have often guessed on how to do things and said, no, that's not the way to do it, let me try something else.  I will just keep poking around until it works or I get frustrated enough to start over.  So remember when you are working with someone who needs help.....  be positive, respectful and walk them slowly through the process.  Don't rush them because they are probably already a little apprehensive.  BC
