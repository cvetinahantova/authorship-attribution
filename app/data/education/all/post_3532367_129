Think of a number between 2 and 4, then steer well clear of them. Their customer service is shit. I've spent 2 weeks on the phone to India, spending anything up to 90 minutes at a time on hold. They wont put me through to the relevant department (collections) without me explaining everything to 3 other people. I've been cut off 4 times while on hold - make that 5....   THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING - ARRGH!  Call 6 today - "Will I be getting a new number?" "Yes!" "Last time I rang they said I could keep my old number. " "No actually you will get a new number." "I'm not happy having a new number." "My mistake you can keep your old number." "Sorry, but I dont believe you, can you put me through to collections in the UK please?" "No you can't speak to collections." "I am the customer, I want to pay a bill, put me through to collections please." Silence......"OK I will put you through, please hold.........."
