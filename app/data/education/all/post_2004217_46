Mother Dearest and I went to B'ham today to the Turner Exhibition at the Art Gallery, and then went shopping and I bought my very first pair of CHUCK TAYLORS!! Eeeee they're soooo pretty, classic style but white with paint splodges all over them... soooo nice I want to wear them forever and ever. Which reminds me, I'm going to have to put my jeans in the wash soon... *sniffle*  Got a letter from the CSA today saying that Dad should be paying us exactly what he has been paying us for the last year. Well £9 more, but who counts pennies? Dad counts pennies, that's who! I got an e-mail from him when I got home saying that he's going to cut my pocket money by £9  and  make me pay my own phone bill because of this. My phone bill comes to roughly £10 per month, so when you work it out, for the extra £9 he's got to give the CSA, he's taking £19 away from me. Mum says I should just tell him to stick it all up his arse and say goodbye; refuse to see him again. Admittedly, it's tempting, but for some reason I can't. I don't think I'd want to be one of those kids with only one parent, it seems very scary. She apologised for giving me such a shit father as well. It amazes me how my parents are so different, when you think about it. She would never, ever dream of treating me like he has... when you cut to the chase, you can see that he hasn't thought through what he's doing, he's just penny-pinching and that no matter how many times and to how many people he says that I'm the most important thing in his world, I'll always know I'm second best to his own personal interests: What's best for him? How can he get as much money as possibly from his bitter ex wife and child? Fuck you. Fuck you. Even shoes can't help me now...  Ceff x   I often wonder how you feel when you're lying (next) to me...
