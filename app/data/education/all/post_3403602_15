Hello Little World! God...I nvr felt like this before. I thought being single would be the greatest thing ever. I can do whatevr I want. Kiss who evr I want and blah blah blah...But now I just feel like I wanna stay with one person only...But I cant cuz I know Ill be rejected...God I cant believe I said that. But yeah. I like to many people when I know I may nvr get with them or even talk to them. It hurts...Badly...And I feel like shit. And when I find out someone likes me I get all excited. They think im a kool guy but when they met me they change their mind. Its been like that with evryone. So I might as well die...or sleep...either one, I dont care. Lucy...If you are reading this...I think that is why I felt like shit in 5ht....And I might continue feeling like this...But it wont stop me from going to yer house and wetting you and Louie babe. Lol...Well...Im done crying, trying and lying. Bye!! XoxO
