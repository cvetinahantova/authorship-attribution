Mood:  Happy :)  Listening To:  Nothing, too late  Wow, wasted Monday and Tuesday. Dossed, played games, surfed, chatted. Had a good bitching session with craig tho. Really dislike Mark; have no real problem with Ben, but how he begs it from ben and paddy is sorta sad.  Aidans grandad had a heart attack, hence the shortage of him. Jo was at Marks for 2 nights, hence her shortage. I'll be out to the cinema tomorrow, maybe with a review for the blog, who knows.  Reason for happiness?...Ryan. Pretty damn cute guy. Sweet, never been in a relationship before. Seems well decent, heh fallen in love (L) but yeah he's well cool and we'll prolly be meeting, w00t!  Short sweet post. I think I post more when depressed :/  PS:- Reading Dead Air by Iain Banks, pretty good so far, excellent Author.  End Transmission
