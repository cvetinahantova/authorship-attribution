So today S and I are travelling around town.  We are trying to locate some kinds of underbed drawer systems so we can get rid of our beat to hell dressers and get more space in our room.  While we are driving around we decide that we are tired of our two credit cards that have insanely high interest rates, despite our pleas for them to be lowered.  So we made a somewhat snap decision.  We went to our credit union and asked for a personal load so we could pay off our cards and lose them forever.  Considering that we only needed $8,800 to pay off our cards we were instantly approved.  We got this loan at only 9.99% and will definitively have it paid off in no longer than 60 months. Hooray!  I feel as though a load has been lifted from my shoulders.  The hardest part was, our credit union just cut us a check so that we could put the money where we wanted.  We only use the credit union for our savings and loans, so we wanted to put the check into our checking account at a local bank.  I have $8,800 burning a freaking hold in my pocket.  Damn the bank for not crediting it right now so I can make the necessary electronic payments and be done with the whole thing!
