Finally!!     My own blog!!   Actually I had the intention of creating a blog since few years back. However, I just did not manage to make myself sit in front of the com and write.   But now I fell that it's a good idea to create one cause I want to be in touch with all my friends whom I miss and it's a way I can update them on what's happening to me.    I just finished my ethics class and I'm VERY glad that it ended an hour earlier. Not that I don't like the teacher or anything, but time just seem to FREEZE everytime there's an ethics class.   This is also my first time using the computer in the computer lab. Well, it's actually not as bad as what I heard, although there's a strange smell emitting from the air-con.      Was going aroud asking some of my friends whether they want to go to Malacca this weekend, but most of them doesn't seem interested with the idea except for Jie Ying.    It seems that I may have to go alone this weekend(if I can find a place to stay and there's not much homework) or go another time when it's more appropriate.
