The heat out here in the Antelope Valley is unreal.  It feels like a dream.  I can't believe that it is actual life.  It's like a Budapest sauna room.  EURO DELUXE  From Paris we went to Madrid.  It was quite a little train ride, it was.  An overnight ordeal.  Espana.  bonita.  In Spain, my lingustic skills were in full effect.  In France, I was lost.  I understood not a word., but in Spain, in Spain I was a king.
