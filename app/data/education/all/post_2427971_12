Ok... What has happened since my last post, humm... Well,   talked to Katherine for a few hours and played Gunbound last night... Went to bed aound 12, got up around 9. Got a little further on my Halo game, then got stuck again. Sorta just waited for Kat to get up... She woke up around 1, thought we'd attmp to go to Gothika with Sarah... Didn't work out so well, so we went to Barnes & Nobel and hung out there for a while. After that we walked over to Blockbuster and rented Darkness Falls(demented tooth fairy, very different) and Silent Hill 3(strange Resident Evil look-a-like, has zombies with twitchy heads). Did all that and had some really good spare ribs Sarah's dad made. Then Conley came over and they planned out their costumes for the LOTR on Wednesday, their gonna look awesome and I'm gonna be with them. Ran around town, first to Kat's(had some conflict with her parents, I knew there was gonna be some argument of some sort), then to Sarah's mom's house(found some... dress bluerint or something), then the last place was the Wal-Mart fabrics section(by now it was about 8:30 and that's where I'd be 'til about 11). So they looked at all the fabrics, I helped by being patient and holding anything they needed to be held. They found out it was gonna cost a lot more than they had expected. Katherine had to leave early so Sarah went to the bank but the ATM wasn't working so Kat gave her 90 bucks to buy the fabrics... Then she dropped her off, the roads were slick as-fucking-snot. God, by the time we got out of Wal-Mart I knew it was gonna suck. We slipped a little bit, but then Sarah was going to fast and had to turn of the highway... Haha, she turned the wheel as far as it would go but the car just kept sliding and eventually hit the curb of the turnoff. No one was near us when it happened so it was alright, she just backed up and drove on. Yeah, so it was really fucking fun and was a good use of a Saturday!
