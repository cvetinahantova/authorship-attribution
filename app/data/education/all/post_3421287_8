Kids got away ok, so now I'm here alone.    Very quiet.    I used to get this peace every weekend, but this is the first time I have been alone in the last 5 months, since the kids stopped seeing their dad.  It's very quiet.  I have a friend who might come over for the day on Thursday.  I'm pretty sure he's only coming for sex.  Which suits me - might be another five months before I get the house to myself again.
