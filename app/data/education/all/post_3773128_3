Went to support our INTEC badminton team in the inter-faculty competition last night. I never knew there's so much fun being on the spot to cheer for a team during a competition. At least now I have a slight idea why so many people are crazy about going to the stadium and watch football matches. Although our team didn't win, they put up a good fight. And the most amazing thing was that some of them didn't know each other very well though they were playing doubles in a team.  As many of my coursemate went to do their passport this morning, there wasn't any classroom lesson. However, Q1 SonSengNim gave another of his speech to us, talking about his experiences when he first came to Malaysia in 1991; telling us that foreign tourist have to pay more when they go to KL Tower, and when he sent a letter to the Tourism board concerning the matter the reply he got was "Because this is Malaysia"; motivating and persuading us to go to the top universities in Korea and informing us that getting a 'D' in those universities is considered quite good......  I'll be going back home tomorrow. Quite excited actually. After all, this return is quite unexpected because my initial plan was to go back once only before I fly off to Korea. Now it seems that I'll be going back home twice.
