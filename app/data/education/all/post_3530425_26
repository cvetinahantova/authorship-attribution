Today in Women's Studies, a girl and I had a brief exchange about the difference between writen erotica and porn.  She asked me what I think the difference is, but I'm not satisfied with my response.  I said I think erotica is about beautiful, consensual sex, and porn is offensive.  I gave as an example of porn a really disturbing scene from a novel by Mary Gaitskill (whose title I've forgotten) in which one young girl rapes another with a toothbrush.  The question came up because of Gaitskill's short story "Secretary," which was assigned reading for today's class, in which a girl was spanked by her lawyer boss and subsequently abused in other ways.  The question I left unanswered is, offensive to whom?  The scene in question was anything but consensual, so for me, offensive includes rape, whether by a stranger or an acquaintance or a partner.  That the girl was emotionally damaged by the spanking is what made the story pornographic, rather than erotic to me, even though she went to the bathroom at work and masturbated after the encounter.  Simply being turned on by an act is not sufficient to constitute consent.  Our bodies often betray us in their responses, especially to sexual touch.  Have you ever not wanted to make love, but went along with it anyway, only to find yourself physically responding, even though your heart isn't really in it?  I know I have.  I'm pretty sure a Republican said it, in response to a request for a definition of porn:  "I know it when I see it."  I'm still not satisfied with this response though.
