It's interesting that I woke up today with a joy and a bounce in my legs. Somehow, having the talk with Lipyong yesterday really encouraged me. Plus, after I've seen the little boy who is fighting for his life in the hospital with the mother staying strong in faith and support, it's really hard to keep grudges in my heart. Somehow everything that has offended me just seems so small and minor. it really brought perspective back into me. Praise God for bringing such godly people and situationsto help bring me back to senses. Somehow, I really feel the joy bubbling in me again. It is something I always feel God has blessed me with, the fruit of joy.      School toady no longer seems to be so tiresome. Just had my observation by the senior teachers. Not sure of how I did, but I trust in the Lord and to know that what is important is that the kids actually do understand the topic. Praise God once again for everything.
