(As told by Ronald P. Reagan (his son) in his eulogy)  One day, dad decided to revive the thumbs up gesture. So, he went all over the country of course giving everybody the thumbs up. I found myself in the presidential limousine one day returning from a big event. Dad was of course thumbs upping the crowd. All of a sudden, looming in the window was this snarling face.  Reviving an entirely different hand gesture, he hoisted an entirely different digit in our direction.  Dad saw this and said, "You see, I think it's catching on."
