I stayed up until quarter after 4 this morning playing The Sims on PS2.  Wow, I was definately zombified.  The first time I checked the clock it was already 3 and I was thinking, well, I'll just play for a little while longer and then go to bed.  So an hour later, not tired or anything I headed to bed... and tossed and turned for a good hour.  Can we say manic??  Geez.  Well, me and mama are going to go shopping in a little bit.  I'm going to cash the 500$ check from Granny (from Graduation) and the 76$ check I earned at work 2 weeks ago.  I gotta buy clothes for camp because I really don't have anything suitable.  I gotta get 10 sets of clothes and some pjs... and in those 10 sets of clothes, I'm including 10 pairs of underwear, 10 bras, 10 pairs of socks, and tennis shoes.  Well, I'm gunna bounce on out and go shopping with mama!  Much Love ..::and more later::..
