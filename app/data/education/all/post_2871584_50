Today was my last day of work for the summer.  If only the weather could figure out how that is supposed to work.  Yesterday was unbearably hot and humid all day.  Today, I woke up to a forty degree morning.  There is no making sense of weather around here at all.  This evening, I spent an unnatural amount of time on the phone, a good portion of that spent discussing the new Harry Potter movie.  My mother and I talked about it for a while, and then Doreen called, because she finally went and saw it yesterday.  All three of us agreed that if people really want to experience Harry Potter, they need to read the books.  The third movie turned a book about personal growth and development into an action flick with basically no character enhancement whatsoever.  And Doreen proclaimed herself as a "member of geek-dom" because the first thing that she noticed in the movie was that the school uniforms had changed (for the few minutes that they actually wore them in the movie).  All said, none of us is looking forward to seeing how they butcher the fourth book.  Now that the summer is upon me, I have to get going on... finding a summer job.  Go figure.  After all this time, I'm still looking for a summer job.  Oh well.  I suppose there are worse things.  Thankfully, I'm not in *too* much of a rush to find one.  I have the next week off, and then I'm running the children's crafts at the Arts Festival for a week.  If I don't have a job lined up at that point, then I'll have to break down and think about the really fun jobs, like running register or something.  With any luck, it won't come to that.
