where do i want to be in 5 years? 10 years? 20? it could happen. that's all i'm saying. i'm not saying anymore. it's too good. it's too good to be true. it's unreal. i've got to ground myself in reality, because i feel like it's all fake. i'm not complaining mind you. it's amazing. all of it. i just don't want to get my hopes up. who knows. things are looking good. no. strike that. things are looking great. and that's all i've got to say about that.   for now.
