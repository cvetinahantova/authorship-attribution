Bush's support for an amendment to ban gay marriages is truly appalling.  I've generally been a strong supporter of Bush's foreign policy, but you can't fight oppression abroad when you endorse it at home.  It's as if FDR in 1944 had come out for amending the Constitution to prohibit racial integration at the same time that we were fighting the Nazis.
