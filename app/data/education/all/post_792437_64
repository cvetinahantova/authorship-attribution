Slug    Â  Slug--a word my high school history teacher loved to use. I suppose I'm starting to understand the meaning of it now. He would say it to students who were lazy and didn't do much. Mmmm..I feel that way for the past few days..maybe I'm getting my schedule back to normal from my one month hiatus in a different country. Or maybe I just don't want to be in school anymorel. Acck though! I have to be writing my thesis and I can't imagine doing it anymore....On top of it I have to still study for a biochem II class :(
