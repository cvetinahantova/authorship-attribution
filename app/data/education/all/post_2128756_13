So there's this little sliver of light. Teeny. And it's at the end of this really, really long and dark tunnel that winds its way up a mountain. And I'm wearing rollerskates. But this little sliver is the brightest thing in my universe, and I have a feeling that I'm supposed to get to it. And I'm wearing rollerskates.   Obviously, I'm being metaphorical here. But if I come right out and say what I think, let alone what I feel or want, that sliver of light might just die. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some skating to do.
