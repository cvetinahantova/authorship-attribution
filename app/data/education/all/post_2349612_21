so here i am back in memphis for the first time in 4 months...   really, i wasn't supposed to get in til tomorrow, but whatever... yesterday i drove the 6 hours from my place in jersey to aunt pris's house in pittsburgh no problem... after an evening of TV/movies w/ my cousins while aunt pris/uncle bob had to go to a funeral visitation, i got a bit of sleep and then was on the road again.... 12.5 hours from pittsburgh to memphis, most of it in crazy rain.  swtiched time zones along the way, so now even with me staying up insanely late like i usually do, i'm slightly more in pace with my family.  oh, here's the other exciting part -- mom dad and ryan's christmas present to themselves was to get a family computer -- it's kinda cool... flatscreen monitor... the tower has one side that's transparent and the insides light up in neon colors, so it's kinda fun looking too... and it's much faster than either of my old ancient machines... goal over break?  convince the parents that dsl/highspeed something or another is a worthwhile investment... for the time mom wanted to use the AOL dialiup trial CD she got at the post office this week, and hey unlimited dial up is better than nothing, right? =P  at any rate, insanely tired... (as i should be!  i've driving 1100+ miles in the last two days!)  time for some sleep.
