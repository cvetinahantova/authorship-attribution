Tommy may kill me for this, BUT...  Last night I did something I have never done before.    I gave him a shave, facial, no where else.    It was really nice.  He enjoyed it too.  I had always wanted to try giving him a shave.  But was too nervous.  I mean I didn't want to cut him and make him have to walk around with tissue stuck to his face.  So, I had never done it.  Or even mentioned it.  SO last night, he off-handedly says "why dont' you give me a shave, it's been a week, I need one bad."  So, I did it.  I have to say, there is something so intimate and personal to shaving a man.  It gives you a total sense of trust.  That is their face you are dealing with, you screw up and the whole world knows about it.  It is also very sensuous to it.    The boys thought it was plain ol' nauseating.  They kept coming in and running out, "that is just sick mom, just sick. "  We finally locked the door, they were ruining the mood.    We had a good night.  It brought us closer.
