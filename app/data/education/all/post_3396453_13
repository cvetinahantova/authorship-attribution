Wait for the boy who will make an ordinary moment seem magical, the kinda boy who brings out the best in you and makes you wanna be a better person. wait for the boy who will be your best friend, who will drop everything to be with you at any time no matter what the circumstances. wait for the boy who makes you smile like no one else, and when he smiles, you know he needs you. wait for the boy who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats and have no make-up on, but appreciates it when you get dolled up for him...and most of all, wait for the boy who will put you at the center of his universe, because that's where you belong.
