I really am horrible at this whole packing thing.  As if packing weren't normally bad enough, Ted and I have to pack up stuff that we plan to possibly not see again for two years but also pack up stuff that we will need/want to use in the next several months.  So basically we have to do a lot of sorting.  Some stuff obviously goes in the won't be needed for two years pile such as our blender or our dishes.  My dad will certainly have these things available for our usage.  However, books and CDs are trickier.  Some books are packed away, but we still have boxes of books yet to be read.  The sorting of our hundreds of CDs is particularly painful.  CDs we haven't looked at in months suddenly look so enticing.  And who knows, maybe in October will come the day when I desperately need to listen to the Bangles again!  I'm always thinking I'm going to need things that I won't need!  Speaking of packing, I really should get back to it.....
