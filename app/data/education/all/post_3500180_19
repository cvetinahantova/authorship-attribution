The reason why I didn't update yesterday was because of the end-of-the-year concert. It ran from 7p.m. to 10:15p.m., so by the time I got home, it was already 10:30. The concert was great. Jazz Band went first, then Concert Band (which I am in), and then Wind Ensemble. After the bands' performances, there was the awards presentation, and a New York Band Trip slide show. The slide show looked so fun, it almost made me feel sad that I didn't go on the trip.  ALMOST . Pshh, won't trade SOMA experience for anything in the world, for it  is  the greatest!  Anyways, back to the concert. Jazz band was good, can't remember too much about it, heh. Concert Band performed well last night. I was so afraid that we are going to screw up like we did on Monday's rehearsal, but we didn't. Instead, we were great :D! The only thing I didn't like about Wind Ensemble was because the songs were too long. They were great music, but just too long...-_-  The awards presentation was short, go Noogie for winning the Most Improved Student, pshh *pokes him* ^__^! Anyways, as I said before, the NYC slide show looked tempting, but SOMA RULES! Hahahaa...  Must go to study for the science test, I would be so screwed if I don't study for this one.. *crys*  -Nariel  Oh yeah, on a sidenote, SOMA = Southern Ontario Model United Nations Assembly. It PWNS all.
