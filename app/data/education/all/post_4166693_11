Today, I realized the meaning of the term melt-down. My account at work has officially done the melt-down thing. Yesterday, at 2:28 p.m., my account at the university where I work suddenly disappeared. The reason? I am a student at another university in our system, and, with the new software they are using, you are only allowed to have   one   email address in the system. When my internet-based course went through yesterday, the system went "huh?" and switched all my account info over to my grad school info. Poof! No more work account. This means: no more work-related email, no way to get in touch with me unless you call me, and no connection to my calendar! I can't check what I'm supposed to be doing! Ugh.  Thankfully, the IT people are working like mad to get things taken care of. This morning they switched everything back over to my work account, but then the system decided to change my user name. Um, no. And my real name is wrong suddenly. Suddenly, my name is Jennifer. Quoi?  I think computers may already be able to think, and we just don't realize it. I think it is switching my name on purpose. I think it hates me.
