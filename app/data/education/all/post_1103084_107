....  boring blogs  ....  i'm pretty sure that yesterday's public navel gazing blog qualifies as one such blog.   ready for me to go meta on that baby?  i perceive that on days when i feel overwhelmed by life and busyness etc.. (wednesdays it always reaches its peak/pique) NOT ONLY do I:   1. only feel and stop thinking,   but I also,   2. obsess over my own experience / feelings-about-the-experience,   and I also,   3. feel more need than ever for HUMAN CONTACT --   and the blog is an obvious opportunity to get some parasocial gratification.  And thus I conclude an even more solipsistic entry than the one before.    But I think its a little less boring?  Or is that just because public disclosure of feelings is boring?   And that, or course, public consideration of the implications and ramifications public disclosure of feelings is not at all boring....?  in any case, thursday has brought me much more --  peace~
