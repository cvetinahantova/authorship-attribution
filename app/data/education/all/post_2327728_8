Well, hello world.  I was reading a study recently about neurogenesis.  Turns out the experts were wrong - people continue to 'grow' neurons (brain cells) even after they are born, and throughout their life.  In particular, neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been linked to the beneficial effects of antidepressants.  This has lead to the hypothesis that perhaps the cessation of adult neurogenesis may be responsible for feelings of anxiety and depression.  I think I need to tighten up my hat these days.  I got up this morning at 5:30am, turned on the TV, and doozed while watching a West Wing re-run.   I feel less anxiety when the TV is on while I sleep.  I have no idea where this anxiety is coming from, but it is very real, and I wanted to burst into tears when I woke up and it was so early.  A friend of mine sent me one of those terrible emails that gets forwarded out to her entire emailing list.  It was about being twenty-something, and I wasn't going to read it (I almost never read anything that Elena sends out anymore), but I did, and did it ever sum things up for me.  I will paraphrase: I have no idea what I am doing anymore.  I am lost.  I AM LOST.  I used to watch movies with people spouting cheesy lines that they didn't know who they were, or that they were confused about life, and I used to think, "Who are these retards who don't know who they are?  How can you NOT know who you are?"  It turns out I was being a tad judgmental.  I feel like I am in a pool, swimming in the middle, and the end is getting further away from me, but turning around isn't an option, because where I started is even further away.  How did I get here?
