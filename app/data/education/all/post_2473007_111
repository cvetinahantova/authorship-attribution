I've posted some of the photos of his very first camping trip. Gosh. Every time I look at him I think he's the cutest thing on earth... Sad part about it all is that in a week my brother and his wife will be moving from Kentucky, which is no small jaunt from NY. At least I got a chance to spend time with him this first year. I hope he doesn't forget about his Unca' Jesse!
