WhooHoooooooo, do you know how few and far between date nights are around here?  I can't even remember the last date night.    Tonight Tommy told me to see if I can get a sitter for tomorrow night,and we will go out.  Either to eat or to a movie. With no kids.  Just the two of us.  No kids. (too poor for both)  I am sooooooooo excited.    NO kids, what will we do with NO KIDS around????????  What will we talk about, how will we act without a 6 yr old prying his skinny little body between us. In fact, no kids at all.  How on earth will we get thru the night without having to split up a fight, or referee an arguement between boys?????????????  This calls for a celebration. (no kids)  I feel the works coming on, hair, makeup, get all dressed up, re-do my nails, the fancy unmentionables, splash on a little victoria's secret smelly stuff, put on my new shoes, oooohhhhh, I need new earrings, got to have sexy earrings.  Did I mention NO KIDS??????????  Do you men see what you put us thru???? Just for a date????????   ONce more, did I mention   N-O K-I-D-S???????????????????
