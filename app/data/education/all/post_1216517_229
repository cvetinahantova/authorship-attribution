it's been said, and heard by many of us, those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it.... or something to that extent. well friends i think that we are (aside from religious beliefs) looking at another sign of the end of the american civilization.  i was listening to  urlLink studio 360 , a program on  urlLink npr , this last weekend and i heard something that got me thinking about this. let me start out by saying that this didn't really shock me perse, but it made realize that are group of friends is once again an acception to the rule.  the full text of this commentary can be found at  urlLink this link . but here are some highlights from kurt anderson's piece:   We all saw the recent news stories about the big decline in the percentage of Americans who read fiction or poetry or drama. Back in 1982, a large majority of people said they read a work of literature that year. And now, just two decades later, it's less than half that.  Reading fiction – any kind of fiction, from Jackie Collins to Stephen King to Philip Roth – has officially become a minority taste in America .  What's more, this decline appears to be accelerating – nearly the entire drop occurred in just the last decade.  The new study was undertaken by the National Endowment for the Arts.
