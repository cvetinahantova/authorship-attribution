The bike sale went OK and I now have 1550 UKP towards a small car. The paperwork for the voluntary termination of my existing car has also arrived, so things are beginning to move forwards. When Sandra got home she gave me a newspaper clipping of a dealer advert for a brand new car for 99 UKP per month with 5 years 0% finance. I thought it was a bit naughty of her to "tempt" me with another finance deal, so I asked her if we could afford it. She said we could afford 99 UKP/month once the money had come through from the mortgage. I said I would prefer to put the money in a savings account for a year instead, thus having another 1200 towards a better car next year - she seemed in favour, and I was quite surpised at my excitement at wanting to save.
