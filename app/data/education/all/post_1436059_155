Hey ya'll. It's been a while, eh? Ummm...we had a meet today. I did some middle-distance relays and a sprint medly, and I did fine but I've fully come to terms that I am a one-mile, two-mile, and three-mile runner the best. Some of the guys on the back of the bus on the way home were being incredibly stupid and freestyling. Coach N asked them to stop and they mocked her and acted really obnoxious. I hope Coach N doesn't quit, because those cocky boys with senioritis are really getting on her nerves more than they are getting on anyone else's nerves.   FOURTH PERIOD ENGLISH ROCKED!!!
