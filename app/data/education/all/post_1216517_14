So I'm living in Antelope Valley now.  It's not too bad.  Dollar theaters.  Target.  Wal-mart.  What else do you need?   I've eaten chili dogs the past few days and my  urlLink insides  don't approve.  Bad dining decisions on my part.  Not as bad as eating water buffalo testicles when I was in Thailand, but it's bad nonetheless.
