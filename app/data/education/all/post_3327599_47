who doesn't know that song?! other then Phil.. cuz.. he's old.. of all ppl Teri should know it.. that and jingle bells.. and john deere green.. and whatever other song might be stuck in her head at any given moment! i miss having lunch together..  soo today was eventful.. i babysat Sam, my baby cuzin, he's so cute but i'm definetly glad i got to send him home! my grandparents came over to whine. janie is having surgery on the 9th and is completely apalled that we are not cancelling our vacation to be here. and she's also upset about me not asking her to take care of my aminals. AND to whine about us going to Houston. i don't know if i want to go.. i'm not saying i like tulsa but it's been my home for the past 6 yrs and its weird thinking about living some where else.. but i guess i did it before right? anyway.. i hung out with sheila for a bit and then i went to Phil's. then we went in search of some arcade.. it's IN the mall.. not BY the mall.. for future reference. and since we never did find it we went and got ice cream instead. i haven't gone out for ice cream in a long time. anyway! after that i took him over to his friends house and i went home!   in john deere green on a hot summer night he wrote billy bob loves charlene letters three foot high and the whole town said he shoulda used red but it looked good to charlene.. in john deere green.. that's stuck in my head.. so is ring ring ring ring ring ring banana phone.. make the madness stop!
