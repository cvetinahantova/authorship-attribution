what a day!  i haven't gotten a decent sleep ever since monday because of the thousand things i had to do...and still i'm not yet done with everything...i'll be so so so happy come sem-break...  today in the montessori training i'm having, we took the edwards personal preference psych test..this is actually the only time somebody explained to me what the results meant (even though i've taken it around 10 times already, i think)..but now that i know, i'm not sure if i'll be happy or not..the overall test result is 85% reliable..i'm an achiever (as expected), dominant, and wants to be taken cared of (so true!). but then it also said that i'm not sorry for my wroingdoings and that i'm not loyal to my friends..i know i'm loyal to my friends for one thing. that's why considering that the interpretation was 85% reliable, i'm having mixed feelings right now....  after the long exam and interview with the head principal, i wanted to unwind so i went to buy my toiletries at makati supermarket..while i was paying for my items and thinking of how i'll go home if it's raining hard outside, dad called me and said marc's in the area that's why i can ride home with him. so i texted marc and he passed by the supermarket's entrance to pick me up. i'm just so glad he can now do things like that for me. i used to be very jealous of him since he's the only one among us dad will ever trust our car (and even our SUV) with..even though i took two (yes, two!) sessions of driving lessons and now have my driver's license with me..i think when i'm given the chance to finally drive, i might need a refresher course again..sad really..i already learned the skill but i wasn't given the opportunity to practice it..=(  still, i'm really thankful marc was there for me when i needed him this afternoon..  now, i have to go back to typing papers..another early class tomorrow..gosh..  evitz can hardly wait to get some decent sleep and much-needed pampering..
