alright, so the first step is admitting the addiction, right?  okay...here it goes...my name is kerry and i am a jak & daxter addict.   ah, i feel better getting that off my chest ;)  anyway, i played non-stop today from about 6 to 11.  then i came up to my room to watch donald in mathmagic land to see if i should show it in one of my classes thursday.  as i was getting ready for bed around midnight, the boys called me up.  turns out that they are stranded on some exit ramp in the cities.  so, i went to rescue them and on the way got super lost because i have such stellar direction sense.  finally, i found them and brought them home.  since i had been out and about i could no longer sleep, like usual, and so i decided to play jak & daxter once again.  i'm still not tired and it's already past 2 in the morning.  i don't know what to do.  i only came up here because they all came downstairs and told me i needed to go to bed.  nice of them to be concerned, i guess.  i said something about having insomnia and a guy that was visiting said that it's only insomnia if it is effecting your life in a negative way...and i said it was.  so the roommate that i've been "arguing" with said something about why it was effecting my life.  i asked why and he told me he didn't want to get into it.  i don't understand.  why is everybody so afraid to tell me anything?  yet another night of being kept in the dark and more confused....bring it on...
