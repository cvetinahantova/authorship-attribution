This wonderful evening of laughter and swimming was ended harshly with the new reality that is TCBY. On the way home for our grandmotherâ€™s house, my Big brother and myself decided to go to TCBY to get a smoothie and milkshake. Much to our disdain, the service was minimal and I must say, appalling. I ordered a 'Berry Blast' smoothie and it turns out the ice was all frozen together, so the worker had to go the nearby Sonic to retrieve some ice to make my nonetheless watery smoothie. Right now, my smoothie is busy hardening in the freezer. In conclusion, BOYCOTT TCBY!!
