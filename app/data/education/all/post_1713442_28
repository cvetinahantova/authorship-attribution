urlLink A Brief History of Library Instruction in the United States of America   As I enjoy this last weekend before classes begin on campus, I take a moment to reflect on those who helped create library instruction as we know it today in the USA.

For example, it is hard to imagine that the librarians at the Great Library of Alexandria did not assemble from time to time small groups of students and visiting scholars and instruct them on the proper handling and use of the valuable scrolls that resided there. Throughout most of history librarians have been members of other professions (the clergy and scholars of various disciplines) who took on the additional duty of maintaining the library collection of their institutions.
