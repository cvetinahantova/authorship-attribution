Hmmm...Wine...Lots of it!!!      Okie dokie, so on Saturday night I went to a German wine tasting.  Yes, I know I am in Japan but that's just the type of wine they were featuring. After some brief explanations on how to evaluate the different types and the proper ways of tasting, the drinking began.  Well, the night potentially could have included 10 different types of white wine.  However, after having tried 8 and then been told the two remaining were not the greatest, I decided to return to my favorites for a second taste just to confirm my original thoughts.  While I had arrived at the wine tasting with Jemma and her JTE (Yuko couldn't make it in the end due to a funeral), I left the wine tasting with Kristel and Sharon.  With a nice little buzz going, somehow the night managed to continue but for that you will have to continue reading another post (or perhaps you have already read based on the way this thing posts).
