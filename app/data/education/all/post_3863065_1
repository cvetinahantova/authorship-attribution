Who would have thought Frogs could be so noisy!  I live 3 floors above two rice fields.  There are two more rice fields to the right and two more to the left...plus a million other fields placed everywhere else!  Every night, pretty much as soon as the sun goes down, they start croaking.  No, not just a little, not just a few...EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.  You can even hear them through the closed windows!  The one night, around 11:30 or so, I was sitting on the couch reading and could hear the train go by.  At 1:00 the train was still going by...What the hell?  Here it was a few of the frogs, must have been big suckers, that sounded like a train going by!  I mean, how  big  were/are these frogs??  I've run over a few of the little ones with my car...not purposely of course :)  I just can't serve all over the road avoiding the little buggers!  It's not my fault they are sitting in the middle of the road waiting to be run over!  ;)  The first few nights and still to today, it's quite difficult to fall asleep!  They are so loud, sometimes they take a little break and are actually quiet, so just as you are about to fall asleep cause there is silence....'CROAK' and they all start up again!  They usually stop around 4:00AM when it is starting to get light out!  I hope they leave soon!
