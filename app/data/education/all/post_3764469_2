I have a big problem with the Php5.50 jeepney fare.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the jeepney fare increase. I think it's only fair. I had always thought that by not increasing the fare earlier, we're not getting as much out of it as much as what is being lost by the jeepney drivers. And I always had a problem with oil deregulation; you could find a bunch of arguments about the topic, but to me it's a matter of the government letting jeepney drivers shoulder losses that oil companies are not willing to take.  But all of that's beside the point. Here's my beef with the jeepney fare being Php5.50:  IT'S FRICKING 5.50!!!   There have been many theories about why the the prices have been increased to Php5.50, the most popular being that the President was playing politics with the jeepney drivers and throwing them a bone in exchange for their support. But why Php5.50?  Personally, I think the higher-ups are screwing with the jeepney drivers. Could you imagine being a jeepney driver at 6 in the afternoon, rush hour in Cubao? Your jeep is packed tighter than Diana Zubiri's tube top, the MMDA officer is leering at you like you're Joyce Jimenez, the dude beside you has worse B.O. than your favorite Bumbay, it looks like it's going to rain, and everyone else around you is driving like a maniac (it's always their fault). You're handed a twenty and a fifty, one's for three fares and the other's for five. Quick, how much do you give back to each? No calculators or pens, and no counting with fingers, either. And you still have to *actually* drive and get the people to where they're going safely, remember?  I'm thinking about it, and it makes *my* head hurt. And I used to go out with a physicist.  I really hope the prices for oil don't increase anymore, for the sake of the poor drivers. If they ask for another price increase, the government could really fuck them up for good. Like, peg the fare at Php6.75.
