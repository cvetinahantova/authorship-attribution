For your love, i would do anything.  Just to see the smile upon your face [Stevie Wonder - For your love]  This heart overflows of all the things You have placed inside of it. Your love, Your deeds  of old and new, Your words, Your promises of things unseen: they overwhelm me with their possibilities.   With simple thoughts, I make known Your miracles. Of babes nursed in Your arms, Of elders held in Your embrace, how time and place gather all in this single moment  to live in everlasting burnings, incendium amoris.   But give care to the young men.  Where the sweet flame burns, let your eyes always return.  Let your eyes relive the beginning and the end. The cares of the battle   rest much easier in the brightness of  His coming.   So once more oh God, let Your love come down to flesh and bone, to  men whose spirits are  easily dismayed. Then,  new wine shall be made, new songs shall be sung, to Your praise and everlasting glory. For no deed shall ever be as great, as those that Your love has inspired.
