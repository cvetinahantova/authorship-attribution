It is one of the frustrations of being a humanist/ urlLink Bright , that we don't fit very well into the otherwise religious categories. Our presence is given a nod in the ugly phrase 'of all religions and none'. The 2001 urlLink  UK Census  says there are 14.6% who described themselves as 'of no religion', the second largest group after those who ticked 'christian'. So how are these people to be represented when goverment and others wish to consult? The philosopher  urlLink Daniel Dennett  amusingly  urlLink commented  that organising atheists is like trying to herd cats. In the public arena, I think we can work with the word 'belief' if not 'faith'.  Is it not true that humanists have beliefs? In fact I would go as far as to say that we therefore must be 'believers'. I must say that even in this cheeky mood I find it hard to say that I am part of a 'faith-community'. I will not for the moment push the idea that we have 'faith', as the word so often means believing in the face of contrary evidence. But we DO have beliefs. I wonder if a good approach to explaining humanism is that the difference in our beliefs is  where we get them from . Isn't this the crucial, central question, from which all others radiate? A public presentation might include asking those present how they 'know' things in general, and asking pertinent questions about whether, for example one 'knows' something because someone in authority says so, or because millions of people believe it, etc. I'm a believer!
