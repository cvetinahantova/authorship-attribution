Even though the game clock is not expired, it's safe to say that the Detroit Pistons are going to win the NBA Finals. Two minutes left, 98-79 in favor of Detroit.   Four future hall-of-famers failed to meet expectations (especially Gary Payton).   The Pistons simply played as a better team unit.   May the Lakers revamp as a franchise and EARN an NBA Championship within the next few years. Management must find quality talent that is willing to play hard consistently. The end of their dynasty has come (some argue that it ended last year against the Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals).   At least my Dodgers (a regular source of disappointment), are up 4-0 and still in first place in the NL West (albeit by percentage points).
