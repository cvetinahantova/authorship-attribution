I used a new layout. Yay. I got bored with the other.  Yesterday I ran seven miles, then went to see Spiderman2 with Brian, Corynne, and Joseph (aka...JOEY). It was okay. Ehhh. Then we went to see Brian's show, but I was exhausted from running and waking up early and Corynne was tired from donating blood earlier.  Not much else going on...a rather dreary fourth of July, however. Happy 228th, America. It's a good one, isn't it?
