urlLink Democracy Now! | Fmr. U.S. Special Forces Officer Describes Arresting Current Coup Leader in 1994   This is an interview with a special forces officier that I have met.  He is a rarity...a US military veteren who is a political revolutionary.  Good stuff on Haiti who are the "liberators" the US helped to reinstall in haiti.  This is not a step toward freedom.    Do not be distracted by criticism of Aristide's followers,  No excuse for the military overthrow of the democratically elected government.
