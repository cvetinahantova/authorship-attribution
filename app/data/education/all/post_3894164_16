It seems that everyone has their own Web Blog nowadays. I figured I might as well join the craze and get my own. Next thing you know I will have a webpage completely devoted to myself. I am vain but not quite that bad.  Anyways, with one week to go until the Democratic National Convention I felt compelled to setup a Blog so that people will be able to keep up with my progress out in Boston. I only hope that I will be able to post on this blog often enough during those two weeks.  I have to be honest and say that I am a little nervous, having never flown before. Better late than never though. It should be a fun time out east, I really enjoyed the last time I was out there and am looking forward to this trip. This trip can definitely have a lasting impact on my life.   I just recently read the book,  urlLink Fifty-Two simple ways to make a difference , written by the late United States Senator from Illinois  urlLink Paul Simon . This is a man that is very inspirational. There are alot of tips in this book on how to make a difference in the world. It is amazing the little things that can be done to change the world around you. It is a relatively quick read, and I highly recommend it to all of you. I will definitely try to take some of his suggestions to heart.
