You appear through the mundane - a world of lines, libraries, and airplanes You leave me with no choice but to stare at your seductive green eyes and dark curly hair. You adorn yourself with mall-purchased clothing; olive pants and a white tank-top, from Abercrombie. I need to meet you and converse on a walk but have not the courage to you to talk You must adore film and The Doors and want to live in a California home with a jacuzzi and hardwood floors...  However anxiety convinces me to let you remain a mystery
