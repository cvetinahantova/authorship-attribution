lets start with a foo fighter line, that played in my head, after sending her home..  "Someone's always someone elsest one.. ... ... You're not the one, but you're the only one, who can make me feel like this.."  i guess i've found that someone.. someone who was lonely as i, someone whom i made mine, someone who make my days go by, someone whom i like looking in the eye, someone who needs me, someone whom i can't live without, someone who made my other half, someone whom i made full, someone who misses me infinitely, someone whom i miss beyond eternity, soemone who can stand my nonscence, someone whom i will stand up for, someone who's name is close to my heart, someone who's name is Shazleen..  that summarizes it, doesn't it? I MISS YOU..
