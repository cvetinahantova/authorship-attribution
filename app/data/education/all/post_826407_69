Had a great time in Manchester yesterday with my Helen, My Brothers Tom and Francis and Tom's fiance Naomi.  We spent most of the day wandering round the city, I like that.  Often in Cities you are trying to get somewhere in particular so you rush but just wandering lets you see stuff you'd normally miss.    Went to some of the  urlLink Festive Manchester Christmas Markets .  The best one was the European Market.  It was full of christmassy food so the tastes and smells were great.    Great to see you again guys, thanks.
