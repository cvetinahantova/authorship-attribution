With an e-mail I received earlier today from  urlLink EBay  I was reminded that the used good site they own,  urlLink Half.com , will be integrated into the parent site.  (This will happen in October according to the note/press release.  See this  urlLink note .) As someone who purchases almost everything related to entertainment (books, music, DVD's) online I hope that the convenience (and cheap prices) will not go away. (This  urlLink older article  reminds us of how long it's been since the merger first started.)  Tonight I (re-)experienced this convenience firsthand.  After misplacing a textbook (an older edition of a computer networking book) that I'm using for one of my classes, I decided to order a replacement copy.  (The book is important and I've already been looking for the book for a couple days.  My certainty in ever locating it is dwindling.)  Looking at  urlLink Barnes and Noble , which I usually use for new purchases I was shocked at the price for a new book of $115. (This shouldn't be a surprise for a textbook.)  I then chose to look at EBay.  They had several copies for $5-$10 (and a Buy It Now one for $25 or $35.)  I went to Half.com and found one for under $5 which I reserved and will hopefully get by early next week.  While their main site certainly offers some great deals, here's hoping that EBay chooses to incorporate the Half.com inventory into their own EBay Store feature (or their new "Half-Off" feature, as they call it)and allow customers to still get access to such a wide selection of products, often at dirt cheap prices compared to the big retailers like BN.
