hello everyone,  well it feels great to be on vacation.  i don't have to work again until  next monday.  there is a big aids conference here in bangkok and i think  they are trying to encourage people to leave town to cut down on traffic.   anyway...  everything is going great no poop incidents yesterday.  i've  begun playing games that encourage the girls to work on their pronunciation.    thai children/people have difficulty with the r and l sounds so words like  river and liver come out sounding the same.  i think the girls enjoyed it so  i'm going to continue with as many games as possible.  other than that not much to tell.  i might miss a message or two this week  but my mobile should work if anyone needs to hear my voice.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ FREE pop-up blocking with the new MSN Toolbar Â– get it now!  http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200415ave/direct/01/
