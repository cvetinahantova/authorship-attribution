"Man, it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she had, but it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all"   All hail the return of Dashboard Confessional and the gloriously bittersweet "Carve Your Heart Out Yourself". Huzzah, I say, and again, huzzah. From what I've heard of "A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar", Chris Carraba has decided to use instruments that you can actually plug in this time around, which I'm sure is very new and exciting for him.  I have discovered a new comic! It's called  urlLink Ctrl+Alt+Del  and it's laugh-out-loud funny. It's about this computer games geek Ethan, his best friend and roommate Lucas and his other roommate, whose name I can't remember, and the other roommate's pet penguin, Ted. It is based a lot around computer games so some parts of the story I don't get, but the jokes are still universally funny. Huzzah.  On a more ominous note, my horoscope reads: "If some fickle personage has been meddling with your heart strings in the last month or two, the tide turns this week." Gulp. JYF is this weekend. Gulp. The R-word springs to mind...  Gulp x   Oh look now, there you go with hope again...
