Heh... Anyway, NT Class is going as usual, and I just found out that I already passed it. All you have to do to pass it is keep yourself busy and get at least 20% on one of the tests. I got a 44%, so I pretty much kicked it's ass. I think I already posted that at some point, but whatever.  Anyway, I was trying to install XP and it didn't work so I'm somewhat fizzed (yes, fizzed. Don't ask). Yep. Right. Ok. Woo. Nate got BF1942 working finally, so we played for a few minutes. That was interesting. Oh, and I played with Adobe Photoshop for a bit, and I'm starting to learn how to use it, but I still need some work. I'm still a PSP wizard (haha!).  Current Music: Shinedown - 45
