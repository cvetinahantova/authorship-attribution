I am getting a new puppy!   Not Bali, as I originally intended.  Another mini dashchund though, but a reddish brown color, not black and tan.  She is seven weeks right now but I will be getting her in a little over two weeks.  She is being shipped from Georgia.  I didn't know they shipped puppies, but I guess they do.  It's very safe and temperature controlled, don't worry.   I need a name for her now.  I had a boy dog name all picked out, but no idea about a girl dog name.  Suggestions welcome, but nothing typical.
