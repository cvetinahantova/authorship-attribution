I have a new favorite book  I read  urlLink The Time Traveler's Wife   while I was on vacation. What a fabulous book. I can see why it's been spending so much time on these bestseller lists. It's one of those books that make me gnash my teeth with envy. Why didn't *I* come up with that? She deals with time travel, in the context of a love story, not as science fiction. It's just wonderful, engrossing and all that good stuff.
