Here is the root:  I cannot seem to connect with anyone. I just want to meet someone who understands my jokes.  I hate explaining my jokes.  And do people use metaphores anymore??!!  If you blush on a regular basis, and you know when something is ironic, email me: ironyismylife@hotmail.com.    There was a PSSST in the Coast a couple of weeks ago, posted by two girls.  It was something like: "Two nice female roommates want to find some un-sucky friends", or something, plus an email address.  Good luck ladies.  Good luck.  And now I am off to humiliate myself at ultimate frisbee.  Not because I can't play, but because I have to associate with the immature assholes who play ultimate.  Yeah, that's you buddy.  (BTW - if you missed it, the irony of that email address is that no one is actually going to contact me there.  Get it?  Get it?  Oh, fuck it.)
