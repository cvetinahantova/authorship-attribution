Pennsylvania - How embarrassing.  Blame it on my adhd, but a week without writing is sad.  But, alas, I am back.  My motd would have to be here in Pennsylvania and speaking at Downington High School West.  It was to the juniors and seniors.  They have a brand, spankin new school with a great auditorium and it was an all around great experience.  I return tonight to speak to the student leader banquet.  Great day.
