I don't think I've been this bored and/or restless since 7th grade, when I was a loner... This is so lame. Plus, I think I've gotten myself a fever from somewhere or other.  Oh, well. I'm just going to sit here and listen to music for a long time...  Current Music: Rocky Horror Picture Show - Rose Tint My World: Floor Show/Fanfare/Don't Dream It/Wild and Untamed
