. the danger of letting your prophets get in bed with your prostitutes .  i'm so upset by this news.  this is from  urlLink sojourners :    Disney slips a mickey to Michael Moore movie  The Walt Disney Company, corporate purveyor of mass-marketed media and entertainment, has pulled the plug on Michael Moore's latest film project, "Fahrenheit 9/11," which probes the Bush family's financial ties to illustrious Saudis (including Osama bin Laden's family), going back 30 years. Disney's Miramax division had financed the film and was set to release it this summer, when Disney CEO Michael Eisner objected, citing his fear of the movie's "partisan nature." Another top executive expressed concern that the politically provocative content would alienate some of the more conservative patrons of Disney entertainment. Moore and others critical of Disney's decision say Disney fears the controversial material in the documentary would jeopardize the company's tax breaks in the state of Florida, where Jeb Bush is governor.   Moore's anticipated release, following his blockbuster "Bowling for Columbine" (which grossed $22 million in North America) is rife with his signature predilection for hounding wealthy and elite profiteers and politicians. Disney has refused to renege on its decision not to promote the film, though it now appears that they will sell it back to Miramax for independent promotion.    Unbelievable! I was really banking on the populist appeal and the resonance of Micheal Moore's voice to help in the great unseating of November...  After perusing  urlLink Michael Moore's  website a little more, I see that this scandal has been in the press for about a month.  Where have i been ?!
