So I was supposed to be in a wedding last weekend, but it had to be postponed since the groom was in the hospital with intestine problems. It turns out that he had to be in the hospital for an extra week while he regained strength and ability to eat solid food. Then he went home for two days, then started bleeding internally and passed out. So his fiancee called 911 and they rushed him to the hospital, where he had to undergo another emergency surgery to stop the internal bleeding. That happened this past Thursday, and he's still unconscious (deliberately) while the doctors figure out what's going on.     I feel bad for M! She must be so stressed. At least his father flew in to help take care of the situation. While I spent time with her in the waiting room (playing the card game of Settlers of Catan), two doctors came to talk to her about the situation. It was very confusing, and each doctor seemed to be convinced that they were correct in their diagnosis and recommended treatments. I'm not sure how I would handle the situation if my partner were in the hospital with a life-threatening or otherwise serious condition. I would definitely want someone else there to figure out what was reasonable. I can't imagine how BB did it last year. It just seems like you really need to do as much research as possible.     M beat me twice at the card game. :-) That makes three defeats for me in the past week! Hmmm. I wonder how much of it is strategy and how much is luck!
