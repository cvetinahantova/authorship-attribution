Music: Some dark song... I donno the name or who sings it... Mood: tired...!! ***********************  Well, yesterday I had to go to Nikki's 15th birthday party... I've been to every one ever since I've known her! Well, she got the DVD of all the Guns and Roses Music Videos...! So ofcourse she watched it all night long...! Brittany and I talked about my relegion(wicca)... she said she thought it was interesting, but too complicated for her to do...!   We did this fainting thing that I used to do all the time... You bend over and breathe really heavy until you feel faint, then you stand up straight real fast and someone has to clinch your mouth and nose shut and make you faint. Then they tell you things and you start seeing it and freak out, or what ever... they told me that I was beating up this girl (Donna) and they said that I tried to get up...! I told them that if I stood up to try and wake me up or run and hide...!  >.>....they woke me up.... but not before I got a few good kicks at the girl...  I'm going to make an anti-emo orginazation... and it's gonna be kickass... they took over Hot Topic... Torrid... they've taken over tv... HATE THEM!! GRRR! *yawn* love all... sleepy!
