When I was younger (much, much younger), I had this book called something like "The Great Clean Up".  It was all about a girl whose room is a messy pit.  I think her mom tells her to clean it up and she has visions of running away.  Anyways, she does a big clean up (as the title would imply) and her room becomes perfectly organized.  I specifically remember her getting a large cardboard box which she uses to throw away a bunch of junk.  I loved that book.  Report card time is upon us.  As a result of this, and my procrastination as far as putting papers in my grade book, my classroom has many piles of papers everywhere.  I feel the urge to get a large cardboard box and start tossing.  Sigh.  What will actually happen is that I will dutifully enter scores from all of those papers tonight so I can start report cards tomorrow...  Then I'll get that large cardboard box and start the great room clean up.
