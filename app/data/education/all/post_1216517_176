Yeah, i'm still here.  I'm sick today though.  A cold.  Can ya believe it?  I've been though a dry spell in the writing dept.  hopefully I can kick that back up a notch.  I think I'm going to go to starbucks right now and write.  or at least try to.  we'll see.  I've applied to be an elementary teacher in the LA unified school district for next year.  I hope that works out.  I'd be working down in the city.  serious stuff, bro.  I think alot in the shower.  It's kind of like my office.  i get really good ideas in there.  So today i was deep in thought, the gears were really grinding up in mi cabeza.  So i turn the water off and start drying my hair.  I was so enraptured in my thoughts that I has forgotten to wash the shampoo out of my hair.  it was pretty stupid.  the lesson from this story?  I don't know.  I'll tell you later.  peace.
