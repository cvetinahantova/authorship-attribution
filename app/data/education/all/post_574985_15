urlLink Rob Williams  of  urlLink Campus Crusade for Christ's Global Technology Office  met with a small group of teens and young adults -- from middle school through college -- to find out about how they use technology to communicate. Rob posts gleanings from the conversation  urlLink here . Some snippets:     They use technology for communication first, entertainment second.   They like to use instant messaging. "I haven't seen a personal email in months," said one high school student. "My IM is on all dayâ€¦one at work and one at home"   They'll read emails -- if they're short.   Good insights, Rob. Thanks!
