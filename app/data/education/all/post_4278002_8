If you feel adventurous and think you may want to come and visit Nate and I, please consider flying into Hong Kong...      The Maryknoll House in Hong Kong is fantastic (hopefully you've checked out the picture of the ocean view we have) and they are open to us having visitors stay here for $25/night! Moms and Dads are free...      At this point, Nate and I aren't EXPECTING any visitors from "back home." We know that financially a round-trip ticket can turn anyone off, but if you do at any point feel inspired to check out another side of the world you can certainly let us know and we'd be happy to help with the arrangements...not to mention we will get lonely from time to time and would be delighted to see any of you show up on our Chinese doorstep. Just make sure to take off your shoes, would ya!?
