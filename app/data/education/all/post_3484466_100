Morning it be... well, late morning. Anyway, I'm still running on two power supplies, and I'm trying to decide what I'm going to do about it. I'm either going to make a little modification so I can mount that power supply inside my computer, and have two power cords (that would be pretty cool.... hehe) or I could buy a converter from whatever to peripheral or I could just cut off my floppy plug and grab a peripheral one from an old power supply and put it on there. Oh, or there's the new power supply idea.  The last two sound like the best ideas, but the first one sounds like it would be cool... two power supplies... hehe. Anyway, I'm not going to work on that until later today. For now, I'm just going to run it with the case open, and overclock my video card some more.  Current Music: Franz Ferdinand - Auf Achse
