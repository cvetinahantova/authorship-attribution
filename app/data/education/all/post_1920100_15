MAKING CONNECTIONS  Hey everyone! Today was a crazy day. I started with my new class. It is a 4/5 English immersion class. The day went well with the students. They already know me so they knew exactly what to expect. The testing process didn't even begin. That is good. But, as far as responsibilities their is a lot of work I have to do to finish off the year. I had been talking to various teachers and they were being considerate and offered me some encouragement. I didn't feel better until I met with the principal. Luckily, now I feel more confident in what I need to get done to meet some deadlines. Today was open house but I did not attend. I hope it went well. I instead went to bible study at 4 square church.  The Connections.... Today I was so happy because finally I got in contact with my dear friend from Washington Rhema. Man I really enjoy her friendship. She sent me some beautiful emails and we got a chance to share. We had both been busy and let some time pass by but we talked and we both agreed that we won't let that happen anymore. I really missed her a lot. Thanks Amiga. Dios Te Bendiga Y Guie tu camino siempre.  Well I got connected with a few people from the chuch. They are having a lot of fellowship events I might attend. Saturday they are having a women meeting at 10:30am Sunday they are having "Fusion"  college night at church 7pm Monday they are having Life Groups (prayer, accountability groups) 7pm.  I also was able to talk to the youth pastor. This church is cool they are a lot of nice people.  Scripture verse to think about: "Pray without ceasing. . ." (1 Thessalosians 5:17)
