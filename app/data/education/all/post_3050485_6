legal writing is normally bad writing. reading cases makes my head spin. most legal decisions are just awful, save of course decisions penned by isagani cruz. why is that? i guess the intent is to mystify the law, make it sound esoteric so that normal people would end up with a numbing head ache, and thus leave all the legal deciphering to lawyers. honestly, why not call a spade a spade directly without resorting to inefficient and ineffectual legalese? why not say white when the color is white, and not anymore slip to mumbo jumbo bullshit that really is just specious and stupid. i wish they cut all the crap, make it all simple, in that way more could appreciate the law.   i remember one said that in law school if you cannot dazzle them with brilliance baffle them with bullshit. maybe there is a need to speak straight yet with substance. in that way we could do away with statutory construction.
