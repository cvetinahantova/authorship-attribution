i'm giving up on the whole title thing i can never think of anything to put there.. Anywho.. after reading Amy's post from this morning i have been wondering.. am i one of the hott friends Matt was referring to? i bet i was haha! jk. that would be cool and would definetly inflate my ego (like i need any help with that..) It's a shame he has to leave today he seems like he's a really cool guy and he reminds me of Aaron McQuarry like you wouldn't believe.. my dog is stuck..  why is it that the same 3 ppl are always online...
