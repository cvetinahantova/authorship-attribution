urlLink Tales from the MSU Stacks  I did an orientation for new faculty the other day.  I did a stand up act that delivered my information but still kept them entertained.  As I work on delivering orientation information to different groups on campus, I remember the big project I worked on at Michigan State University back in 2000.  The Tales from the MSU Stacks tutorial has 30 minutes of video (good PBS TV station filmed and edited video) with some web links and interactive content. I am still amazed how well it came out.  It also does a good job of entertaining students.  Be warned, if you don't have a digital or network Internet connection, the streaming video may be too much for you to download and view.
