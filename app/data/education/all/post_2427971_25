Here's the journal I kept from last year, can't remember what's there... But it's there!  December 18, 2002 	I’m waiting for mom to get off the dam phone at the moment so I thought I would make a journal, relieve some stress.  	I’ve been going after Lynne for quite some time now and I think she’s finally giving in.  She’ll be at the next LAN Party I’m praying.  God, I don’t understand why I’m so incredibly attracted to her, I mean she’s really hot and sweet and all that other shit but it was so sudden. Have all these years of loneliness finally caught up with me? That is quite defiantly a possibility, I’ve been fine for all my life so why now?  Oh well, I’m having the time of my life!  Zak got mad after I told him I was going to ask her out because he thought he could’ve gotten her. I don’t know about that, it doesn’t seem like he’s her type of person.   	 	Ok, now Zak is way too immature for his age.  He says it’s to piss me off but it’ll be there for a while I know it.  I really wish he would mature A LOT, and lighten up on Nathan.  Whenever Zak is being all immature everyone tells him to stop but he just ignores them and keeps stealing peoples stuff because he want’s more attention.  But whenever Nathan does it and Zak isn’t in the mood he yells at Nathan and insults him in any way possible most likely to make himself feel superior in some way.  He always needs to be right, and when he's wrong we starts to either attack you in some way or insult you.    	Those are the pretty much the only bad things about him, overall he’s a really great friend.  I’m lucky to know him *talk about mood swings*.  He and I are going to start an Airsoft Team, that is if I get a gun after what I told Dad.  For the records, I asked for an airsoft gun for Christmas(MP5SD5) and he made a deal with me.  For every C I get I pitch in $50.00 toward the gun, it was $330.00, that includes shipping.  Anyway, I sent him an E-Mail telling him I had all A’s and B’s when I actually had C’s and a D.  So when progress reports came my mom got mad, like she usually does, and had me get progress reports every friday.  Knowing that my dad would see the grades eventually I called him up to tell him, but didn’t have the guts to spit it out.  After the phone call I took a shower and thought it would be a lot easier if I were to E-Mail him, god was it ever.  This happened today so I am now waiting anxiously for a phone call or an E-Mail.  I’m relaxed for some reason though, it feels like he’ll be glad I told him myself and work out another deal with him.  I shouldn’t be saying that though, I don’t want to jinx it.  	Basically, right now life sucks, but everyone has their moments and this is one of them.  I’m really worried about dad’s reaction to me E-Mail, he is the coolest most caring person I know but he has his limits.  I don’t want to lose his trust in me, we’ve had it so good for years and I may have just ruined it.  Please god, give me some slack this one time.  Being shy SUCKS, coming on to Lynne when I’m still not sure she likes me is tough but I’m gonna keep going until she either tells me to stop or lets me date her.  Lynne can not be described, she makes me so happy when I’m with her and I can’t help but look at her eyes.  Lynne makes my life easier and more enjoyable, she keeps me up at night for hours by just existing.  This may sound like I’m an obsessed maniac but I think about her 24/7.  I don’t think any of this shows in the way I talk to her or look at her, all because I’m shy.  “Sleep, those little slices of death, how I loath them” 					-Edgar Allan Poe  December 19, 2002  	It’s way too fucking late to put anything down right now, not even a quote so good-fucking-night!  December 20, 2002 	At LAN Party!  December 21, 2002  	Yesterday was the start of the best LAN Party we’ve ever held, it was at Nathan’s house in his garage.  It was perfect, the warmest part of the house apparently, there was no shortage of warmth.  Then got into a snowball fight with Alex and her friend, then my hands got so cold that the snow started feeling warm, weird.  I got really good at my Undead strategy with the mass Skeleton Warriors.  One comp is really easy now, so when I get really good I’ll start on two, which will be a feat to everyone else.  	Lynne called this morning sick off her ass, I felt so bad that I couldn’t do anything.  She has a really high fever and was throwing up all last night, then after she threw up everything there was to throw up she’d just start to gag.  Fuck, I couldn’t do a single fucking thing to help her.  I’m kinda worried that it will get worse, I really want her to feel her best before Christmas at least, I love Lynne.  I’m starting to get some bad thoughts, I’m gonna quit for now.  “Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there... Wondering... Fearing... Doubting...”  	-Edgar Allan Poe  January 14, 2003  	It’s about fucking time that I write some shit.  I have some catching up to do, sometimes I just don’t feel like typing.  Well, this thing with Lynne is getting stupid.  I’m sure she wants to go out with me but can never get to Bend, so I think that I’ll just chill.  I’ll just ask her if she thinks if it would ever work out, I wonder what she’d say.  	Fuck! I snapped my fucking gun in half this weekend, I am so pissed. I can’t tell dad, he’ll flip after the big conflict with us.  I think I’ll just epoxy it as a sub for now until I get a metal body for it and just replace it.  God, I hope this works out in the end.  When I slide it back together it seems fine even when I shoot it, the only problem I found was when I shoot it on Full Auto after I stop a few BB’s fall out of the barrel.  Arron said something is loose, I can’t remember what.  I’ll just keep buying parts to replace the broken ones and every other one for maximum durability.  	This week\end I’m gonna try to get a job at the Disk Space.  I think that would be a cool to have a job there, they build comps which I can do pretty easily and sell games which I’ve been playing since Prince of Persia on the Power Mac.  Maybe Hartke’s class will help with applying for this job or any other.  I really hope I get this job, it would help in so many ways.  	I have concluded that you can’t fully trust anyone, eventually they’ll turn on you in some way no matter what.  “Tourists are terrorists with cameras, terrorists are tourists with guns”                   - Anon  January 17, 2003 	 	Well, I never asked Lynne about the thing.  I don’t think it would have mattered, she’s starting to flirt a little more.  She may be able to do something this weekend, that would be so fucking awesome.  She is the only person that is actually nice to me, she’s so hot.  	Zak’s pissing me off again, he can’t do one simple thing for me.  I asked him to put Black Hawk Down on a CD and he take his sweet fucking time.  It takes him one week to even try to burn it on but gets an error, I guess that was just too much for him to handle.  Then this week he was sick so he compressed the first part of the movie ‘cause he couldn’t fit it on a CD.  Well, he never got past there, that little shit is the laziest moron I’ve ever known.  	As for my airsoft gun, I’m just gonna buy a new one.  I don’t feel like dealing with any hassle to fix it or buy the right metal body or internals.  It’ll cost less just to get a new one than to upgrade the shit out of it, I’ll trade the broken one to Arron for his Colt so I have a sidearm.  Ya, that’ll be pretty cool to have, a sidearm goin’ about 300 fps to your face.    	Havin’ a LAN Party on Sunday, we’ve got monday off.  John’s coming who I really don’t want to come, Zak invited him of course.  I guess he could be some more target practice for the real gamers, the core of the LAN Parties.  I’ve established that those gamers are Nathan, Zak, Alex, and I, we are ALWAYS there.  Even if there aren’t gonna’ be anyone but us we go anyway, good group.  We are also the airsoft group including Arron, the one who introduced airsoft to us god bless ‘im.  That be it!  “If you can’t beat ‘em, run ‘em over with a semi” 	- Jeremy Brookshire  January 18, 2003  	I can’t wait ‘til the LAN Party tomorrow, there’s going to be eight people there not including the one that may be able to come.  It’s gonna be so fucking fun, and Nathan put the sever on his other computer so there won’t be any more lag, ya!  Kenneth thinks he’s gonna kick all our asses at all the games we’ve have been playing at all the LAN Parties, bull shit!  Zak and I are the best at CS, I’m the best at Warcraft 3 and Nathan's pretty fucking good at Red Faction.  We sort of played Tribes but it just wasn’t much of a LAN Party type of game, it’s all right we just have better games to play.  	I tried drawing yesterday and I suck now, I’m really disappointed.  I just couldn’t think of anything to draw, my imagination is gone.  All these years of games got rid of all my ideas, it really does suck.  I’ll keep thinking of something, hopefully it’ll come up because I really want to start drawing again.  I have a feeling it’ll work out eventually.  	I still  haven’t gone and asked about a job at The Disk Space, I really need to.  Especially now that dad said I need to get one, he’s not forcing me but wants me to get one to help with Germany.  When I talked to him last week it it was really awkward, I knew he was thinking about me lying to him and he knew I knew.  It was awful, I don’t want to go to Phoenix next weekend.  This sucks.  “Work is a necessary evil to be avoided.” 	- Mark Twain  January 23, 2003  	Last night Lynne decided to stop talking to me because I called her a weirdo.  After she hung up last night I knew she was gonna call back in some way, she did.  About 20 minutes after she decided to I get a call from someone named Bailey, Taylor (Lynne).  So  picked up and heard a couple of people whispering, then Zak started talking.  I then knew she did some kind of 3-way dealy with the phone.  I told Zak that I had caller ID and Lynne got pissed that she forgot to block her call, that’s just like her.  She’s great, I love ‘er.  	I finally got a laser pen, YES!  Vic has a fit when he sees it, it’s great.  Not much else to say.  “It’s always better to die trying than to quit before the end.” 	- RedCell  February 25, 2003  	It’s probably time to write some more... So here's the shit!  	Lynne’s a really good friend, love ‘er.  I’m starting to hang out with Nathan’s friends, it’s fun.  They’re really nice and I always have a good time with them.  Among them is a girl, really cute, she reminds me of Lain.  I’m pretty sure she likes me cause we’ve been extending smiles for a couple days, now the only thing I need is the courage to talk to her.  Once again, being shy sucks ass!  I just have to do it, it’s not a difficult task for Christ’s sake.  I need to break out of my shell and just talk to her, she won’t bite my head off.  I wish I wasn’t shy, it really sucks... Ok, I’ll talk to her tomorrow and I will not hesitate.  I must not hesitate, if that happens I will end up not talking to her.  	Everyone are asses to Nathan and I’m the only one to defend him, no one else.  He’s gotten used to it, but I will back him up every time he’s criticized.  They don’t realize the fact that he can kick them out of LAN Parties since he is the LAN Party host/manager.  He’s becoming more friendly and less annoying than Zak, which may or may not be a good thing.  Well, as long as he doesn’t turn on me or decide to stop hosting LAN PArties it’s all good.  	It was about time I put something in here, that’s it for now. Until next time.  “Only the dead have seen the end of war.” 	-Plato  February 26, 2003  	Thought that Id make a code, I’m bored so it makes perfect sense.

First off, me and Lynne stopped talking after the first semester ended.  It does suck but I don’t think it matters to her, no problem.  We say ‘hi’ in the halls and stuff but that's about it.  I think she’s going out with Clint, or was.  Anyway, she was/is a good friend and I should probably call her again some time so we can catch up.  	My B-day was pretty fun, ate lots of food and I subconsciously started cleaning at 3:00 in the morning.  I don’t know why but I did, it was pretty effective too!  We had so much fun, in fact it spanned al the way through the next day.  Nathan was the last one to leave, he left at 10:00 pm.  What fun we all had and I got some kick ass presents, such as: Boosters(Alex and Alex), 16 GIG certificate(Zak), Networking and power strips(Nathan), Trigun DVD Box Set(Adrian) and Dane brought his console stuff.  	That is about everything that has happened, not much at all really.  “Our parents ruin the first half of our lives, our children ruin the second”. 	-Someone  July 3, 2003  	I’m back from Germany and I had a fucking good time.  I think Vreden was the best, Maximilian made sure I had fun every day.  I got drunk a couple times which was one of the best parts of the trip, of course coming after Kesh.  I gave her a note with my number, I really hope she goes out with me.  She said she likes and wants me, unfortunately she was drunk at the time so I don’t know if it really true.  We do flirt a lot, lots of tickling, touching and that crap.  I hope she calls today so I can have a conclusion to the subject, that would be nice.  	Zak got a summer love as well, as  Blanton told me.  Better yet a gaming love.  That is so awesome, I’m happy for him.  He tried to get a girlfriend all of sophomore year and it’s finally caught up to him.  I want to meet her and see what she's like.
