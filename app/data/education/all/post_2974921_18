i remember my parents telling me falling in love was caring for someone so much. so, i guess...maybe..at some point, i am in love.  jammi was so sweet to send me an e-card with a poem of his. i feel so good yet undeserving. i mean, me, a "player" to him, a good guy? i'm gonna do my best to make this work. i feel so...uh..shall i say, blessed? i'm too inspired to write. ust wanna blog out how happy i am.
