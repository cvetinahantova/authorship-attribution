Scott, I tell you what:  if the Red Sox beat anyone in the World Series, I'll buy you a steak dinner out of the sheer desire to rub it in your face.  I'll assume your DH argument is facetious and that, in the event  that the Cubs win it all, you will buy me a steak dinner in your own curseless ecstasy.
