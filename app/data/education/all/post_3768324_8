My office didn't have Internet for essentially 99 percent of the workday. It was hysterical to watch people justify their lack of work (myself included) because of the Internet being down. What did people do before the Internet? I really have no idea.  An old woman in my office was noted to tell a coworker with regards to a magazine cover, "Look at this Lindsay Lohan. 17, and look at these knockers!" I laughed my ass off.  Gagne finally blew a save. In reality, I don't care - the Dodgers still suck, except for Milton Bradley and Adrian Beltre. While Gagne is an amazing closer, he already killed this record, and at some point it had to end... it's just a shame it had to be to the DBacks, managed by Mets retread Al Pedrique.  I'm glad Edwards got picked, because in reality, could you see Tom Vilisack as President of the United States?  There's a segment on SportsCenter where some high school senior committed to Duke e-mailed Coach K about how much Coach K means to Duke. Apparently, this swayed the decision. Right. I'm sure the fact that the Lakers will suck next year also swayed the approach; I must admit though, the segment has tug-at-the-heartstrings potential.  Last night, I read a book called "What Your Sixth Grader Needs to Know" which contained a diverse section on American history. It's amazing how stupid I am, in that I understood the Vietnam war better from a 3 paragraph description than I did from the months I covered it in HS social studies / history classes.  I watched a segment on ABC about life in the minor leagues last night. Amazing. Did you know Mitch Williams is the coach of the Atlantic City Surf? Amazing.  Is Dan Brown ever going to leave the NY Times Best Seller List?    Question of the Day   Is this approach of "Edwards was Kerry's 2nd choice, and his first choice is aligned with us?" going to work for Bush?
