I don't know how many of you have tried to pump information out of an exhausted 14 year old boy before, but it aint easy.  The team walked off the bus looking like zombies, they had not slept the night before, too much adrenaline I am sure.  On our drive home to his bed, I got a call from a co-worker offering me free Dodger tickets and parking, as I was going to decline because of exhaustion this person ion the back seat woke right up and insisted that we go pick up Melody and go.  Good thing we did because parking was right next to the entrance.  Our seats were irectly behind home plate, and the DOdgers played a great game.  So throughout the night he spit and spouted tiny bits of information about the trip.  I will post those when I am home at a PC and can do so with formatting.
