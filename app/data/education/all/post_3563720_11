This year's NBA Finals is painful to watch at this point. Unless the Lakers become the first team in league history to come back from a 3-1 deficit, a team from one of the most miserable, decayed cities in the nation will gain championship rings.   Another sad note for Los Angeles sports fans: Dodgers lost 4-1 today. Another bad outing for Hideo Nomo. He didn't make it through the fourth inning.
