Troy opened today.  I want to see it today but Gyeh-son really wants me to wait for her.  Bummer, oh well it's not like it's going anywhere fast.   I managed to stay up the better part of the night last night playing computer games with my friend Serd who is in Georgia.  We pretty much kicked some ass.   The Braves had a perfect game pitched against them by Randy Johnson.  So yeah they pretty much suck this season.  I'm not giving up all hope but I'm not holding my breath either. Tomorrow stuff should be final for Gumi James and as we're heading off to Thailand.  I need to go and get some traveler checks and make sure I have everything I need.   I don't think I'll ever sit on the lower level of McDonald's in front of a window again and eat.  I'm not sure Koreans have ever seen a westerner eat McDonalds.  I figured it would be a good place to watch people walk by and carry on their business.  Little did I know it reality it was going to be the other way around.  I had people point, stare, wave and do about everything else you can imagine.  What annoys me is that they probably think I eat it all the time but whatever.  Anyone who lives and or has lived here pretty much knows that Koreans don't know a hole heck of a lot so this explains a lot.  Other then that lunch was great.  I even had a coupon for a free ice cream cone so you know that made me happy.
