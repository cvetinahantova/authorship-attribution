I have been looking through some of the Vodafone propaganda, trying to decide on a keitai (mobile phone).  Some of the features that caught my attention: - Video conferencing functionality - TV tuner - 2 Megapixel camera  Oh so saexay.  Unfortunately, I have to wait until the 16th of August before my Alien Registration Card is available (Vodafone requires this to set up a call plan).
