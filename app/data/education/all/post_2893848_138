What is it about the X-Men that continues to draw  urlLink high-profile talent ?  (Via  urlLink (Bookslut ).    I like Whedon and I like comics, but I'm not sure how the two would mix (no, I haven't read   urlLink Fray   ).  Those of you familiar with the sometimes brilliant, sometimes stupid  urlLink Firefly  perhaps know what I mean: the humor, characters and storylines were all signature Whedon, but something, somehow, was still off.
