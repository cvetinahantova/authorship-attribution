urlLink The ups and downs of a Valentine    My morning was great. I talked to two people I care a lot for, and doing that made me very happy. I was overjoyed, as a matter of fact. Then I went to take a nap, but for the first time in... Hmm, in a long time... Since mid-January, I have to say, I did not sleep well. I kept turning over and over, but there was something nagging in my mind. It was that today, eight weeks ago, I said the final good-bye. On that Saturday I last saw everyone from the pack. I really miss them. I miss the mirth, I miss the company. I'm meeting people here, but it's just not the same. I left part of my heart in Corpus Christi, and as much as I may complain about the city, it was my home for almost four years. Many of my fondest memories are from that time. What got left behind is more than just friends... It's a family.
