So my landlord calls this morning to say that she wants to sell the house.  But she wants to see if I want to buy it first.  OF COURSE I DO!  I am so tired of paying rent it's not even funny.  I'm so excited I could pee.  Then I call my parents to tell them the good news.  What does my dad say?  "No.  You're not doing it."  Hello?  I didn't call to ask your permission, I called to tell you the good news.  Then he starts ranting and raving about how I'm not divorced yet and if I buy the house before I'm divorced Pat will go after it and take half of the house.  I tried reasoning with him and saying that I highly doubted that, that I don't really talk to Pat, and that he doesn't have to know that I was buying it.  Of course, my father didn't want to hear it.  He was screaming over me.  He actually said, "I will not allow you to buy that house before you are divorced."  Oh really, Dad?  You're not going to let me?  I'd like to see you try.  Besides, my divorce hearing is on June 15th.  It's not like everything would happen before then.  Get real.  What gets me is that even though I'll be 25 in July, my parents still insist on pulling this garbage.  I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to ground me one day.  This is why I moved out of the house.  Even though I should be there helping my dad, I know that they would have this unbelievable control over my life.  Nothing I do is good enough for my parents.  I do not do what they want me to do, and they hate it.  They don't seem to want to let me have control over my own life.  Here I am, I graduated from college, I have a good job, I'm doing fine on my own, and yet they still think that I am 15 and I don't have a brain cell in my head worth a damn.  Well, you know what?  I'm still going to do whatever I want to.
