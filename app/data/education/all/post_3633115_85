I try to deny it all I want.  I want to pretent that it isn't true.  How can it possibly be true.  There's nothing there to keep me around.  I really don't think it is any kind of problem that can be solved.  And yet, I continue to feel a desire, a need if you will, to find something to blog about.  I'm not addicted.  I don't care what S says.  I just like having a place to write about anything and knowing that people other than myself and S (and any family members) find me interesting.  If they didn't they wouldn't continue to read me. Right?  So, I'm not addicted, just a rambling pile of skin and bones.  You may now return to your regularly scheduled blogging.
