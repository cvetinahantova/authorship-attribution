The Fourth of July weekend was one to remember.  We headed down to Panama City, Florida to visit my wife’s family and for a bit of rest and relaxation.  Although the drive was a bit tiresome, once we arrived, I just had a great sense of happiness.  I didn’t have any homework due or anything work related to worry about.  It really gave me a sense of freedom.  Although there were no death-match go-cart journeys, we got to spend a lot of time with the nieces.  The kids are growing up so fast.  It is such an amazing thing to watch children that were no larger than small melons, grow to walking and talking little people.  Sometimes they are a bit too talkative, but that is the fun about hanging out with children.  On the Fourth, we spent our time on the beachfront, listening to wonderful live music and watching a great fireworks display.  For some reason things that go boom really grab my attention.  I don’t think I will ever outgrow some of my childhood memories.  I played with all the kids, I think there were five in total, and most of them wanted to be on my shoulders, all at the same time mind you.  The days went by fast, too fast, but fond memories were made.  I can’t wait until we can do it again.  Why do all the enjoyable moments seem to speed by, while the daily routines such as work and school, trudge on.  I know it’s simply mental, but it makes me look forward to those days when I can once again smile and warm my body in the sunny beaches of Florida.
