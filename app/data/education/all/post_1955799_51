Hello,  been busy, and I wanteded to write something.  I'm bored with television on my day off.  I am going to be up to my neck in projects.  I was a creative whirlwind last night.  I was up until 2:00 Am writng down Ideas.  I may start writing again.  I have so many ideas.    I'm being distracted by family members.  I won't get anything done.  :-(
