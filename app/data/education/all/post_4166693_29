I'm not quite sure if I'm going to be keeping with this blog or not. Ideally, I just want to have it so that I can comment on all of your blogs without having to hit anonymous and add length to my post by signing my name. It's just a hassle. Although, my livejournal doesn't get read that often, so I might just connect my posts or consolidate down to one.  I'm not sure.  I should probably figure that out.  I'm avoiding packing. Let's be honest. I just don't want to pack anything else. And the big packing issue at the moment is that I need to pack my shoes. Ugh. Too many. Too much work. I want to sleep or watch TV. I'm a lazy ass.  I hope everyone is having a good weekend. Especially, two people that I know (or know of).  Okay, enough of this. I'm off to pack.
