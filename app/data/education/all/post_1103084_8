........................................... what makes for a good post? ...........................................  Y'all are pulling out some interesting entries!  Good job...  Here are some emergent formulas that are working well for your peers if you're interested...  I like the idea of  urlLink Rant ing.  It's a favorite pastime in the Blogasphere.  Here's another  urlLink rant  -- this time focusing on the janet jackson / superbowl debacle...such rants are welcome as long as you do connect them to class ideas (which Ben does do here)  The  urlLink careful articulation of a show's formula for success  is a good way to talk about all the dimensions of media literacy at one time...  Talking about a new media  urlLink phenomenon  is great when it allows you to make connections to the media industry in general *&* to our class concepts (which Trena does both of in this blog).  Combining a  urlLink summary  with a rant is another nice way to use your blog-voice...   urlLink talking through your notes  is a great idea to clarify issues and raise questions -- this would be a good blog for others to respond to...and I'll point out, too, MacKenzie, that another question that appeared for me after I read your blog is (while I know the answer, I'm interested in how y'all (not just MacKenzie) might answer...) If Discursive Formations have to be formed in relationships -- once a GROUP decides on a meaning that they will share -- how can individuals have unique perceptions of discursive formations (unique from everyone else)?  Very provocative.  Though they don't *have* to be this thorough,  urlLink applications of concepts  from the readings -- to real life -- are great blogs!
