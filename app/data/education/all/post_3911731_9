today was as fun at the previous days. Today was actually pretty dumb and a waste of time. I woke up at 7:30 to go to some "huge flea market" in lancaster. My dad told me its bigger then silver springs flea market and its alot of stuff to buy and some food vendors. Well we get there after an hour long drive on the interstate and it turns out its like 99.98% food vendors and like .02% cool stuff to buy. I ended up leaving with 7 movies that i bought, they were all horror movies since that is what I collect and I got them all at one vendor. So i took an hour long drive to buy something for one person. After we leave this fleamarket we took like a 534698736478 hours drive through the country. My parents are all about doing that gay crap like driving around for no reason and looking for deer. I'll tell ya what, ive never wasted more time in my life or been more bored. We left the flea market around 10, and i got home around 3, thats how long of a drive we took. Unbeleivable. I came home and talked to janelle for like 3 seconds then i had to go to a firefighting class. That was from 6-10. That was a waste of time to. I got home at 10:22 and janelle called at like 10:35. I was planning on doing something with her tomorrow since its the last day i can see her until friday (its only one day in between that we can't see each other, but its along time to wait) and it turns out her unknown cousin kelsi ness slept over. Have alot fun with that one. So im gonna go to football tomorrow and then sit around all day. Should be good. Update on my life tomorrow night. PEACE
