Greetings in the name of Jesus!  i have moved to  , Champaign, IL 61820. it is also known as John Randolph Atrium, or stricty ATRIUM, though there is another Atrium on Lincoln, across from UnicoRn.   i have taken over Dean's (aka Ding Ou) room. the apt is kinda dirty, but i'll work on that, starting with my bathroom. my roommates this summer are Jonathan Choe, who Justin and i were supposed to live with originally, Matt and Estin. i'm excited to have the chance to live with Jon before he leaves campus. we are gonna have tons of fun.   the first full day here we had a huge Dimsum dinner with Catherine Yoon's friend Mo. he's a great cook. we started at 7pm and ate around 12:30am. it was crazy good though. we made a ton of dishes from scratch. it took a long time cuz it was for 8 people. i think dimsum is made to be eaten out, the price to time consumtion we experienced proves this. Pheonix anyone? even better, let's go to HK!  more fun stories later i'm sure...  By His grace and mercy, Gill
