When I worked in NJ, I always started my staff meetings off with a good and bad for the week.  It's something that one of my RD's used to do, and I just liked the way it got the staff to share some things.  Today was one of those days that would have made both at my weekly meeting.  Today's bad:  Around 6:00, my phone rang.  It was Tim, and he asked me if I wanted to go out to dinner with him.  I said sure, and he said that he would be there in five minutes, which struck me as a little weird, since he lives a half hour away.  In any case, we ended up going to Friendly's for dinner, and he told me that his grandfather had died this morning.  I felt so bad.  Tim didn't really seem to be that upset, and he said that he and his grandfather weren't that close, but still... I hate it when there is just nothing to say.    Today's good:  In other news, I got a fantastic check in the mail today from the IRS.  You have to love getting money that you never thought you'd see.  Plus, I managed to get a ton of errands run today, which means that this weekend is going to be a nice, relaxing holiday weekend.  Now I just have to hope that I hear from one of the applications I submitted today...
