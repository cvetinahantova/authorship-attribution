Shaquille O'neil, the former LA Lakers superstar,  urlLink may have to testify against his former teammate Kobe Bryant in his upcoming trial . Apparently Kobe's hands mysteriously found their way up a female's chest while at one of Shaq's parties. Here is the details from the article,   "Bryant allegedly made unwanted advances on a waitress during at a party held at O'Neal's home, it said.  ...  [Sports Illustrated] claimed that Bryant asked [a 22-year old waitress] to step outside and molested her at the party at O'Neal's home in Orlando, Florida in October 2002, eight months before he was accused of raping by a woman in Colorado on June 30."   Maybe the whole trial is not sealed on Kobe's side just yet.
