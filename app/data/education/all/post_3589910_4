urlLink People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA): The animal rights organization   I'm working to go vegetarian.. In a ironic way, I hate vegetables. But then again I don't eat much meat, it's disgusting... Except for the turkey and 2 of dad's recipes with red meat. I'm planning on leaving those too. But one step at a time. I don't even like chicken, I eat it because sometimes there's nothing else for me to eat. Did you know vegetarians often live 6 to 10 years longer than meat eaters? Also, meat is one of the most common causes of cancer, heart attacks and weight problems. Proteins? Almost every single thing I eat have proteins, our problem is actually having too much proteins instead of just the necessary. Plus, poor animals, have you seen how they treat them? It's cruel! Now, I'm just trying to digest that, I might end up actually having nauseas out of meats. I love animals... Well, I don't get along with cows very much, but its still cruel! So yea.  I'm still working on it though. I'm eating meat like 3 times a week on the main dish. But I'm eliminating it little by little. I'm having a hard time with my favorite recipies from dad. He's the best meat cooker I know. But still I must do this, for my body and for those poor animals.
