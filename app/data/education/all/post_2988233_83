You are Psalms.   some people think you never get discouraged, but the fact is, you know where to run.    Your prayers are open and honest because you realize that God already knows your heart, He's just waiting to hear you spill it.  And when you do, what starts out as heavy ends up becoming a song of praise.  you may struggle...and you often do...but each time you grow in your understanding of God's faithfulness.  You're just a song waiting to happen.     You are Psalms.    urlLink   Which book of the Bible are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
