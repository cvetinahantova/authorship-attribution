Hmm... just got back not long ago from MAC at whte sand after studying... well rather more like helping Isa out wit a couple of Maths question. Then I bought this really cool ring, well my bro used to have the same one whch I fell in love with so I decided to get myself one too. Well so after white sands I headed to TM for Long John Silver. Man ya should have seen what we did. We kinda had some uncooked fish and extra fries plus a small cup of Sprite. Isa dumped the whole piece of fish into the sprite and I added in some spices( fries and the little crunchy bits) and he took a photo on it. Man it was sick. But it wasn't the end of it, we even added on some chilli or was it ketchup, man it was disgusting! So we left the place in a secon dor so. Lol. So so I got home, and my bro(Jake) told me some really annoying and mean news, well of course its something against us and yeah, there might be changes on for us then.Can't say anything yet... maybe someday, sometime.Â Hmm... I can't imagine, a new environment with different friends all over again. My social circle seems to be extending all the time... how amazing.. Anyway off to bed I will, so as to ya guys. Peace out ya'll! Pleasant dreams! =)
