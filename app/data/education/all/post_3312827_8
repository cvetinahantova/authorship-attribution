It's 9:00 pm, and I have no plans to go out.  I'm so boring.  There are times when I feel like I have no friends, and then other times I just want to be left alone.  I called Matt to see if he wants to hang out, but he already had plans with his roommate and the boys, so he's going to go out with them.  But he promised me that we would hang out this coming week.  Just to go out once on a Saturday night would be nice.  Too bad Ryan went home this weekend, or I could see what he's up to.  Ok, I'm going to go be boring now.  Maybe I'll have a more cheerful post later.
