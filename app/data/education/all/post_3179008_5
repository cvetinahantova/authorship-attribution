We have this girl at our school who had been in the agency for a couple of years. She and her brother lived on the streets with their dad for a while, around ages 4-9, eating out of dumpsters, etc... One of her self-soothing behaviors is to suck her thumb. She doesn,'t just suck it, but has the whole thumb in her mouth with her lips hugging the side of her hand. At this point, she is now 15 years old.   This particular girl is very interesting and fascinating. She believes that she has the ability to communicate with animals. Not talk to them, but understand what they need and want. She and her brother are very good at making many different animal calls and sounds. She is an avid reader, with an afinity for sci-fi. Go figure!  It is unfortunate that she has returned to us, because she had previously graduated from the program and moved on to foster care. That fell through; go figure, not having been ready to go. So she has needed to come back to us, since the type of services we provide are rare and unique. She probably doesn't really need the level of services we provide, but another educational placement couldn't be found,....or, money was to be gained...Perhaps she is not as "reformed" as I hope she is.  gotta go
