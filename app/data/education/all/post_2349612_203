so the two daves got in around 11:30 last night... i showed them around the apartment (5 minutes), helped them move into my TV room, and then we all got some sleep  left for NYC around 10 this morning, picking up ben on the way to the train station... we got into the city around 11:30... the first part of the day was stuff i've done at least half a dozen times but none of them had... subway to the world trade center site, wandered around there, walked down to wall street (and actually got to go inside trinity church on the corner of wall st. and broadway -- that part was new for me), saw the stock exchange, got accosted by a guy promoting a strip club (that was new... mostly because me with a group of 3 guys and the guy didn't see me when he approached them), starbucks, brooklyn bridge, staten island ferry, and then booked it further north.  then, another first... it was pouring down rain, so we ran down to the UN (which i'd never been to before) and toook the tour of it while the rain poured... our tour was given by a cool kenyan guy named osodo... did you know... the UN buildings are joint territory of the 191 countries of the UN? (so in a twisted way i was in hungary and england and china and the US all at once ;-P) that the UN has its own post office with its own stamps that can only be used from that one post office?  and otehr exciting things... we got to see the security council chamber (the one you usually see in news stuff on TV) and i actually answered a question the tourguide asked us (too bad i never *used* to speak up in class!) =P  it was a quality trip.  after the UN, we walked through rockefeller center, st. patrick's cathedral, and central park before stopping at the NYC hard rock cafe for dinner... we each got drinks in the hurricane glasses that you get to keep -- me, a raspberry margarita =)  it was a party  now, tired and sore, we're all back!  and attacking the city again tomorrow :-P  later dudes! =P
