I managed to get the car serviced tonight. Changed the oil, plugs, filters and rocker cover gasket. It took the best part of an hour and it went quite smoothly. I feel a lot happier now that it's out of the way and I have more of an idea of the state of the engine. The parts cost 33 UKP and Sandra is due to pay for those tomorrow.
