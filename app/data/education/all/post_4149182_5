Man oh man, but allergies REALLY suck. I mean, seriously, come on. I've got a horrible cough, sneezing and sniffling (the headache and plugged ears are gone), and even a slight fever. Its horrible.      Read some more out of  The Rise And Fall Of The Great Powers . Excellent book. It covers pretty much everything from 1500 to 2000 (even if it was written in '87). Combined with  A History Of Warfare , you get an enormous amount of information. It's even helped me to do some more work on Entente, but I still have to figure out the income triggers.  C'est la vie.       Couldn't go to see  West Side Story  today, even if some of my friends are going and someone I know is starring in it. Why? Damn allergies. Or if it's a bug, I'd infect everyone in the Grand Theatre. Oh well.      I've also found alot of good music lately. Helps keep my mind off that certain... person. Even if much of it is sap-tastic music (its still good!), it still helps. Even though Bryan Adams is way too despressing for normal listening.
