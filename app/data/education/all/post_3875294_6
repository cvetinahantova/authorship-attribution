Just your classical Sunday afternoon for the Heizelman's.  Church was uplifting and usual, but I was really tired during the service.  The Sanctuary is always warm, winter or summer.  USually I find churches cold, but not this one.   Be careful of wearing sweaters in the winter!  We got some pictures back today of our trip to the coast.  John cought some really neat views of the sunset!  I think we might blow one or two of them up to frame.  John's outside trying to kill the moss in our grass.  I jsut finished cleaning the bathroom., oh, my favorite job by far. NOT!  We really don't have anything pressing, so we should be able to relax tonight.  Later this week, we'll be busy getting ready for our 1 1/2 week long road trip tp North Dakota.  That's were John's family all lives.  Thsi will be my first venture that far east.  I've been to Co. but not further (at least in the US, I've been to Cancun and Haiti which are farther east - stops at ariports in NY at Florida, but that really doesn't count).  Hmm. I think I'll go sit out on the porch swing.  It's kinda muggy today, so I'll see how long  i last.  Oh, my talk with CHristy last night was a special treat.  She might try to call again befreo we leave for ND, but then after than we probably won't talk again, until they are home on fulough in about two years! Bummer!
