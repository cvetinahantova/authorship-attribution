Eek. Last day of school- ever- tomorrow. Suddenly exams seems so much closer...  This has not been the best week of my life. For a start, it has been full of sentiment: the release of the yearbook (and all the signing it entails) seemed to make it OK for people to burst out crying at any point during the day. Ick. I can't deal with people crying; it freaks me out. If they don't stop very fast, i.e. within 30 seconds, I get irritable. I don't cry myself; it shows weakness on my part and it ruins my face. Also, I've managed to go 7 years without most of the year seeing me cry, so I'm not going to break with tradition. It will be the end of an era though: never again will I get postcards from mum with my lunch, or go to M23 for German only to be told by Mr. Birchall that we're in H02, or have to write a radio script for Word Of Mouth, or go to assembly, or have last minute end-of-term parties in the form room, or fight over the stereo in the common room, or complain about the lack of Galaxy bars in the chocolate machine, or wonder who's free now, or, most scarily of all, have my best friends around me all the time. We've had our ups and downs, our fights, our laughs, our cries, our practical jokes and our piss takes, but Bex, Sel, Laura and I (Debbs joined in year 11) have been a little group since year 7 and when I get to Uni they won't be there anymore. And that makes me sad.  Last day ever. Not gonna cry.  Ceff x
