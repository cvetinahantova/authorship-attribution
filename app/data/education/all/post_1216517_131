This is my dad.  We were hungry after cruising around Kalamazoo so decided to get some food.  It was almost 11 and I kept telling dad that all the fast food places would be closed.  I suggested Applebees or Olive Garden.  Well, he goes to Long John Silvers anyways.  It�s 10:56.  All the workers are leaning against the counter, talking. �We still have 5 minutes,� Dad said. Great.  That�s just what I want, some teenage punk to spit in my food. After much persuasion, I convince him to leave. Then he pulls in to Fazzoli�s.  Same thing.  They�re closing. He gets out, looks in the window, comes back. �We still have 3 minutes.� Again, I convince him to leave. Then he goes to Wendy�s.  They�re open late you know.  Yeah, right.  I give up.  We walk in the door as they are closing. Dad is slow.  He does everything very deliberately and very, well, slow.  I order my Classic Double and he�s still starring at the overhead menu and talking to himself. �Hmm...Taco Salad.  Chicken.  I wonder what...  Hmm...� 3 hours later he order the taco salad.  We got our stuff and he wanted to eat there.  I convinced him to leave because they were closing. As we walked to the van, I said, �Hey, I can drive.  I�m experienced at eating and driving. You can sit and eat your food.� �No. That�s all right,�  he said. Damn. We get in the car and he examines the taco salad. �Hmm.  Where�s the...hmmm.  I thought these came with meat.  Do you know?� �Iduhno.� I had already eaten all my fries. �Hmm...Yeah.  I thought they came with meat.� �You could put the chili on it.� �Hmm...I though they came with meat.� He examined the salad some more, then looked in the bag. �I�m going back in.� Oh no. He left then came back.  It was locked. �I need a fork.� Damn. We drove around to the drive thru. �I wonder what I should do,� he said. �You could just wait in line here.� He parked facing the Wendy�s building, between the two drive-through windows. Then he walked up to one of the windows, leaving the overhead light in the van on.  The effect of this was if I looked up, I was starting right at the employee at window #1.  I look to my right its the guy at window #2 and to my left was a constant rotation of customers ordering.  And of course I was illuminated for the whole world to see. Meanwhile, Dad is still standing next to an SUV, waiting for it to get its order and leave so he can get his fork. He comes back and starts to eat.  With the light on.  Not moving the van.  I can just feel all these people looking at me.  I mean, we are right next to the drive thru.  I tried to look down as much as possible as I finished my burger. But back to my Dad�s eating habits...  Earlier, I said my dad was a slow eater. Yeah. You have no idea. It is commonplace for me to almost be done with my meal as he is taking his first few bites.  This is a man that during the course of a meal must reheat his food at least twice.  I am not kidding. MY food was gone, but the adventure was just beginning.  I don�t know how long it was before we got back on the road, but it was a long time. Yeah.  All in all, It was pretty funny.  But next time, I�m demanding Olive Garden
