The other day I was walking home from school. Nothing cute about that. But the road I take goes by a pond/lake thing by the university fields, and that day there were two families of geese there. It's fenced off, but the mother geese were still mightily angry that someone would have the balls to walk 2 meters from their chicks and were hissing to the left and to the right. And that was the day that I'd left my camera at home. But I'll take it next time - hopefully they're still there and I'll get a good shot.
