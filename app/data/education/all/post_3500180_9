Boredom bites. A lot. And it's bad...-_- I have nothing to do. Well, I  can  start memorize The Star Spangled Banner, and O Canada, but I have the rest of the week to do that, so why bother with it now? Hee, procrastination wins again.. x_x  I'm going to Toronto tomorrow. Partly because my family haven't been to Toronto for quite a while now, must do some Chinatown shopping :D ! Also, my parents' friends (who lives in Toronto) are moving to Alberta soon, so we are visiting them, since we might not be able to see them for a really long time. I am glad we are going, 'cuz then I don't have to stay home and be bored...  I have to stress again how bored I am. iamborediamborediamverybored.. And I also miss... people.... yah, heh....
