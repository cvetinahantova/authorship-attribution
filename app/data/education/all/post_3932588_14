We had a fantastic turn-out for our first group run at Movin' Shoes in Encinitas.   We started with a very informative Shoe Talk by owner of the store Rick.  We had beautiful blue skies, but way too much sunshine and heat by the time we started the run, which made it a challenge for us.  Everyone pushed through though and finished!   This provided an opportunity to improve:  We will adjust the program to run first, then do the Clinics wherever possible.   AWESOME JOB LADIES!  Remember - one Step at a Time!
