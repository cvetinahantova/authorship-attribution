Have I ever been spoiled getting all this time with the cats during the day. Lucy is sitting in my lap right now and I'm coming to realise I'll only have a couple more weeks to bask in their adorable ways before having to leave them for at least a year.  Do you think she knows?     I've also been listening to the song  urlLink Babies  by Pulp a lot lately. Muy depressing.
