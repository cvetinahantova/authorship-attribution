Will keep in mind (in mind!) this  urlLink link  when I draw up course websites this fall. The intro to lit class, especially, since they'll be the ones dealing with all things Matrix. Need to remember to get my hands on some books: interlibrary loans instead of amazon, I think. Though if they turn out to be red-pill popping good, I'll buy, I'll buy. (Is there any way out of the blue?)  Have developed a dramatic crush on Keanu Reeves. I like that he asked the brothers what to read while prepping for the Matrix trilogy and that he confessed to Hume and Nietzsche. He is quiet, chameleon, private. Keep on keeping on, KR. For Keeps.
