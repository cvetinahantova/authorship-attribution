Today was a "low-food" day. It's a habit I really need to kick. I have a very bizarre appetite, which will only allow me to eat certain things at very particular times. On one hand, it keeps me skinny, on the other hand, it means I usually don't have enough energy. I think it's a root-cause of a lot of my other problems (general exhaustion, lack of motivation, etc.) I'm not sure what I should do about it, so if anyone has any suggestions, let me know!
