Was another tough day in the world of alternative education certification. I'm tired all the time, and frankly, three weeks seems like years away at this point.  However, I did get to do my first read-aloud session, and I actually, believe it or not,  sang  in front of my class!We're reading a book about a musician, and there were a few lines from the "Happy" song (you may have heard it on the Clinque commercials..."I want to be happy, but I can't be happy, unless you're ha-ap-py too!") Anyway, for the first time since I started going there, they were all attentive and most were even smiling! I was in such a shock! Looking forward to more "happy" moments!   Bonnie contacted some lawyers regarding everything happening with my mother, and apparently no one she spoke with wants to take the case. So, we're moving on to self-made will and distribution. Grreaaat. That really sucks, but what else can I do?  As for my blast from the past, I got an email today from classmates, and it seems an ex boyfriend from college wants to get in touch. Mmmm, I'm curious, because we really did not end on good terms. If nothing else, it could be really interesting, since I'm so, so over him and everything that happened between us. So, I gave him my email, just to see. Ha!
