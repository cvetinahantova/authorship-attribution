well hello everyone,  i'm down on koh chang (i've been spelling it wrong)  for the next few days.   we got here last night and are going to head back friday.  anyway... vicky  told me that it was a very basic place where we were going to be staying but  not many other details.  i'm o.k with squat toilets and staying without  aircon but i do have a small issue with no where to take a shower.  i  basically have to stand next to a pool or standing water and use a bucket to  rinse myself off.  thankfully some of the other people we came down with,  christian from new zealand and kee from bangkok, were unwilling to live that  way and got a very nice room right up the beach.  THANK GOD! now i can go  and have a proper shower when i need one.  other than that i love the place.  great music, great food, and friendly  people are everywhere.  we are staying in a bungalow right on the ocean.   the mosquito netting keeps us from being eaten alive while the sounds of the  waves crashing against the rocks lulls me to sleep.  i absolutely love it  here.  i might should look into job openings. jk. it's nice for a vacation  but i don't think there is much to do here other than lay on the beach and  eat good food.  vicky has a digital camera so i'll be sending pics when i get back.  this is  a promise.  well gotta run.  hope everyone is enjoying their summer.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Get fast, reliable Internet access with MSN 9 Dial-up Â– now 2 months FREE!   http://join.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/
