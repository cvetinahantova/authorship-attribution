Snowy   So... Yeah. I got up this morning, all freaked out because I had almost overslept a meeting at 8:30. So I leave in a hurry, only to find out that school's closed because of the bad weather. I should have stayed in bed, but nooo, I had to do the responsible thing. Well sod that. So I went back home and got ready to get some rest. At which point I get a really nice phone call. With an even nicer followup online. Hehe. Mwehehe. Anyway, after that I went to do some groceries - and I was thinking of doing the homework I was supposed to have done yesterday, but then the sensible me took over and I decided that since school's out for the day so should I be. So I went to bed and slept. A lot. It's the nicest thing about the cold weather - being able to say "Fuck this, I'm staying in bed".
