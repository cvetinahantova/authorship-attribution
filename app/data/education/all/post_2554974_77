Its funny how 2 people who have been arguing for 1 month be having feelings for each other a month later. Its funny how much e blizzard coldness of cold war can turn into life's most wonderful bliss. Well... i'm here 2 say that these things can come true. It came true in my life. I believe in it. Sometimes, e person dat is suppose 2 be with you can be juz right under ur nose. Its juz a matter of realising it. Juz a matter of accepting it. Juz a matter of seeing it.   My Story   When i first started in Millennia Institute in late March this yr, i met a few good friends who were by me thru thick and thin. I was kinda acting stupid for e first half of the yr as they would say. Always merajuk n stuffs. Well.. there was diz one particular girl in the group that was always nice 2 me and vice versa. But when i started 2 merajuk and stuffs, she would be scolding me and we would be arguing like crazy. I would call her 2 apologise nite after nite but we kept on arguing abd another case. After a while, i started hating her. I despise her. I Loathe her. But during e June break, I was away from dem, from her. I thought about wad happened and reflected on myself. When sch reopened, My friends said that i've changed. Although i din realise it, but i've changed. Well.. The girl was having diz WIP(work in progress) with another guy, but they always seem 2 be encountering problems. Slowly, nite after nite, we talked on e phone abt her problems and my problems and soon, we were kinda ok. Soon after dat, her WIP kinda betrayed her. He was a JERK. TOTAL JERK! But she was ok after a while. Soon after dat, we began getting close. Den.. it struck me... wad are we? I mean.. we were like more den friends.. but wad are we? I den realised dat i liked her. I really liked her. Now.. we are.. haha.. WIP.. and after dat.. mmm.. we'll see how it goes. The girl.. My Girl, Inez... God... i love saying dat.. Inez... haa..  Peace Out!
