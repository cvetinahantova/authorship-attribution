Today was room lottery.  I wasn't looking forward to it.  I mean, who would look forward to sitting at a table for ten and a half hours straight?  But actually, it was a better day than I expected.  I got some work done, I talked to a bunch of different people, and someone even lent us a "Dirty Dancing" DVD to watch while we were sitting there.    Tonight, we got together and took staff pictures.  They turned out pretty well.  (If anyone wants to see how they turned out, e-mail me and I'd be glad to send them to you.)  All in all, it was a fairly good day.  I even managed to get some more boxes packed.  Woohoo.    Tomorrow is the real fun, though.  Between judicial meetings, overnight host meetings, and work study evaluations, I have 11 meetings tomorrow. Although each individual meeting will probably be between ten and thirty minutes, it's still a hell of a lot of stuff to fit into one day.
