urlLink Look Ma, I'm on TV!    Alrighty! Well I'm close to finishing with most of the things that have been keeping me busy, both work and personal stuff-related, and I'm looking forward to some time back online. I also caved in to temptation and purchased myself a copy of  Quicksilver . Curse you,  urlLink Richard ! Curse you and your convincing blog entries! Well, at least I think it my stepbrother may enjoy it too.
