ALL IN GOOD FUN!!!!       Hmmm...April Fools Day in Japan.  I must admit that being in Japan is a lot like being on a rollercoaster.  Tons of ups and downs with now being one of the down times for a lot of Miyagi Jets.  As many were forced to say goodbye to their favorite teachers, some also went on to realize that this is just the beginning of 4 months of goodbyes.  Anyway, Jemma and I decided to have a little April Fools day fun.     Anxiously awaiting Stephanie`s arrival at our local Milky Way (local restaurant with picture menu!), Jemma and I decided we were going to mastermind a little trick since Steph was late arriving.  When Stephanie finally joined us I quickly excused myself to let Jemma initiate our plan.  Well, this past Tuesday I had an enkai which generally means everyone is incredibly drunk.  Jemma told Stephanie not to say anything to me because I was really stressed about it and that Dave had tried to initiate something between us (use your imagination).  I was very impressed when I returned and for 15 minutes Stephanie didn`t say anything or even have a silly smirk like I probably would have.  So finally I had to say something.  I did the whole embarrassed routine and had her believing everything and getting excited about the prospect of my return to Teizan and my first day with Dave since the "incident."  She was saying how excited she was when Jemma and I decided to reveal that in fact we were quite excited because the joke was on her!!!  Mission accomplished!     Having successfully accomplished one april fools joke, the three of us then teamed up and decided to get Dave.  Once again we succeeded.  It is amazing how excited people get at the prospect of some really shocking gossip! Anyway, I must say that having a little childish fun in a seemingly more trying time definitely makes you look toward the lighter side of things.  As Jemma and my other Brit friends would say, we definitely took the piss out of Stephanie and Dave!!!
