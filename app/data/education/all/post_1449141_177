[This stuff gets more surreal every day. Via Sam Smith's Progressive Review.]     A PIPA-Knowledge Networks poll finds that 68% continue to approve of the decision to go to war with Iraq. However, only 50% said that they were somewhat (29%) or very (21%) certain that "when the US government presented the evidence to justify going to war with Iraq, it was. . . not being misleading." Another 5% said they were not very certain. . . Steven Kull, director of PIPA comments, "Enthusiasm about the success of the war may be offset by the failure to find evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction or links to al' Qaeda."  Kull continues, "For some Americans, their desire to support the war may be leading them to screen out information that weapons of mass destruction have not been found." While 59% of those polled correctly said the US has not found Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, 41% said they believed that the US has found such weapons (34%) or were unsure (7%).  While 69% correctly said that Iraq had not used chemical or biological weapons in the war, 31% said they believed Iraq had (22%) or were unsure (9%).  Kull adds, "Given the intensive news coverage and high levels of public attention to the topic, this level of misinformation suggests that some Americans may be avoiding having an experience of cognitive dissonance." ___________________________________ http://mailman.lbo-talk.org/mailman/listinfo/lbo-talk
