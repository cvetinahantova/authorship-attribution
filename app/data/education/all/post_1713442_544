urlLink Improving Civic Education in Schools. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by John J. Patrick.  It demonstrates that civic education in the USA is in need of improvement.  From the ERIC Digest:  Civic education is the teaching of knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed to become a responsible and effective citizen of a representative and constitutional democracy. Since the founding of the United States of America, civic education has been part of the core curriculum of elementary and secondary schools. In recent years, however, leaders in education, government, and the general public have expressed concerns about the quality and outcomes of civic education in American schools (Galston 2001, 218-220). They have called emphatically for renewal and reform of civic education in schools. This Digest discusses (1) the current deficiencies of civic education in schools, (2) research-based recommendations for improving content and pedagogy of civic education, and (3) Internet resources on improving civic education in schools.
