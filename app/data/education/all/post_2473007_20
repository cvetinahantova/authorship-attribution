If God truly sees and cares about our pain and suffering, why does it still exist?  How can a loving God watch and even orchestrate this tragedy in our lives?   A simple yet appropriate example may shed some light on this divine paradox.  Anyone familiar with the board game Monopoly can remember the small orange card stating: "Get Out Of Jail Free".  When a player picks up that card, it is exciting to think that they have the ability to escape jail free of cost; but the only way they can experience the promise and power of the card is to end up in jail.   It is difficult yet true.  Only when we find ourselves in difficulty do we really experience the fullness of God's mercy and goodness.  Jesus Himself stated that the whole needed no doctor; only those who are sick need healing.  So we find that in order for God to be most valuable to us, we must be in a place where He is most needed.  That's why Paul states that "His strength is made perfect" in our weakness; because there is a need and He can fulfill it.     Just as a life jacket in the desert is of little value, so would the greatness and power of God be meaningless had we no need.
