Is my grammar really that bad in my entries?  It probably is.  I think I'll start to proof read them.  On second thought maybe not.  That's what happens I guess when you live abroad too long.  Ok today was a long damn day.  I'm so glad it's over.  I took my roommates last class so I could get off early on Wednesday.  I think I've about had enough of LIKE.  I think it order to be in charge or something at LIKE you have to have no clue what you're doing so you can make decisions based on absolutely nothing at all.  Needless to say I just don't understand some things going on at my school.  I think the mindlessness of the material at LIKE is getting to me.  Really I don't think these kids can learn much of anything no matter how hard we try to teach Open 2 lesson whatever.  The material is just garbage.  No wonder students are dropping left and right.  We have no holiday in Feb.  That sucks.  I need to stop taking the quizzes but with so much time on my hands I just can't help it.         I am the Charmer     Charm is seduction without sex. Charmers are consummate manipulators, masking their cleverness by creating a mood of pleasure and comfort. Their method is simple; they deflect attention from themselves and focus it on their target. They understand your spirit, feel your pain, adapt to your moods. In the presence of a Charmer you feel better about yourself. Learn to cast the Charmer's spell by aiming at people's primary weaknesses: vanity and self-esteem.      Symbol: The Mirror.  Your spirit holds a mirror up to others. When they see you they see themselves: their values, their tastes, even their flaws. Their lifelong love affair with their own image is comfortable and hypnotic; so feed it. No one ever sees what is behind the mirror.          urlLink What Type of Seducer are You?   created by  urlLink    urlLink polite_society
