I thought I knew hot but this is ridiculous!!!  So I grew up in heat and humidity but this stuff is just gross.  By the time I get to school I am hot and sticky and no relief kicks in when you enter the building.  All day long I seem to work in a sweat box with occasional relief when I catch a breeze coming in through an open window.  I just don't get it!  While we have been spared the torrential downpours of the rainy season to some extent, Japan should be well aware of what is necessary to fight this stuff. I can't even begin to imagine what those down south are experiencing.  Basically, in the summer we sweat all day long and in the winter we freeze.  I just learned the other day that Miyagi Prefecture is the coldest place in Japan indoors. Perhaps because north of us people were smart enough to install central heating.  I still most definitely preferred winter.  Oh well...in a couple of weeks I will be on a plane and my friends here in Japan can only hope that my plane flying overhead will generate a nice little breeze!!!
