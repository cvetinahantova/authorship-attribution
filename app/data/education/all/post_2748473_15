I was supposed to ask Katie and Annen about doing something tonight........ if you get this then call me.........pease.  Getting back into the Old Salem business at least for Saturday and then homework. Call if you want to hook it up. Oh, and Mikey lies on his xanga! Bad boy! Don't be scared.   would you stay for one night?  if i didn't come home?  the end of a big fight  doesn't matter anymore  the point in my midlife  situation stands  but hours pass like years  wish you were here  wish you were here  did i open an old wound?  is there something i should know?  if it's all ending so soon  how could i possibly let go?  comes to a head, this is high noon  the finale we have planned  but hours pass like years  i wish you were here  say the words so slow  say it without fear  you won't turn to go  you won't leave me here  the past is all we know  the memories are clear  i wish you were here  if i told you, were you listening?  did you know this from the start?  do the dates match exactly?  your plan when we would part?  if i won't wait for another year  i guess you'll break my heart  it's true  you already knew  so take this as a souvenir  remember me, i'm waiting here  disappointed, hanging on  stayed behind while you moved on  wish you were here  The Get Up Kids rock!
