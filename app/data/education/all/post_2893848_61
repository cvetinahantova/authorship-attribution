Those who rocked it out on the dirt floored wine-cellars of philly have a moral obligation to dish scoop for FatWhiteGeisha.  FatWhiteGeisha demands his scoop.  My own scoop is infinitely boring.  I pruned the cedar hedge at my mom's yesterday and cleaned the shelves in the garage today.  Tomorrow the bathroom gets a whole lot of lysolid loving.  Good god, what a glorious life.  Saturday FatWhiteGeisha flies.  Scoop please.
