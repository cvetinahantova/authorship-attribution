urlLink Bibliographic Instruction  I haven't plugged  urlLink Joeant   in a while.  This is a nice spam free directory of the Web which is built by volunteers.  I am highlighting the Bibliographic Instruction category but most are pretty solid.  I am of course a Joeant editor (Level 22) and am a bit biased but if you have some free time you might want to register as an editor and start adding sites you like.  Other sample categories:   urlLink Education   urlLink Presidents   urlLink Weblogs   urlLink Meta Search Engines   urlLink Personal Homepages
