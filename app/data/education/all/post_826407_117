Bad news first.  The Ecclesall non-political club is going to be sold, sad in itself but this probably also means the end of the Jazz club there.  (I've only been there once so am probably not too qualified to be sad but liked the idea of it and alsways wanted to go more).  but  Very good news.  Sheffield has a new Jazz club on Arundel Street.  Its called  urlLink The One Eleven Club  and opens on Tuesday 13th January.  Don't know as much about Jazz as I like to think I do so the listings don't mean a lot too me except that the fantastic  urlLink Gilad Atzmon  is playing there on February 17th, 18th and 19th (a little consolation to  urlLink Helen  and I for not getting Damien Rice tickets).
