Why is it that we always seem to hurt the ones we love the most? And we start it at such a young age! Gracie, Katie, Joey and Kenny were outside playing with a little girl down the street. The little girl asked GracieFairy "who do you like more, Katie or me?" Of course, Gracie said, "Karen."  "Who do you like more, Moses (Karen's brother) or Joey?"  "Moses."  Who do you like more, Bobby or Daniel (Karen's other demon brother.)"  "Daniel."  To Gracie, she was telling the truth. Daniel, Karen and Moses don't care if she goes in the street, or walks around with her pull-up looking like a thong under her tee shirt. They don't have to share their prized possessions, and they don't tattle when Gracie erupts with a bad word here or there.  To Katie, who is 12 going on 23, Gracie was choosing children over her family. And it hurt.  It made me think about God, and how he must feel when we get involved in things we shouldn't...like hurtful gossip, or fighting to get to the top at work even if it hurts others. He asks us, "Who do you like more? Me, or the world? When I discipline you, do you grumble and snivel, and turn to the things of the world to lick your wounds.  Would that we could all choose the things, the people who love us the most, but it's nice to know that when we miss the mark, He's still there, like Katie, to give us His grace, or a cookie, when we ask.
