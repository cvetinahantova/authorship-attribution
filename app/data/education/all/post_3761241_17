you know, some times, i have my good flights and my bad flights. but then again, upon some planes, i nominate my trips as "worst one yet." presently, the worst flight was from hong kong to fukuoka, the last leg of my whole trip. i was so goddamn tired, so i was sleeping for most of the flight through, until we stopped at taipei to refuel and what not. at first, it was great because the whole plane was pretty much empty, so i was allowed to sit wherever i wanted, except for the business class and first class areas. so here i was, all happy, until we soon hit some massive turbulence. well, it wasn't too bad, but it was all shaky and crap because of this typhoon that was about to hit taipei. so at ths point in time, we had our seatbelts fastened and what not, and i soon find myself in err. i was extremely dehydrated on this particular flight back, and i had drunk massive amounts of water. smart move if you're thirsty, but the dumb part was that i didn't go to the bathroom before the plane took off, and i really, REALLY began to have the urge to go when we were still climbing. so here i am, hoping like hell that i wouldn't wet my pants when finally, i felt that enough was enough and i decided to go. well, a stewardess caught me away from my seat and scolded me, and told me to go back to my seat. moments later, an old fellow, while the stewardess' back is turned, rushes into the bathroom and locks the door. good idea. so i tried this myself after a few minutes, and, just my luck, there was another stewardess who seemed to cover for her. so now i get scolded again.  i was beginning to think about taking desperate measures, when all of a sudden, the shaking stopped. so without thinking, i dashed into the bathroom. just then, the captain switches off the seatbelt sign, and i cursed. just my luck. i was let go right when the turbulence stops.
