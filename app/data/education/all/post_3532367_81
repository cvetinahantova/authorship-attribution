Tonight it was the turn of Rob to have an awards ceremony. He has only just started at his group so he just got a welcome present. The band was really good, they have won loads of competitions this year, so it was nice to see them perform for us. It seems Louise may be able to join, but she needs to go on Monday night to see what instrument she could play - almost thought of joining her - lol.
