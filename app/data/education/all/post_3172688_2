Hey! Would you believe it?!? I'm at HOME, although I'd rather be at school! Here in this tiny 3 bed-room house we have 3 adults, 2 kids, and 5 little children running around. That's a whole lot of people in one place. The only time I have some room to myself is when I am in the bathroom but even then someone kicks me out because they want to use it first. I think its pretty retarded that so many people are crammed into a small space like this. ( I know that there  are  people out there that have more people living under a smaller roof, but I think everyone should  at least  have there own room in a house!) I don't mind all of these people staying with us (were only supposed to have 4 people here *my family and I* but my parents keep letting others come here to live) Its just that when there is so many people here that it is stressing out my parents and the rest of us, then its getting a little out-of-hand. My parents can barely afford this house, let-alone all of the food that we need and other accessories, but now they have to pay for the extra electricity, water, garbage, food, etc, etc... Right now I finally have my room to myself, no kids or anything. I have my door closed so no one will come in. I have a little cup of water and a banana to last me 'till lunch, so I'm good. I think my mom might be out of the shower now, so I'm going to go jump in it. Bye!
