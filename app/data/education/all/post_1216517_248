Hello all  It's good to be here.  (Lighting up a Camel and taking a pull of High Life)  I've had a new CD mix on my mind.  It's based on secular artists doing spiritual songs.  This is what I have so far.  1.  I still haven't found what I'm looking for - U2 2.  Given to fly - Pearl Jam 3.  Salvation - the Cranberries 4.  Come on up to the house - Tom Waits 5.  Astral weeks - Van Morrison 6.  Jesus, I/Mary star of the sea - Zwan 7.  Personal Jesus - Depeche Mode 8.  Airline to Heaven - Wilco;Billy Bragg 9.  Turn turn turn - the Byrds 10.  Forever Young - Dylan 11.  Spirit in the Sky - Norman Greenbaum  I know there has to be more songs out there.  Let's hear some suggestions.
