there are times that I get trapped in a moment the way light plays on the water the dance of whispery winds the background noise and the activity of nature beckons me on to be a part of the wider scene and I experience this  through the mind of a child  were it easy to deflate the importance and set down the weight of the world I would find fields of laughter to lie in and trees to climb in abandon time would cease its stranglehold and responsibilities would turn  into blowing bubbles riding the winds of carefree afternoons I would chase them down to the ends of the earth and learn to love again through the mind of a child  I watch parents destroy this gift making elastic minds into concrete to match the nature around them the children have haunted eyes and attention deficit disorders because they are plugged so securely  into electricity and nourished on brand name  cacophonies within this external nightmare there remains an innocent child waiting for someone to wake up and remind them of what is real  can you bring it back to summer with lazy days playing in the yard when we didn't have to grow up so fast or deal with adult concerns take the time to see them and take the time to hear them and lose yourself in the wonder of the mind of a child   Â©2003 DC Vision
