Alright,  urlLink this is just hilarious .  The weather report says that it's going to rain. Or snow. And it's nearly May. Fucking April weather.  Well, it looks like I may become the CSGSA (Computer Science Graduate Students Association) president. Mind you, that's a  may . But apparently they're desperate for one, so I get a good chance at it. And it comes with a nice paycheck too! I worked a bit more with my software, mainly some color spike/decay alterations, so that the brightness/contrast can be adjusted better. Anyway, that has left me mentally drained, so I'll better take a nap before I become  urlLink dangerous to society .
