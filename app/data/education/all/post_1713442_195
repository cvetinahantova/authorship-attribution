urlLink Yeandi Web Directory  This is a cute little directory.  It actually is rather decent...  From the site:   The Yeandi Directory   The name is derived from the phrase "yet another directory".    Submitting Sites   To submit a site you need to browse to the appropriate category and click the add site link in the top right of the site listing pane.   Not all sites get listed, it's a family friendly directory, aiming to list useful sites - there's no need to submit multiple times - and, unless the site is exceptionally large, it will only be sited in one category.    Category Suggestions   Feel free to make suggestions for further categories - you can email info@yeandi.com.
