Coming to the end of the long weekend... It was a good break for me,getting away from school and spending some time with Eileen and of course,with God. Managed to catch the fireworks live by going over to Pastor Rupert's place...It was really great to watch it together with Eileen. Once again, I really want to thank God for her. I went to the Nation-wide Pastors' Prayer Meeting on National Day morning. We delicate and declare that Singapore belongs to God. It was realy great!!! Really believing for revival to come to Singapore and that the Promise of God to Singapore will be stopped by the enemy. We went to different places of Singapore to pray over the areas. Well, came into church for the whole day today, hoping to paint the visitors' lounge but there was not enough paint to do up the whole room.hai...but went out with the staff to Ikea for lunch and do some shopping...oh..and I got back my ring after I changed the size. I praise God that I paid a good price for it and the service was really good...Amen! I'm getting ready for school again tomorrow..but I getting ready for my convocation this Friday. Another holiday for me...haha...Can't wait to see the kids again tomorrow...
