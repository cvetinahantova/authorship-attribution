Odds refer to a ratio of probabilities, while odds ratios refer to ratios of odds. Anyway, they aren't too hard to understand. Here's the example from Pampel:  In 1994, 29.5% of men and 13.1% of women reported ownership of guns. The odds of gun owership for men equal .295/(1-.295)=.418 which indicates that around 4 men own a gun for 10 who do not.  The odds of gun ownership for women = .151 which is (.131/.869) which indicates that about 1.5 women own a gun for 10 who do not.  The ratio of odds of men to women equal .418/.151 or 2.77 which means that the odds of gun ownership are nearly three times higher for men than for women.  In logistic regression, the dependent variable is ln(odds). Of course, we're predicting internet adoption rather than gun ownership!
