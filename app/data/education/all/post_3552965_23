I know I haven't updated this for ages but I do have a pretty good excuse.  As from this Monday I now live in North West London and earn my keep teaching at a smallish language school in Hampstead.  Hampstead is beautiful - I'm trying to focus on this fact as it helps to make up for the pathetic pay - and as the more cultured among you probably already know, Freud had a house here.   I was offered the job last week while staying with Rose (a direct result of the cold-calling I mentioned) and although the money is not really what I hoped for I feel that after two months of sitting around I think I'm better off working and being independent rather than just arsing about at home.   The school is fine, none of the students are truly satantic (although there are a few Frogs - don't worry, I'll be keeping a close eye on them) and it will do nicely until I can find something better.   I have an interview tomorrow for the same kind of job I went for in the Guardian around a month ago and threw a tantrum about not getting (teaching asylum seekers ESOL and 'basic skills' i.e literacy and numeracy) so cross your fingers for me.   My main worry is that the salary is pretty poor (Â£12 - 16 k) and I'm a crap negociator but I'll just have to tear off a page from my canny little sister's book I suppose.  Remember, I'm passionate about MONEY not MOBILES!!!!  No, wait, I mean, I have fabulous interpersonal skills, endless patience and think I could educate illiterate Somali women who've been raped and tortured...  Please give me the job - and a living wage...  Right, must go and plan tomorrow's classes (the joys of relative clauses) and pick up my interview suit from the dry cleaners.   My next entry will be less brief and filled with my personal ruminations on life, the universe and everything for those of you who think you can stomach it.
