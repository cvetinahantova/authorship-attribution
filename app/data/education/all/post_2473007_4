The room is dark and my soul is alone;     Sharply cut by the blades of the whirring fan. I have lived many lives, and have died many deaths;     Now I lie like a broken crayon.   At once I filled many pictures with hue     Empty pages that once drew a colorless stare But the strokes that I made and the depth that I gave     Lie silent in numb disrepair.   My tears rum warm and my blood runs cold     As my mind lingers back - an expressionless face Has the life that I shared and the color I drew     Vainly tinged an unfillable space?   The room is dark and my soul is alone;     Sharply cut by the blades of the whirring fan. I have lived many lives, and have died many deaths;     Now I lie like a broken crayon.
