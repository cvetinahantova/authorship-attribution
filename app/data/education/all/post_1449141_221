Imperialism Now! continued   The danger of the Cabal theory is that we focus too much on bush and his neocons and we lose site of the whole sea of elites who support the overall mission of US domination of the Globe.  We may defeat Bush in 2004, but we whoever we elect will most likely have people around him that have similar views.  Maybe not the steel booted imperialism of Paul Wolfowitz, but the velvet glove imperialism of Clinton.  With this knowledge we must be clear about what an anti imperilsim is for as much as what we are against.  What we are against is not just a few elites (cabal of neocons), but a system of global control by a few corporations and their major benefactor state the US and a few other capitalist states in supporting roles: Japan, Europe, China, Russia and a few other east asian countries.
