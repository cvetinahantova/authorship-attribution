urlLink NEWS of the WEIRD  As this site proclaims, "Proof that true stories are weirder than made-up stories."  This is a interesting site with a large number of funny (and sometimes disturbing) stories.  I think this would make for a good information literacy assignment.  How about we have students try to find out if the stories are true?  With a little digging, and the help of Lexis-Nexis, it should be possible to track down all the events being described.  I noticed that generic web searches for the news described brings up a lot of hits to newspapers who carry the weekly News of the Weird columns.  It could be a challenging assignment that teaches how hard it is to verify claims on the Internet.
