Ok, do all of you people who vote for Jasmine have sotton in your ears or something?  The girl can not sing.  Yes, she has a pleasant enough voice, but how, please tell me how, do you vote for her over Fantasia and Latoya????????  Latoya should have won, hands down, plain and simple, she IS the American Idol.  And you know what, when all this is over, she will be like Clay Aiken and will do much much better that the actual winner.    If Jasmine doesn't get kicked off next week, I am done, I won't watch AI again.  She doesn't deserve to be in the top 3, she shouldn't have been in the top 4, but that was ruined when Jennifer Hudson was voted off.    I can't believe it.
