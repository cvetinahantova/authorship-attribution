I was listening to Howard Stern this morning during his press conference.  He is going back on the air in all 6 markets where he was fired by Clear Channel, and he's also adding three new markets, mainly in swing states.   Between Howard and Michael Moore, there are certainly lots of supporters way out there for the Democrats this year.  This is a direct result of George Bush being a divider, and not a uniter, despite his election year promises.
