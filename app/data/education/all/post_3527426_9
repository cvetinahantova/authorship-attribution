Well, I've been meaning to set up a blog for sometime now...I'll randomly get the urge to write something down and share the world, but then I've never found one I really liked before. I visited a guy's site here ( http://transplantedtexan.blogspot.com/ ) , and decided I liked it. So, here goes!  This blog will probably be probably mostly scattered thoughts on my part (as indicated by the title!) and perhaps (if I ever figure out how) I'll let others join in on it as well :)
