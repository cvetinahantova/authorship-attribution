Ok...  I've been fooling around with our blog and have done some html coding to make our comment areas easier to read and deal with.  I've transferred old comments to the new places and some that were too big, i made them their own post.  Hint...sometime when you click on the new comment link, it's lazy...so refresh your webpage and try again kids...it will work.  Any comments on the newest change...i'm learning all kinds of neat things that we can do to our new blog home.  Suggestions are welcome...I AM THE DIRECTOR!
