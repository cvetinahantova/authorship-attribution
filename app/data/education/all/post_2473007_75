It seems like this week more than any in a long while I have been inundated with people who say one thing and live another.  I have students who say they believe in and worship God but give no visible indication to the reality of those claims.  I hear people speak their religion as if it were a popular sitcom... have to tune in each week to see what happens next, even though in all reality it could go away and life would continue.  People are satisfied with a disposable faith because it is SAFE.  If someone begins to question, the casual believer can step back into the shadows and easily sever all ties with God, appearing normal and nonthreatening.  To truly taste of His goodness, we must step forward into the danger zone and appear fanatical and (heaven forbid) trusting.  What person finds a cure for cancer and quietly pours it out into the dirt?  Anything important in life is worth getting excited about, and anything worth getting excited about will require either supreme effort or supreme grace.  Interestingly enough, we have been given a taste of both.
