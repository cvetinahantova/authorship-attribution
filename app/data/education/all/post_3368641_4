the world crashes in the lines blur and I am riding an updraft of distraction  the window is opened and I am flying I am out of the zone I am a dim bulb with no focus no magic no moment to savor  lost again in a fast forward world rewinding and rehashing the same shit over and over till it fills up your head and haunts every tick of the clock   and I fight the undertow in my thirst for silence   Â©2002 DC Vision
