We make God very small when we indulge in our selfish pride.  When our desires and our agendas outweigh godly choices, we belittle Divinity to the point of erecting ourselves as the golden calf.  Self becomes god.  Humanity knows better than Divinity.  Why would the created push the Creator into obscurity?  Would we truly consider ourselves as the omniscient authority if we captured but a glimpse of Heaven?  Perhaps we grow haughty because of God's silence.  Nature screams His existence, but in a world of urban wonders the nonexistant stars are deathly silent.  Those lights that do shine are powered by a Divine nature that has been delegated into the hands of a beurocratic mankind and the person of God is reduced to dark suits and conference tables.
