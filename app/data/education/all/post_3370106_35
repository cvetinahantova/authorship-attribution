Even my mistakes I will give to God.  Everything I do is only through God.  Only through devotion will I find my way down the path toward enlightenment, toward freedom.  It is my true desire to learn to live each day in a way that honors all my commitments starting first with my commitment to walking a spiritual path.  I offer no resistance to this, but I must learn to accept the joy, love and freedom that my soul so desires, yet I still cling to my chains.
