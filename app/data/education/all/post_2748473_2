Snow! Yay! No school today or tomorrow. I finally get a break from things for a wee bit.    I hope I am not going around in circles and I wish that this was a dream sometimes, but I must go on with the show. I am not gonna post anything else until I get some things straightened out in my life. So I love all of you guys and take care.  Don't waste life.
