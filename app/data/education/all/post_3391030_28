Do you ever just sit and think? Think so much that you think yourself into a mess of some sort? I do... a lil to often... What if...? that seems to be the most popular question... These are the times that i wish i couldn't think cuz i just like drive myself mad with it! hrmm and it's about so many different things... and stuff that's pointless but yet i let myself worry about them or get to me... sheesh i dunno i guess i just have problems.... lalalalalalala i dunno i feel like writtin like something deep but i never can! it sucks butt! i think it's so awesome to read stuff from someone who's like a "deep" person but then of course half of the time i don't always understand but ya i'm just not a deep person i'm more of a Blah person ya know? more borin sheesh.... maybe that's why i've never had a bf cuz i'm just not interestin.... or maybe argh nvm not gonna go into that... It doesn't really bother me most of the times but then it's like ARGH when everyone around you can talk about it but you can't. oh well i'm just different! what's new? lol oh ya i know something else i wanted to write about! Ya i've got alot of stuff from my friends about my dad... like they think he's mean or something because he has this look on his face... true sometimes it does look like he's mad but that's just his facial expression... in someways i dunno it kinda erks me when peeps say stuff like that bout him but then i know they don't know him as well as i do... but then they act like they are afraid of him and he's never done anything to him but ya... so if you are readin this and you think that my dad is like always mad or anything like that just know that he's not because if he was mad you would know... but ya i guess that's all i'm gonna right about for now! ttyl!
