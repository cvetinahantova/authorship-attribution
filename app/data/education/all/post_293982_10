I had dreams about catalogues for black preachers last night.  Catalogues that apparently listed our SAT classes without any hint of location.   And then my backup 6:40 alarm went off and I cant go back to sleep.  So I'm posting to tire myself out.  I really do throw myself into my job.  How many other people would be reading a message board about the new SAT before 7am?  or checking their work emails before then, either.   My old boss STILL hasn't announced that i've switched jobs, even though he promised to do it multiple days ago.
