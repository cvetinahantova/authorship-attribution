So I was cleaning up my room, separating the wanteds from the unwanteds and came upon an interesting essay I wrote in my English class sophomore year. Though, I don't know if it really makes any sense. The only simple explanation I can give is that I probably wrote it  really  late the night before it was due. Anyway.. there ya have it:   Every day I pass by clusters of people composed of those who generally share the same interests and views. I then see the few strays that flourish far from what is typically "general." Yet I can relate to those social outcast for it almost seems as if my views had been rejected, this I am labeled as a pariah. As I began to walk by the "high maintenance" cliques, there was a "crackling quiet that in itself was an accusation." Lately, I began to realize how I am closely compared to the character of Leonard Mead, in Ray Bradbury's short story  The Pedestrian.  What I can infer about this is that the people that are usually excluded from groups are the ones whose open-mindedness and dynamic views are seen as out of the norm perceptions.
