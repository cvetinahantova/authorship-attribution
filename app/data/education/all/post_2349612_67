it's a good day when what i'm up to has no relation on the world, and then i remember what's going on in life.  my friend jenny just got sent back to the states from haiti where she's been a peace corp volunteer for the better part of 2 years.  she was due to come back later this year anyhow, but now we all get updates about the looting, her friends still caught in the chaos there.  what makes me lucky that i live in a relatively safe country?  people complain when bad stuff happens near them, but truth is something really bad is happening somewhere at any given point in time.  you're lucky when you're safe and all your friends are.  mostly i'm just sad for what's going on there right now, having several friends who have good friends there, etc.  mostly i guess i'm just sad for the world.  it's funny how the calendar can play into your emotions.  nicole died exactly 6 months ago this coming friday.  in theory, that shouldn't make my feelings about the situation change any more from one day to another than usual over the past half a year, but somehow anniversaries of events are significant.  kristin (roooommate) is visiting me this weekend, and we were chatting on IM earlier.  she suggested (and i agreed) that since we'll both be in the same place friday, we should call nicole's parents together to let them know we're thinking of them and just chat a little.  it's a good idea and i'll do it, but i'm already bracing myself emotionally.... it will already be an emotional chat, and probably a kinda tough one to get through... it's going to be a weird week.  i'm done being all morose, i'm going to sleep.  night.
