Ok if I wrote Webster's Dictionary (which I obviously don't b/c my name isn't Webster) and I was going to define inefficient I would put a picture of the Hue station and all the employees that worked there.  For those of you who live or lived in Korea you understand how chaotic it can be to wait in line.  Man this was like a demolition derby with people just piling around two windows trying to get tickets.  What I couldn't figure out is how the hell nothing ever seemed to get accomplished.  Really.  Nobody ever seemed to get tickets or answers or anything.  People just kept yelling and waving money, id's or whatever else they had.  After what seemed like forever I finally go helped after the guy who was waiting on me got fed up of waiting and started barking at them.  So to make a long story short I did get the train ticket I needed.   I leave at 6:45 tomorrow so I'll have most of the day to chill out.  I saw everything I had to see today.  I was going to take a tour of the DMZ (or where it used to be) but if I do that I'll be cutting it a little close.  I'm not really that pumped about it so I'll let it pass.  I've got to get some sleep.
