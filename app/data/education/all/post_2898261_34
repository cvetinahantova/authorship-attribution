Listening to: silence Mood: not sure    Sorry, but yesterday was a one-off! My Portuguese is not up to being tested to the limits when expressing my feelings! (You don’t want to know how long it took me to write something so short!!) Maybe a course in written Portuguese is in order…   Anyway, a new day has started (albeit quite some time ago!) and it’s time to shrug off all the negative feelings and thoughts from the past few weeks, it’s time to look to the future with a positive outlook and embrace whatever life gives us with a smile.  Enough of paying attention to the insignificant! Enough of wasting time with the ignorant! Enough of worrying over possibilities!   Now is the time to grip what we know we have; To focus on the imperative; To take pleasure in moments taking place now; And to surrender to our emotions.
