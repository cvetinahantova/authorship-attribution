.:Rockin' the speakers to:  Love Song  by The Cure    I truly do not understand the purpose of my being here. I just sit in front of this computer all day and type away about meaningless things; and it's not like I'm being paid to be here either. The only reason I can understand why I'm here is because of this: For the past 5 years, I see my parents 6 minutes a day --sometimes even 45 (if you count an evening of dinner or lunch). So being here allows me to spend more "quality" time with them. Personally, I don't see the difference.  I wish there was something more that I can do instead of wasting the day away in this cubic hell hole. I  could  get a job, but my parents won't let me work. Yet it's ironic how they'd rather I work for them. To me, that's just grabbing more cash flow than I already ask for in their very own wallet. Besides, I'm not even the slightest bit interested in the Mortgage business. I have this scary feeling like I'm going to have a sudden outburst, and throw out a humongous rage. I'm suprised how well I'm taking all this in; though, you don't want to be too quiet or you'll end up shooting every one that's in the vicinity. Frightening isn't it?
