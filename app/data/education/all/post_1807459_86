Too tired to blog.  I was going too but I've managed to mess the screen up and I think I'm going to pass out.  Stuff is good but busy.  I'm really enjoying life right now.  I got my time off but I still need someone to roll to Taiwan with.  I hope this comes through.  Somebody says Cambodian chicks are hot.  That is good to hear.  I'm looking forward to meeting some.  LIKE meeting this week, yuck.  I like o-deng, maybe just a little too much.  To hell with spell check.
