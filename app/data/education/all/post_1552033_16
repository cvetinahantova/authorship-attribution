I am happy to see  urlLink Bracing against the wind  back online.  That's the weblog for the person who provides the free comment box I'm using.  The system is clean, simple, and most important of all,   free!    It's a bit slow, but that's okay.  For the price, it's a great value!  Once I learn some modern HTML, I can even customize the appearance of the comment system.  Don't hold your breath, though, that may be awhile!  In my neverending search for alternative views, I have stumbled across one of the most interesting adult weblogs I have ever seen:  urlLink Memories of a Sex Kitten .  It's much different than the usual "sex blog" because rather than telling stories, she recounts her feelings about each encounter.  Most of them seem to have been pleasing enough, but she's also honest about her own shortcomings and the times when her partners could have treated her a lot better.  If raw sex offends you it's not a site you should visit, but if you are open to the full range of human experience than her perspective is definitely worth reading.
