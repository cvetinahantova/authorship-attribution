Da Pistons rule    Â  Haha, farewell Kobe and Shaquille! The pistons won! wohoo. Alright alright, I didn't see the game totally, as I was busy working on other stuff (which I really didn't want to do anyways!). But Pistons won! I never really had a liking towards either team, I just wanted someone to beat the Lakers!I long for the days of the Bulls. Stupid Coach Jackson! If he had only not lied and said he was NOT retiring..we'd still have Michael playing for the Bulls! :( I'm stuck on Jordon!
