I must admit that the grass is greener...anywhere outside of Japan.  Over the past two weeks it has become increasingly apparent that this country lacks grass.  For miles and miles one can find nothing but concrete.  Why is this such a problem you ask???  Well, Miyagi Jets are now training on the weekends for the upcoming soccer tournament in Nagano.  Unfortunately, finding a suitable location is nearly impossible.  Basically, there are two places we can rent (yes, we have to pay to play) in our entire prefecture that have any grass. And in fact, one of these fields is not even completely covered in grass.  Last week we were forced to play at a high school and EVERY high school in Miyagi has dirt fields.  This is due to the fact that it is easier and cheaper to maintain, and all sports teams (baseball, soccer...) all practice and play on the same fields.  So, in a country covered in concrete and rice fields, it aint easy finding green.
