So the most important thing that I have learned from working here is how to talk to people and get what I want. I called the Italian Consulate in Dallas and straight away he said that I need to go to Houston. After asking a couple questions, it was understood that bottom line there was no other alternative.  So...okay...  I called him back and told him how far Houston was from OKC and that online it says that if I can't go then I can go to Dallas. So he thought about it for a second and said that I can call him next week to set up an appointment. So I said great. But will that be long enough time for them to process my visa? So after talking a little more he said that I could come down there this Wednesday and he will take care of everything for me.    So after talking a little more on the phone...all is well.    Fantastic!!!
