My mom passed away a few hours ago.  I'm currently waiting for my Aunt Liz to call me back to start the family phone tree, so I decided that while I waited, I would email my Fellowship advisor just to let her know that I wouldn't be at school tomorrow.   We are planning to have a small gathering at the house when I come home in August, and I will be posting more details once they are decided.    Thank you all for your support during this time, you all have definitely been a source of comfort for me.    Unfortunately, now is when the really hard work begins.
