Ok.. here's something useful:  urlLink turux   I don't know who does this site. I don't know what it means. I just know I love it so much. It is to me the first, finest, and only proof of real electronic art. The feeling to me is indescribable. Although of late I have been wandering off the real techno freaking path, I am still a techie. This site helps me jump from thecno to electronica. It's just sublime. I hope someone reads this and agrees with me.
