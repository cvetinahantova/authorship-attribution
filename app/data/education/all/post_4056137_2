I never much took to the diary thing, but we'll try this.   Me, well...there will be plenty of time to get into me, but right now I'm not really the point.  Outside of my idea to make this blog.    Chris Heinz is on TV, introducing his mom.    I realized the other day that I am not even contemplating the remote possibility of four more years of the current administration.  As a rule, I'm not going to ever refer to the assorted collection of excrement that is currently in office in the administrative branch of this government.  They don't get their names into print on my blog.    Teresa Heinz-Kerry just came out to the tune of "Simply the Best" by Tina Turner.  Which I don't really understand at all.  Why do the democrats always have such shitty choices in music for their convention intros?  I mean, the worst thing about Clinton last night was the reprisal of "Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow".    Bill Clinton = The Golden Child.   Fleetwood Mac does not do it for me.  My father, an affirmed former Fleetwood Mac fan, can't even explain it to me, the whole Fleetwood Mac deal.  They are not good in any way that I can hear.   Anyway, I can see how this blog will have it's purposes.  Like I said, there will be more on the way.  You can email me at  urlLink mrkblog@optonline.net  (I'm impressed that that just hyperlinked automatically).  But if you mock, expect to get mocked.  Im'a run this shit like I own it.  If you are cool, and want one, maybe I'll let you post, too.    Now, to catch the rest of the Ketchup baroness of Pennsylvania.
