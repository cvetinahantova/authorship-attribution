The LA Times has an excellent  urlLink electoral vote tracker.   Unlike most, they actually plug in the latest state polling data.  Based on these polls and previous voting history, Bush would carry every state that he won in 2000, except OH and WV.  Kerry would win all of the Gore states except for NM and WI.  NH is tied between the two.  Even without NH, that gives Kerry 270 electoral votes--the minimum necessary to win.
