Me singing???  Well I went to check out service the service at Florence Avenue Foursquare Church today. It was cool. The college group meets in the same room we meet for bible study. Vince was speaking about joy and peace. What was so interesting was that before Vince began to share they youth pastor gave an announcement. He told us today we are going to go early because we "as a group" are going to be the choir and sing for the whole congregation and bless them today. My eyes opened wide and I was like, "Are you serious?" As I thought in my head I was like this is so embarrassing. First, because I don't know how to sing and second, it's my first time here and I am going to be in front of everyone. I was ready to walk out the door. But suddenly everyone was just like its alright, and Vince was like remember we don't get our approval from no one else but God and we have nothing to worry about. Who cares if we are off beat or out of tune. We just have to praise God and delight him in that. So I just hung out with everyone as we walked to the choir room. We got ourselves in three lines and shortly after we walked in to the sanctuary. The place was so big and everyone was looking at us with smiles as they worshiped with us. I was able to block off my feelings and my embarrassment and just worshiped God. It felt good. We then finished and we went into the sanctuary. The message today was on forgiveness.  Eventhough the experience was nerve wrecking God gave me grace to be okay and I really feel God has been working in me to really trust him. He has literaly taking me out of every comfort zone I have created. First going into a new church. Second, meeting new people. And Finally, not being nervous to praise God in front of anyone. Wow! It's been a lot but I am greatful God is so loving and faithful.
