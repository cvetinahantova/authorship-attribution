The ideas pertaining to "freedom" and "indaviduality" have been skewed in this country to an indescribable state. Why do we associate optimal-amount-of-choices with personal freedom.    I was in Albertsons the other day. I was walking past the small Starbucks stand they have so conveniently set up inside the store and I had the most unfortunate opportunity to overhear a woman ordering her "coffee". She ordered her drink as if she was reciting some portion of the declaration of independence, memorized for a fourth grade presentation. "I'll have a double-soy-chai-latte-with extra foam-at 140 degrees." 140 DEGREES!!! How on God's green earth does this woman have any idea at what temperature she preffers her coffee. Maybe she should have been more specific though, you know...she didn't really specify whether that was 140 F or celcius. The Starbucks employee might misunderstand and fix her a grande cup of molten lead.     I guess what I'm getting at is that coffee is coffee is coffee. I'm embarrassed to be a member of a society where these kind of specifics are all too important in the lives of many.    PS- Juan Valdez has been bustin' his hump for generations of content coffee consumers. So, step outside of the tiny bubble you live in... and get on the donkey.
