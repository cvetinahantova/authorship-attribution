"Hi, Mom."  "Hi, honey.  What's wrong?  You don't usually call this late."  Catrina looked over at the clock - 10:41pm.  Her mother was probably in bed by now, but not asleep.    "No, nothing's wrong, I just need something."  Catrina rushed through her words, not wanting to waste any time.  "I left my address book at the house the other day, and I need a number out of it."  "Sure, hon'.  I picked it up the other day as I was cleaning, I put it in my purse so I could give it to you the next time I saw you."  Catrina's mother drowsily spoke these words.  At the same moment, Catrina opened up the underwear drawer of her brureau, looking for just the right pair of panties.  Looking at the clock once more, she decided that time was at a premium, and skipped the undergarments completely.    "Mom, the number I need is under Johnson.  Chris Johnson."  Catrina couldn't help but let a mischevious grin pass her lips.  Pulling a short black skirt over her hips, she could already feel a dull throb between her legs.    "I'm just finding my glasses...  Jacob, Jeffries, ah, Johnson.  It was Chris, you said?"  Catrina began to curse herself for ever letting her address book out of sight.    " Yes , mother."    "It's 839-2755."  Catrina could hear her mother take in a long, deep breath, as if she was about to say something.  "Thanks Mom, got to go, sorry."  Catrina hung up the phone, with only the slightest amount of guilt and finished dressing herself.   She decided on a light, almost sheer, button down shirt.  Her erect nipples, without the trappings of a bra, showed through the shirt, two dark points leading the eye to her rounded, voluptuous breasts.  After pulling on strappy sandals, with a slight heel, she grabbed her bag and headed down the staircase and out the door.     ***************************************************************   Sitting in the dark cab, Catrina began dialing the number her mother had given her.  She could see that the cab driver was looking at her lasciviously.  She met his eyes in the rearview window, and uncrossed her legs, teasing the driver with bare skin, and a few light, curly hairs protuding from the darkness.    "Maybe you should watch the road."  Catrina said, with a smile.  The driver obeyed.  A voice on the other line answered.  "Hello?"  "Chris, it's Catrina."  Catrina said with a warmth in her voice.    "Hey, Catrina!  It's so great to hear from you, babe.  What's up?"  Chris had a smoothness to his otherwise masculine voice.  Catrina noticed goose bumps on her arms.    "I need to see you."  Catrina felt like she was the top of a roller coaster, full of anticipation and determination.  "I need to see you, now."    She could hear Chris quietly laughing on the other end of the line.  She could also hear other voices.  She feared rejection, but was confident that she would get what she needed tonight.  "How does 10 minutes sound?" said Chris.  She knew that she held a special position in Chris' agenda.  She knew she had power.  Control.  "I'm on my way."    ***************************************************************   As the cab pulled away from the large condominium complex, Catrina hesitated momentarily.  This was not the first time she had been here, but it was the first time she had been here for selfish reasons.    She remembered her first time in the elevator, with Dex, making their way up to the penthouse. Chris' penthouse.  Chris was a successful architect by day.  He, in fact, designed the condo he was currently living in.  By night, however, Chris was a master of ceremonies, of sorts.  Chris held monthly parties for the young, the open minded, and, well, the horny.  Chris was Bacchus reincarnate.  These parties, which were of course through invitation only, featured the finest wines and most delectable food.    Then there was the sex.  The parties were not orgies.  Chris felt that orgies were too primal; too  bourgeoisie .  Instead, he provided comfortable, private (or semi-private) spaces for those interested in intimate companionship.  Some were there to make love with their wives or husbands. Some were there to fuck a stranger.  Some were there to fondle themselves as part of an audience; or for an audience.    Dex and Catrina knew what they getting themselves into.  At least, they thought they did.  Dex had met Chris through a shared acquaintance.  After several meetings, Chris invited Dex to one of his gatherings.    Dex mentioned this to Catrina.  She struggled to contain her enthusiasm.  Dex and Catrina had been dating for over 2 years, off and on, and she was excited to try something new.  Though she and Dex had a very active sex life, she felt they had both fallen into a routine.    So, wearing their most revealing and tight clothing, they set off for the penthouse.  The elevator doors opened, revealing a somewhat subdued gathering of Chris' guests.  A few people, both men and women, were standing about drinking wine, smoking cigars, or sampling the various platters food.  A few more people were lounging on couches and chairs.  Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue" could be faintly heard weaving throughout the large, open penthouse.    "Dex!  Hey! Welcome!".  Chris came bouncing over to where they were standing.  His white, though slightly crooked teeth shone in the dim lighting.  He was, Catrina noted immediately, tall, dark, and handsome.  Like her, he had large, deep brown eyes.  His lips were full, with just a hint of facial hair on his chin.  Catrina was attracted to him immediately.
