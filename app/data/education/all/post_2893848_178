Double Lunch   Too busy for "Man-movies"?  Not in this house.  Never.  I have not, however, seen any lately.    But I have started watching  urlLink Freaks and Geeks  on DVD.  It's been said before, it will be said again, but high school sure did suck.  Particularly, this show makes me realize that at the time I had no idea that it sucked as bad as it did.  There was nothing to compare it to, I guess, and no concrete reason to expect that life would get better.  It was almost like I knew I would either acclimate to suffering for have my proverbial  urlLink liver eaten daily by a hawk .  (The Teenager as stoic?  That's fucked.  I can't possibly mean that, not really.  But  something  is keeping these kids from suicide.)  But even if half the equation is getting better at life, the other half is not being terrorized, daily, by sundry assholes.  There are assholes in adult life too, of course.  But something about them seems easier to deal with.  Their behavior is more predictable, for one.  And they tend not to punch.     Yeah.  I'm sleepy with work done so I'll stop there before this gets too incoherent.  Thanks for posting again, Drew.  It's about time I had some virtual company around virtual here.
