So here we are Rachelle and I trying to stay awake after nigh on thirty six hours of sleep deprivation, just so we may fool our body clocks in to thinking that twelve o'clock Midnight is actually Lunch time and vice-versa. Everything is getting weirder by the minute and the thought of being on the other side of he world from where you were only 24 hours ago - is not helping, but we only have three more hours to go before we will allow ourselves the blissful, beautiful dreamy, warm, comfortable a much anticipated joy of a good nights sleep. Wish us luck
