I'm faced with a tough decision this evening.  On ESPN, the second installment of "The 2004 World Series of Poker" is being aired.  At the same time, Major League Baseball's All-Star Game is being aired (the Cubs have 3 reps...Double S, Big Z n MO!!).  Now usually it'd be an easy solution - tape one.  Unfortunately the only VCR I can use to tape stuff isn't operating correctly.  So I'm forced to decide.  Which one, poker which I'm like obsessed with, or MLB's best game of the year until October.  This is rough.
