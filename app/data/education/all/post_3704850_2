Hey guys.  Just wanted to let you know that we're working to schedule a meeting/conference call for some time on Tuesday, June 29 to talk with Dan Benjamin.  He is going to show us some of the detials of the content management system and walk us through a training session of how to use it.  The most likely time for this meeting is  10:00 AM , so please plan on this tentatively.  I'll let you know for sure once the time is confirmed.  We'll meet in our basement area and have a speakerphone and a projector so that we can all see the same screen.  See you all on Monday.
