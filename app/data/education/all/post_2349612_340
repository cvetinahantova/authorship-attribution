... or international space station in the sky with jupiter... same difference, right?  ok, not really the same, but i did indeed see the space station tonight!  it made a big arc to the west for a little under 10 minutes around 9:30 tonight... it was on the news earlier, and i got to a good break point with data entry for work about 10 minutes before it rose, so i made a point of going outside to see! :-)  other exciting events of the day?  after church and lunch today, the family went to the wonders exhibit downtown (see  www.wonders.org )... wonders exhibits are travelling museum exhibits that hit memphis for 6 months at a time... they generally get one per year... this year was the history and estate of the medici family of italy... pretty cool... my favorites were a case of math tools, and a case of astronomy tools the belonged to galileo.... of interest to my fellow lutherans, pope leo, who excommunicated luther was a medici so i got to see the papal bull that actually did that... also of interest to valpo CC people, i got to actually see part of a fresco painted by giotto, since he was from the time and place of the orginal family line of medicis and they sponsored his students some too... in summary, it was a cool exhibit!  so yeah, then the space station, and a good chat with roommate, and lots of data entry... and more data entry to come before i sleep =P  later dudes!
