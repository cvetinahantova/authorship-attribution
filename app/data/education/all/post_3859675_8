I don’t know why I haven’t written in a week or so.  BAD NEWS: Well I think my dog, Baby, may be on her last legs. I hate that sometimes, that we became so connected to our pets and the something happens and they die. She hasn’t yet, but my family and I are trying to make her feel better until the time comes. Besides the fact Baby is sick, life is still good. I just feel like I should do more. But I cannot, besides pray and hope and to be ready for the time.  GOOD NEWS: Life is good but the whole pet thing. I will miss her. I don’t know what to really say or do, but I do know that we need, that I need, to look toward the positive side of life. To see the goodness that God created.
