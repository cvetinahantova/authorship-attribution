Waiting (With an Audience)   I've been lying on the railroad tracks  waiting in vain for your hyped arrival  drawing a crowd of ambulance chasers  discussing the finer points of survival   I know a whole lot of interesting people  plagued with information in their heads  who figure they hold the market on truth  sleeping within the void of empty beds   I've survived the unnoticed changes  guess I'm good at the nod and smile  sooner or later you face the enemy  I had a small role in that telecast trial   so please don't mind if I sit this one out  you bury the justice if you bury the losses  the trendsetters and trend followers alike  are making decisions in unfriendly coin tosses   now I'm standing by the road like a squirrel  gauging the odds of making it across  taking notes on the didn't-quite-make-its  trying not to lose faith pondering their loss   never thought time would be so time consuming  i need to start over and break some new ground  but it is so hard to set a lasting foundation  with pieces of your past scattered around   been too long a self-destructive concession  years of painting tragic comedies for profit  self pity and denial are too strong a drug  a price apparent when you come down off it   spiraling down slowly to this reflection of me  may be what I chose - may be what I've adjusted to  trying to be able to look myself in the eyes  and accept the product's uncertain overview   Â©2003 DC Vision
