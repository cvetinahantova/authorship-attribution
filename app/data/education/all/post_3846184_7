(Title to be read like that diet-guru in the early 90's was famous for saying "Stop the Insanity!")   Okay, so I lost this fairly lengthy post on this topic on Sunday when my computer suddenly and mysteriously re-booted all on its own, and I haven't had the time or energy to re-create it...basically, I have been noticing some major obsessive signs creeping in, more and more each cycle of trying, and I've decided to nip them in the bud.  I'm not changing anything significantly, really, not stopping ttc by any means, not stopping charting my temps just yet since I still need that daily check-in and pattern to follow each month, not to mention the "data" it provides, clinical and cold sounding or not (I am a researcher after all).  I am, however, going to do my best to curb the obsession. No more pressure, no more guilt, no more reading into every little twinge and twang. I am trying my best to change my attitude.  Yeah, we'll see if this lasts the 2 week wait. It's good intentions that count, right?  Anyway, for now, I am trying to remember what it's like to live life without the colored glasses of a woman desperately trying to conceive after miscarriage. I don't want to be desperate, and I don't need to be desperate. There is time, and if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. I have to keep in mind my major lessons in life...patience and faith. Both have been tested a hell of a lot this past year, but if I don't learn, I'll continue to be tested.  Here's trying, with as much patience as I can muster, and in good faith...  _____________________________________________________________   Many thanks to my visitors and your comments, by the way! Sorry it took me so long to say so, never mind say much of anything on here. Life's been a little crazy, but I so much appreciate y'all finding me and taking the time to say hello.
