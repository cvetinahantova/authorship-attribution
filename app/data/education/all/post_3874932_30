In my reading on adoption and diffusion, I've run across a citation of two papers by Hirschman on Consumer Creativity.  The first is "Innovativeness, Novelty Seeking and Consumer Creativity" (1980),  JCR , December, 283-295.  The other one is "Consumer Creativity: Nature, Measure and Application," in  Theoretical Developments in Marketing , eds. Charles W. Lamb Jr. and Patrick Dunne, Chicaco: Amercian Marketing Assocaition, 162-165.  Hope, are these of interest to you?
