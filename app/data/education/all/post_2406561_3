I'm incredibly bored right now, trying to work on my  Of Mice and Men  English paper, Mrs. Green assigned. God, how I hate her. She is the worse teacher I've had in my life -- after Mr. Martinez who insists on bothering me  EVERY FREAKING DAY  of my natural born life. Kthx. Go away now.   Anyway, my head hurts. A lot. I think I'm starting to go insane, because last night I had a dream that I was Rachel Bilson. Omfg. That would've been awesome. Making out with Adam Brody? Heck yes.   But back to reality, where I do  not  (sad, as it is) make out with Adam Brody. In fact, I don't make out with anyone. How pathetic is that? Flirting = teh sux0rs.   In other news, I've gained about 30 pounds within the last three days. Hip hip hooray. Must make plans to do some sort of physical excerise besides watching television, or going on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM tm).   The glory of my life. Le sigh.
