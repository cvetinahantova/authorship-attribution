Now,I am on the stage of drafting my position paper as well as my research paper...   With restricted thesis, a preliminary outline and plenty of notes, I am ready to write my first draft.         What I am doing right now is to keep it rough and keep it moving. I do not let my wish for perfect sentences stall me at this stage.From the ideas and supporting details, I will polish my sentences later. By writing rapidly, I think it might produces a more natural,individual voice and helps to avoid echoing the language of my sources.         One thing for sure, a chatty, breezy voice is usually not welcome in this academic papers.  As though I believe in my main point and are interested in my subject, I will try to communicate that sense of conviction.
