I just feel like crying.   And if I bleed, I'll bleed... Knowing you don't care. If I sleep just to dream of you But wake without you there, Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?   I've had such a crummy day. First off, it felt like it was a Monday, which is always a horrid thing.   Well, actually, my day started pretty well, but it transformed into a not-so-hot day later on. I went to pick Mandy up since my mom offered to drive us to school. Her three-year old brother Tyler slid down the steps and screamed, "Mallowee, Mallowee is here! My girwlfriend come to say hi!" So I guess I have a three-year old boyfriend... :-) Yay~ He makes me feel loved. ;-)  Theatre arts was boring. Spanish was boring -- but I got a 46/50 (92%) on my Negative TÃ¹ commands quiz. Yay. Math stunk. Biology was quite interesting.  Then Keniesha ruined my day by blackmailing me just because she has a quick temper and wanted payback for something I didn't do. She's pissed cause she needs a psychiatrist and her record's ruined, but it's not my fault and all I try to do is be the mediator between my two friends, and it all freakin (excuse me, sorry) blows up in my face.  I wanted to smack Keniesha, but I couldn't because it wouldn't be right. Why am I the middle-woman here? Why? Why me? I don't mean to feel self-centered or sorry for myself, because I'm not. I just don't get it.   "A friendship's not a friendship if it's hard."  If it was hard to be friends with someone, you wouldn't be friends. If keeping a steady ground as friends was too hard to handle, two people just aren't friends. That's why (the first example that comes to mind) Paula and Hannah and people like that aren't friends with me, because it's too hard. I'm not a wuss, not a baby, but when you can't be friends you aren't friends. I'm even getting lost in my own reasonings.  But hey, on the bright side, I did 25 seconds faster on my timed mile today than last week, and 10 seconds faster than the first time I did the timed mile. I'm pretty happy, I guess. Yes, very happy. Caitlyn improved her time by 20 seconds, and has improved by three minutes since the first day of practice. Yay for Caitlyn! "I love my track Ohana!" --Caitlyn...  Five days until the meet, six until surgery. Still counting down.  At least I get out of Mr. Bright's class and Mrs. Parker's class...most of P.E. too, next Friday. I don't know how that next Monday will turn out though.    "And if you do not want to see me again...                                         I would understand.           Can you put the past away?"
