Human Beings have always had a problem with change.  We like to be where we are, and would like to keep it that way.  If we could be happy all the time, we could choose to; it’s just our nature.  Now, of course, that never happens.  Last time I tried to use a remote to pause my life, I got several odd looks from people.  Alas, it did not work.  In fact, many people spend their entire lives running away from change.  Child Stars constantly try and reestablish their careers, old celebrities try to steal the spotlight, and old politicians always run from themselves every election year.  These people spend their lives trying to improve their life by becoming what they were, and in the process, become nothings.  So running away from change doesn’t work.  It makes sense though; change is said to be the only constant. The standard. The certainty. The absolute.  Those of us who understand this fact use it to our advantage: we seize the present, but look forward to the future, and are mindful of the past.  Change is an unlimited resource for all of us to use.  For those who use it, they gain the knowledge and courage to lead tomorrow.  For those who deny it, they are left behind in the dust of the past.   Go with the flow.
