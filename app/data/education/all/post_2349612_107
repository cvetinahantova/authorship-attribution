completely unrelated topics, but 2 thoughts  (1) got a can of the new altoids -- apple sours... they're pretty good... comparable quality to the tangerine sours... better than the citrus ones =)  party  (2) eric and i worked on analysis for like the last 5 hours here at my place... partway through amanda came out of her room and said she had a show she really wanted to watch, so we gladly moved for her and started to work at the kitchen table... what do we hear when she turns on the TV but, "stay tuned for 'my big fat obnoxious fiancee' coming up next!"... eric's expression was pretty hilarious... i'm sure mine was comparable... we quickly decided to hide from the TV in my room to work... but dude, who makes up these shows?  i'm a little frightened of my TV now!  the end... good night!
