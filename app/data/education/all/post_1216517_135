I'm going to Baja soon.  Awesome!  Billy, Dan, Keith and I are going down the 19th-24th.  That's the plan for now.  Merry Baja Christmas.  Fish tacos, here we come!  I love it down there.  Time for relaxation.  Substitute teaching is a lot of fun.  It's odd to have kid calling me "Mr. Harbaugh."  For the younger ones, I spell it out phonetically: Mr. Har-baw.  It's close enough.  My last name can give anybody trouble, let alone first graders.  Half the time it's 'Harbough'.  That's how it sounds, so it's good enough.  I can't spell or pronounce half the kids names, so guess that makes us even.  My first day of subbing, the school secretary introducted me to all the teachers as "the good-looking new substitute that we hope comes back here more often."  Great, all I need is 50-year old women hitting on me.  "Have any daughters, Lady?"  Things are good.  I've got an apartment.  A job.  A car.  not bad.  This all in a month.  I'm on my game.  This morning I washed dishes.  I don't think I've done that in a year.  AND...I'm washing my laundry this minute.  This is laundry that was dirty since before I left to go home to Michigan on Nov. 4.  Yeah, my housekeeping skills rule!  Went down to this crazy Christmas parade in Belmont Shore (part of Long Beach).  We (me, Billy, Brent) had a contest to guess how many people we there.  I said 16k.  Brent said 11k.  Billy said 14k.  Dan said 5k.  Yeah.  The paper the next day said there were 70,000.  We suck.
