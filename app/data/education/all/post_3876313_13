Saw the doc on Tuesday for the first monthly checkup. Everything went swimmingly. We had the chance to listen to the baby's heart beat as provided by a doppler. I must admit it was pretty cool to know that a tiny little heart's already beating. Jessica was so excited she teared up!  And, of course, we had a way of recording the moment. So you can  urlLink listen to the heart beat  yourself.
