YOU DIDN'T GET MY VOICE MESSAGE   The new phone messaging system is not completely operational at this time.  While your phone will not diplay the fact that you have voicemail messages, you might.  An alternate form of checking the mail exists until the system is fully operational.  Please refer to the campus wide email from Buck for more information or call the Tech Services Office.
