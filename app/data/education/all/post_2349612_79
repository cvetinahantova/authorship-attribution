by now you've read me rambling many times in the past few months complaining how i'm in a funk... scott suggested a week ago that we should have a margarita night since i like those, so last night at no math night we bought $40 worth of jose cuervo, a big thing of triple sec, some lime juice, and some strawberries, and some ice, and made frozen margaritas for all the people.  we made them a bit strong, i had 2, and it was probably a little too much, strength of drink taken into consideration, but they were good.  unfortunately all alcohol does to me is make me tired, so i left around midnight and crashed for 11 hours.  now, it's homework day.  at any rate, me and my attitude probably gets boring after awhile, so funk or not, that's not the main topic today.  brother just got online to cheer me up and sent me 3 pictures that are really cute from around our house in memphis yesterday.  (1) this is a baby squirrel that was in a nest in a tree that got cut down at brother's job on thursday.  they didn't see the baby or the nest til after the tree was done... it's so small it hasn't opened its eyes yet.  rather than leave it die (how's the mother going to find it in a tree that's not there anymore?), ryan's secretly taking care of it in his room when he's home, and keeping it in his shirt pocket while he's in classes at school, and bottle-feeding it.  top secret from parents-- don't tell.       i know it's a a small pic and little blurry, but that's the best focus i could get it... it's sitting in my brother's hand... his wrist it towards you and fingers behind the baby just to give a sense of its tiny size.  (2) the family has 4 baby goats now: these are bob and allie.        (3) and these are mary helen and mark:        that's a party, right?  yay for small animals... the end.
