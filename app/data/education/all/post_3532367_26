I arranged with a friend to drop off my old car this afternoon. I took it down to the auction rooms and they had it off me within 20 mins. I was quite happy as they didn't do an inspection that I could witness, so if I get a bill later on to say this and that "this was wrong and that was wrong" I can say I don't agree! Daft or what?
