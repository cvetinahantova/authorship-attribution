I'm sitting here watching the O'Reilly factor and Bill is interviewing the First Lady.  What a difference from what we've scene with Teresa Kerry.  Mrs. Bush comes off as a very educated and classy person.  I have a lot of respect for her and the things that she has accomplished.  I think I would love to sit and talk with her as much as I would like to sit with her husband, President Bush.  Contrast that with Mrs. Kerry.  I have to admit, some of the things she has said has made me laugh, but whenever I here her speak, I feel like I'm at the local pub.  Her supporters would just say that I don't like strong women.  If that was true, I wouldn't like Mrs. Bush.  Unfortunately, I get the feeling from  Mrs. Kerry that because she has a lot of money she thinks she can say or do what ever she wants, and I guess that's the heart and sole of the matter.  Modesty vs. arrogance.  And it's that's arrogance from both Mrs and Mr Heinz (I mean Kerry) that's going to return the President to the White House!
