The extravaganza came and went with beer and fun and kiddie pools. Hosted by the Olingers, we sat around and drank and talked and did what we usually do only with American flags stapled to the fence. Thank goodness for the staple gun. Our fun was turned into a sleepover when JOn locked his house keys in the church office and we had no way of getting home at 10pm at night. But it made it fun to be up again this morning goofing off and enjoying the magic of cable television. If we had it I'd never get anything done. Honest. It dawned on me that this year was the first year in three years I've been in the country to celebrate the fourth. I'm no patriot, but I must confess that driving around trying to find a key that would get us our keys right smack during the fireworks display left me a little sad. I don't usually cherish things American, but there's nothing better than a fireworks display off in the distance on a warm summer night, listening to tunes, beer in hand. Those moments are of the "Wow, life can be pretty great" variety. It's been a while since I've had the pleasure of finding myself smack in the middle of a moment conscious of how great and peaceful and satisfying things can be. Granted, they're all over the place within the time-space continuum, but being aware of them and savoring them is the part that rarely happens.  Personally, I wouldn't mind being abroad for the remainder of 4ths in my lifetime. Just as long as life is peppered with those satisfying moments of total contentment, then I wouldn't have to mourn the lack of fireworks again. Peace out.
