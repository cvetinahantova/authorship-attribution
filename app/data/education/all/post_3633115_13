About this time, 27 years ago, my mom was in the early stages of labor.  She would experience the joys of said labor until 8:24am Greenwich mean time (about 12:24am cst).  I specify the time because I was born at the  urlLink Royal Berkshire Hospital  in  urlLink Reading, England .  My dad was in the air force, and I hold dual citizenship.  That's right dear readers, tomorrow is my birthday. I will be 27. To some of you I am still a baby, to others I am an old lady.    To steal a line from Garth Brooks, "I'm much to young to feel this damned old."  I have no special plans for my birthday.  Majority of my family is 250 miles away (some even further than that), and S and Shorty just don't know how to throw a party.  Even if they did, we have no real friends here to speak of, so it would just be the three of us anyway.  So tomorrow when you are having dinner, or your morning Mimosa, lift a glass to me.  Hey, I'd do the same for you.
