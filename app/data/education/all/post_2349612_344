summary of my day:  *called cotton farmers for 3.5 hours -- well, really 3, and entertained my bosses 5 year old for half an hour while she was on a conference call and didn't want him playing in the background =P  *lunch with alissa (anderson) homes, ... we went to school together K-8 and she's now married 2 years, lives in mississippi and works as the district secretary for a clothing store chain... me, well i'm me... so we both get together once a year or so and ask lots of questions over lunch about what the other is doing, and then go our separate ways again :-)  *passed vehicle inspection!  i hate memphis vehicle inspection... mostly because of the brake test... put your car in drive, pull up the emergency brake and then stomp on the gas... and your car isn't supposed to go anywhere???  it's ridiculous... for once, i passed the first time through -- after sitting for an hour waiting in line in the 90+ degree heat without air conditioning (to get better emissions scores)... at least it's done, eh?  *another hour of cotton farmer calling  ...and now i'm home to do data entry... fun, eh?  later dudes :-P
