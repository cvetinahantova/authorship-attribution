this blog was written in school. sorry for stopping halfway and not continuing after...but anyway, here i am now...  went to bintan on saturday nite and i really enjoyed myself! went snorkelling and got a nice deep tan...although it hurt quite a lot when i first got back to school on monday night! watched the euro '04 finals in the hotel the night before until about halftime...i surrendered to my sleepiness! surprising huh? greece won afterwards. when i watched it, portugal seemed like the team to nab it. by the way, my favourite player in portugal is cristiano ronaldo. his footwork is so damn cool, but i wish he had less shiny ear studs...  heard a couple of new songs this week and here's what i liked: Ashlee Simpson - Pieces of Me Janet Jackson - All Nite (Don't Stop) Counting Crows - Accidentally in Love Avril Lavigne - My Happy Ending Linkin Park - Breaking the Habit Kim-Lian - Teenage Superstar  btw, my chinese listening compre last saturday was fine, but it was harder than my practice papers of the previous years so it was kinda tricky at first...and oral comes later this month!  so its been a great week overall...going for braces' tightening on saturday! yikes its gonna be painful! and yup i have friendster now, after so many of my friends have been pestering me to join it! so add me at  danieltingkh@earthdome.com ...hey i think i posted this before! but anyway i gotta go! see you guys around!
