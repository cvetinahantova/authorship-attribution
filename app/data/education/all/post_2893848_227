Meet me in the Occult Section of Barnes & Noble   It occurred to me the other night that I knew a lot of people in high school who insisted they had magical powers.  And this wasn't, "I can run the speed of sound," or "I can fly," but "I pickle frog's brains, make a paste of them mixed with a lock of my true love's hair, and offer it up to my god on an altar of pine boughs.  I may or may not wear a cloak."  These kids had a patient answer for every skeptical question and they corroborated each other's abilities.  Some of them were the sorts of kids who otherwise seemed to be the type that would claim such powers (long hair, acne, dungeon master's guide, etc), others did not.  Some of these kids aligned themselves with the forces of light, others Satan.  It was all very confusing for me, fourteen and trying to distinguish the sometimes counterintuitive facts of adulthood from this elaborate bullshit.  I was never fully convinced, but there were times when they outnumbered me, and would all enter a trance of astral projection while I stared at the woodpaneling or played Sega.  Sometimes it seemed that I was the only person in the world who was skeptical, that even the basketball team was slinging incantations here and there.  To this day, I have a vestigial belief in the occult that parallels my feelings on the Catholicism of my youth: I don't want to be punished for getting it wrong.  I would like to avoid an unnecessary hex/damnation.  This is not so much a belief as  urlLink a placating gesture toward forces that may or may not exist .    Some of these witches and warlocks are still friends of mine, and as far as I know, when they look back onthis period of their lives with embarrassment.  But I can't be sure, because I'm not really sure how to bring up the topic.  Okay, yes, I'm a little afraid to bring up the topic.
