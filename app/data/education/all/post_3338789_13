Hooray!  It took me 3 days, 13 hours a day, but I finished it.    urlLink http://photobucket.com/albums/v233/nineightohone/Crafts/?action=view&current=1DSC00137.jpg   You like? :)  I'm so excited I can hardly stand it.  I only broke 1 needle, 1 presser foot (the embroidery one during the topstitching), and the plate that covers the feed dogs....figures.  Anyway, if you like it, tell me by leaving a comment! :)  Meeeeeee
