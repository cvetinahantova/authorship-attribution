Don't get the wrong impression.  He's really a nice guy.  He's just out for one thing, I think.  Well, at least he's convenient!  And, if he ever cheats - all I have to do is walk outside or peek out the window and I'll have a pretty clear view.    There are some distinct advantages to dating a neighbor.  He is always there.  And some advantages, he is always there.  Going out with someone who has seen you at your worst can be pretty interesting.  I don't get dressed to the nines to go to Walgreens, and he sees that.  He also sees the done up me when we've gone out - and he likes that very fine thank you. :)  He is a little older, a month shy of 10 years older... and like the Irish Laddie has no kids and no past marriage.  He is cute.  Unlike the IL at just attractive.  The thing with NN is, he doesn't do events or gatherings... he is more of a couple thing dater, and not a double dater even.  He mentioned once that he wouldn't marry someone with kids unless hers were out of the house.  Um, hello, there are 2 kids in my house and I don't see the little one going anywhere for another 13 years or so.  Hmmm...  Was it just a flippant comment?  I don't think he knew I heard that - we were standing with a group of other neighbors.    He is 'interesting' and I like that, but the only thing - I would eventually like to settle down.  Not in the very near future, but hopefully before little one is off to college!  And if I wait that long - gosh, he'll be 60ish!  Forget it.
