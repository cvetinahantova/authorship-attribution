Hi all...the title should say everything.  I weant back through these posts...I AM WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY OFF.  I don't even know what to say..i'm sitting here thinking of what the heck to say and I don't know what to....other than that i blew up.  Just read the below for me...please...don't take offense to it...just read it and try to let it soak in, just please...please don't let this get in the way again ok?  We're all WAY too close for us to be broken off like Preston.  Screw him..ok...he went his own way because he couldn't tollerate "talking" to us.  Got a beef, talk to the person.  Arguments and fights are ok...we'll get over them and patch everything up.  I'm just trying to find myself...I found it while camping..showed it to JR.  I need to show it to all of you.  I'm gonna fill out one of these profiles things that kev and Paige did and see what I found out and what i can show you.  I do have a sense of humor..really...but its hard to find what to say to make everything ok in a funny way.  Thanks guys!
