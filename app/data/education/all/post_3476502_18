Music: Angel With the Scabbed Wings - Marilyn Manson Mood: healing up ************************  Blah, well, after thinking I felt better, I got really sick... won't go into the details or anything... but it was bad... bad enough to make my mom almost take me to the emergency room! But I'm all better now! ^_^!  I'm watch Mash right now... or M*A*S*H*...  Wow, my nails are really growing! w00t w00t! GROW NAILS! GROW! heh, I'm just hyper now... I've been stuck in bed for almost a week...! I'm working on a drawing of the girl from 'The Craft'... I'm drawing her when she has curly hair and that cool dress and pointed witch shoes! I SMELL FRENCH FRIES!! Doom...! TV is annoying... >.>...   Well, I watched this hentai called 'Black Mail' (thanks Matt for letting me borrow it!) and because it, I've decided to become a lesbain! It was a good hentai though...! I liked Yumiko... she was cool... but the mom was freaky... the enima's were gross... and Aya got hot when she grew up!  Doooooom, gonna go look around at random shit...! Dooom! Love all!
