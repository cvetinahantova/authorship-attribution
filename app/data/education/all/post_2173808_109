"Dad was also a deeply, unabashedly religious man," Ron Reagan Jr. said before the final homily. "But he never made the fatal mistake of so many politicians - wearing his faith on his sleeve to gain political advantage. True, after he was shot and nearly killed early in his presidency he came to believe that God had spared him in order that he might do good. But he accepted that as a responsibility, not a mandate. And there is a profound difference."   Hmmm, I wonder whom he could be thinking of?
