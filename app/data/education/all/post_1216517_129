Yesterday, was one of the better days that I've had in a while.  I looked though all these boxes full of old pictures. Pictures from High school, Jr. High, Elementary, and earlier.  It was great.  I love looking at pictures and putting myself back at the exact instant that flash bulb went off. Or thinking about all the stuff that�s happened in the time in between then and now.  I found some old notes.  Bordering on love letters really, but a Christian teenager version.  I�m a sucker for nostalgia, man.  The women I�ve been in love with, whether I was 14 or 15 or whatever, they are idealized.  These two girls in particular, Sarah Ann Foote from Arroyo Grande, California and the other Alania Caridi from Lord�s Valley, Pennsylvania, they were it.  They rocked my pre-drivers license world.  Everything was so dramatic from me at that age. The thing is, I find pictures of them in this box in my Dad�s damp shed. I haven�t thought about them in forever, but I see these pictures or read these notes and I�m like, �Alas, I will never love another as I did her, the perfection of woman.�  Damn. I heard Sarah was married.  I haven�t talked to either of them in 7 years though.  They probably both have grandchildren by now. I did find a picture of me kissing a girl. That�s always a bit shocking. Ever take any of those? Yeah? Well, I have. Plenty. And let me tell you, they suck. The pictures are dumb too. I had forgotten about this, but the big thing when you see people you haven�t talked to in awhile is �So do you have a girlfriend?�  Then you have to explain yourself. Well, I�m content with not being in a relationship, you know?  Well, I was until about the 50th time someone asked me who my girlfriend was.  I can hear these people now.  �Darren was always such a good boy, but since he went to California, I think he�s gotten a bit �funny�.�  Yeah.  F-off, Grandma. I know what my deal is with women though, I�m not aggressive with the ladies. At all.   I need to go up to hot women and then tap the Harbaugh.  Once the Harbaugh is tapped the ladies with be unable to resist.  And you know, most ladies with go for the funny man, even if he�s not a uber-attractive metrosexual. At least that�s what Maxim said. Shut up.  I�m going to bed.
