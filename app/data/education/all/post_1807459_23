Well normally I blog at the wee hours of the morning but I have a little free time here so I'll go ahead and get it done.  Poor Braves.  Out after 5 last night.  They've played poorly and now they'll get going home.  I guess it is nothing new for them to screw up in the postseason.  I shouldn't be so annoyed.  I'm sure there are people who would love to be as disappointed as I am.   Tomorrow I'm going up to Atlanta to get my visa.  All my documents showed up today so I should be on my way back to Korea come Friday or Saturday.  I'm dreading the flight back over but I'm so looking forward to getting back.  I'll also have to say some last minute hellos and goodbyes tomorrow.  I need to see my grandparents again and I have an aunt and uncle I need to go see.  Anyway tonight is trivia night at Hooters.  I think we are just going there to drink.  The trivia is pretty lame and deals with everything redneck.  But seeing as how I grew up here I'm able to hold my own.  Wish me luck.
