I think digital cameras will replace SLR film cameras in the public market.  I do think "regular" cameras will remain in the photo world for photographers.  As technology advances and becomes easier, faster, and more user-friendly, more and more people will catch on and begin to use digital cameras.  I personally enjoy my digital camera.  I am on my second one.  My first was cutting edge at the time because it had a place to put a floppy disk right into the camera.  It was fairly expensive and was a 1.5 megapixel camera (which, at the time, was about as good as you could find on the mainstream market).  Now, my camera holds an SD card (much smaller and more memory) and is 5 megapixels.  All this for about half the price!  I will continue to use digital cameras (both still and video) for personal and school use.  They are a vital tool in the educational process.  For me, digital video has superior sound quality and allows us to evaluate performances through video and audio.  It also allows us to put together a collaboration project of the year featuring video and audio elements from throughout the year.
