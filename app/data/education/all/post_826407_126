Since my birthday I've been given/bought a couple of music dvds- Never really thought of it before but now I can watch music as well as listen.  The first one was the  urlLink Zen TV DVD  - a lot of the videos have a distinctive future/retro feel about them.  Its got the Coldcut/Hextatic classics on it - Timber and Natural Rhythm.  I think my favorites are  the two Funki Porcini videos.   "What are You looking at" Starts very peaceful, with amazing close ups of flowers and then as the music gets a bit crazy/jazzy/prophetic.   A dandelion explodes you follow a single seed.  It was very powerful.   The other one"Atomic Kitchen" is just very clever and beautiful.  I also like the Kid Koala animated videos, one of them seems to involve a funeral procession turning into a carnival and the everyone floating off into the sky.  Reminded me a bit of " urlLink The Resurrection " by Stanley Spencer in that both allow spiritual beauty into the everyday  Ninja Tune has been stretching the boundaries of Music and Visuals for a while so its very cool to see it all here.  The other one was the Massive Attack 11 Promos DVD.  I've wanted it for a year or so.  Obviously the videos do have a much more mainstream feel then Ninja and there are lots of moody shots of various band members.  Several of the videos seem to involve extraordinary, real life.  My favorites are Protection (Tracy Thorn and the band in a block of flats.  Strange things going on now and again) and best of all Angel where Daddy G is chased by band members and others through a vast car park.  As the song reaches its end he is forced to confront his pursuers.  Amazing and victorious.  I was a bit down when I watched it last week and it helped me pray.
