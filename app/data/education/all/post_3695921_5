Today I´ve had a training teaching at UP Language Berrini, as they say, and again I found out that I´m sick and tired of teaching.  BORING!!!!!!!!!! I love speaking English and learning new things about the language. but being a teacher has become a sacrifice and a real pain. Everytime, I talk or see someone who´s getting along with teaching well, I also feel jealous because I used to be like that and then it´s gone slowly.  I wish I were a jornalist or work with something different and fun. This would be a sort of job where I´d feel great being there rather than staying home for a change.  I remember having this feeling when I worked at PBF. It was good and I felt my locker as something sacred, really mine. It was a good feeling. Today, I´m bored most of the time and complaining too much. Why can´t the oppotunities knock on my door? Why are they taking so long? I want to change , to move and do something I really enjoy. I´m not 18, but I want a revolution in my life.
