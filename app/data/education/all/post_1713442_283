urlLink School-Libraries.Org: Information Literacy and Library Skills Online Resources for School Librarians  This is a good easy to use list of Web resources that deal with information literacy.  This includes sections for General Information, Library Instruction, Web Page Evaluation, Web Page Evaluation Instruction, and Tutorials.  The big drawback in this site is that it has not been updated in 2 years.  (I guess that explains why an important site such as LibraryInstruction.Com is not listed.)
