So, I haven't been very good about writing lately.  This is not the best time of year for teachers.  After Spring Break, time seems to accelerate at the same time you realize that there are several important things you meant to teach this year that you haven't gotten to yet.  Staring at your plan book in a blind panic, you then attempt to schedule all of these miscellaneous lessons and realize that it's just not going to happen.  By the way, I didn't get anything accomplished over Spring Break like I had planned. My parents bought us a computer (it's a long story) so I spent my spare time setting it up and arguing with my husband about where in the house we'll put it (doesn't the study seem like a logical place to you?)
