We've Been Discovered  It turns out our little private blog isn't so private any more. "Shayne Power" left a comment on one of Morgan's post, to our surprise. A little research (eg, the phone book) revealed that he lives not too far away. So if you want, drop around to his blog  urlLink View from the POWERstation . On a side note Hawkins has also been dropping around and reading posts. I guess I better make him a member, lol. So here's to being discovered.
