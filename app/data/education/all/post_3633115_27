So if you are willing to read my blog, you should probably know who the Cast of Characters are that I will reference most often.  My husband shall forevermore be referred to as  S . We have been married for five and a half years and still going strong.  We met in high school and despite the odds are still madly in love.  Our son is to be known as  Shorty , until he finds out about this blog, or grows taller than me.  That probably won't take to long as he is growing like a freakin' weed and is only three and a half.  Then there are the supporting roles of my parents Mimi and PePaw and my inlaws Mimaw and PePaw.  Shorty named them, what can I say.  I also have various other folks who will undoubtedly be included along the way, but I have yet to develop usable names for them.  (read that as things I don't want them to think I think about them should they actually locate this blog).  Of course I probably shouldn't add that part either, but what the hell.
