Man I'm tired.  This is the first night is forever that I haven't been downtown going completely "giver."  Literally this is my first night home in over a week.  I think I'll enjoy it buy going home and doing other then watching tv.  I have so save what little energy I have left for Friday.  I dread going to Outback with 30 or so people.  I think that will be nothing but chaos.   I saw pretty decent movie, as far as Korean movies go, last night.  It as about two bothers in the Korean war and I have to say it was fairly graphic and somewhat moving.  There was still the slightest hint of Korean cheesiness to it but whatever.  The name of the movie literally translated is something like "Korean flag blowing in the wind."  I saw it with Gyeh-son and have to say that things went well.  She seems like a cool girl and I'll probably see her again.   The rest of you bloggers need to update.  Only Gabe had something fresh for me to read today.  I have nothing else to say.  I think it's time to go home and pass out.
