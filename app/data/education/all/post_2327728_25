Ha ha ha!  I was just telling my friend Kerry about my encounter with Mr. Redneck.  I also told her about Andrew-the-super-crush, and how it appears that I have missed out on my soulmate (oh! the melodrama!).  She made a really good point: Had I asked out Andrew a year ago, it would have turned out that he was an English major, failing every course, completely without direction, and a total asshole.  By virtue of the fact that I *didn't* ask him out, he is a genetics genius who has several top schools foaming at the mouth (of course, there is still no indication of whether he is an asshole or not, but in keeping with the theme of my life, let's assume is amazingly nice and thoughtful and lovely in every way).  I think the fact that Mr. Redneck was the first guy I was *thinking* about kissing in...uhem, quite some time, proves her logic.
