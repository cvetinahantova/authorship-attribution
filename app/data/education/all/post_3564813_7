Wow. I went cycling today as part of Activites week we went all the way to Barnby. I'm really tired now, Darren's done it all week! Anyway - Shrek 2 is nearly done and I want to watch it later. I feel like randomly printing out stuff... because the school printer is really fast.  Anyway I saw Ms Tindle on tuesday and her baby! I took a picture of them (I was doing photography). I left the picture up in the art dept. and Laurence went up there at tok a  picture  of a  picture.  I really don't think Laurence wants it in there. I'm gonna ask him to remove it.
