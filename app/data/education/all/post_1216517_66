from sunday  District 51 Big League ready to roll  By DARREN HARBAUGH Valley Press Staff Writer  For most Little Leaguers, the season has already come to a close, but for the girls who play Big League softball, the postseason is just beginning. On Sunday and running through Wednesday, the Antelope Valley All-Star Big League Girls softball team will host the Western Regional Championships at Dominic Massari Park in Palmdale. The team is made up of 16- to 18-year-old girls representing a number of area high schools: Desert, Desert Christian, Highland, Littlerock, Palmdale, Paraclete, and Quartz Hill. The team provides an opportunity to hone their skills in the prep offseason and showcase their talents to a number of college scouts. The big showcase comes to the winner of the Regionals. That team will advance to the Big League World Series in Kalamazoo, Mich. Last year, the AV All-Stars finished third there. �You get a lot of exposure there,� said Vanessa Marroquin, a three-year member of the Big League squad and recent Desert High graduate, �A lot of schools contacted me just because they saw me play there.� The World Championships involves ten teams, each from a different world region, six from the United States and one from Canada, the Far East, Latin America, and Europe. The AV All-Stars won the World Championship in 1996 and have been to the Championships each of the past three years. �It�s just a fun thing,� said Paraclete�s Tayler Wilson, who was part of the team�s third-place finish at the World Championships last year. �It�s real different to be playing against people from all over the world. It�s a great experience.� Besides being loaded with all-star talent from around the Valley, the team is blessed with a wealth of experience on the beach. The team�s manager Walt Pattison has more than 20 years of experience with youth softball. He guided the Park View Junior softball team to a World Championship in 1997. He is also the varsity softball coach at Highland. Assistant coach Ray Beltrami led the Big League softball team to the World Championship in 1996 and Scott Rutledge, the other assistant, has 15 years experience in youth baseball. �I feel very confident about the girls,� said Pattison, �We have more hitting and good speed this year. We�ll be ready for Sunday.� The team�s first game of the tournament will be against a team from Portland, Ore. at 8:00 p.m. on Sunday night and the players are confident in their abilities as well. �We have just as much skill this year (as last year),� Wilson said. Even with the great success of past teams, this year�s group of girls may have even more potential. �We�re a good hitting team one through nine. Maybe better than past years,� said Beltrami. But the true test will be when they take the field on Sunday. �The experience is there,� said Rutledge. �They just have to put it all together.�
