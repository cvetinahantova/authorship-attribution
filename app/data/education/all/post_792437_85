Another Interview..    Â  I had yet another interview for a doctoral position at the department of microbiology through a medical school. This school is ranked 24th in the nation. The research at the school is amazing! I really enjoyed it, and would love to go there. Heck, I am still stuck on Purdue....what if I like this school better? Do I turn down Purdue University?? I can't decide anymore!  Admissions decision for this school be made by at least tomorrow or wednesday...I think that my chances of getting in are 99.9% :)
