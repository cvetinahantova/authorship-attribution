I'm still not sleeping, I've woken every day at 01:00 and 04:00. I've got the doctors today so I must remember to ask for some help.  I've got mixed emotions from last night, Sandra got into bed and said "right lets get it over with then" (referring to sex). I told her I didn't want it to be like this but she insisted saying "come on, then you can leave me alone." She pulled down her night clothes and lay a towel on the freshly made bed and lay there. I wasn't allowed to touch or kiss and when we had finished she got up and had a shower. I know I have used her and she probably feels like she has been raped, but despite the situation I just couldn't say no!  I know there is something seriously wrong with me to feel like this and treat the preson I love the way I do, but I can't stop it and I am getting increasingly worried about it - I need help!
