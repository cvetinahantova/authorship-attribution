Bloody up at 02:30 again, eventually got out of bed and made a hot milky drink at 03:00. I had hoped it would settle me down, but it seemed to wake me up all the more. I watched TV for half an hour, then hit the PC and mailed Angela. I got a reply almost instantly as she was on night shifts at work, so that was it; stage set for 2 hours of chatting online via email - I dont think she got much work done.  Eventually went to bed at 05:30, dropped off at about 6 then was woken 30 mins later by the alarm.....lovely!  I got into work really late. Simon collared me and said he thought he had dropped me in it. Apparently when his Mom rang him later that day he asked how I was as I had gone off sick. She of course had said she had been there all afternoon and hadn't seen me.   Talk about quick thinking, I used the phone excuse and not wanting to go home with MIL and kids there. Bluffed my way through saying I went to the park. It seemed to work, but I was so involved that an hour later I even told Mia the same story. While I was telling her I kept thinking "she will only read the truth later, why are you feeding her this crap" but I was too far gone to back track and it would give me practise in sounding convincing if I was quizzed by Sandra later.  Sorry Mia
