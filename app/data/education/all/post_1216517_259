I'm always not home this time of year.  It feels more at home to be not at home July-mid Sept.  I have been in Ventura painting for money.  I'll be going to Seattle in a couple weeks.  Gone for the b-party weekend.  Hawaii in Sept.    Pray for my Grandma.  It looks like lung cancer.  Not suprised, just sad.    I'm listening to Marty Robbins, about to finish the Great Dictator, and will see Jerry Stahl read some later tonight.  The Dodgers are 4-1 since the trades.    Jesse
