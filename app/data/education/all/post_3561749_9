i'm gonna start up a lil"kids these days" series. it's a tribute to all those annoying talks you've ever had with your grandparents, but a with a katrina kick to it all.   BABY FOOD   What's with all the baby food kids these days get? I was roaming around price chopper yesterday, looking for some pepperidge farm light style 7 grain bread when i fatefully stumbled upon the plethera of baby food and all that good stuff. whoah, i mean WHOAH! they have miniature plastic containers now that are stackable  and  resealable!! all we had were those round glass thingies with the twisted lids that didn't like to match up with their bottom half. and have you been in the pressence of the gourmet choices babies get?! there was dutch apple desert, chicken dinner with carrots and peas, plum apple grape juice, and things that i don't think were in english. it was like i walked into willy wonka's chocolate factory. whatever happened to mushy peas and that purple stuff you wanted to say was prunes but you just weren't sure?   am i the only one here who thinks that babies are eating a helluva lot better than us? for serious, i usually rock the salad, sandwich, fruit meal a la moi. it's as if the guys on iron chef are cooking up new baby food or something. gourmet baby food, i mean seriously. it's like i'm taking crazy pills.     kids these days don't know how good they have it. die gourmet baby food! word.
