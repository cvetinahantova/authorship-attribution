I've told Sandra I would like to service my car this weekend. It's been standing with the previous owner and the oil has congealed at the top of the rocker cover. I asked her if she would ask her Dad if I could do it there, as it's flat and he has a bigger tool kit than me. I've also indicated that I want to get my push bike in to get the gear cable fixed. I've estimated 25 UKP for the car and 25 UKP for the bike. I am hoping she will come with me to pay so that I don't have an opportunity to deceive her.  I finish early on Friday's so I am hoping to get the bike up this afternoon as part of my exercise therapy. It's about 2 miles away, so if the weather stays nice, I might go in shorts and try to jog back - LOL
