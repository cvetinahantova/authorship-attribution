Just hopping around this thing called 'Net and I came across a pleasant aroma of creativity and intelligence and thought I'd pass it along to my cultured readers.  It's not the prettiest website on the I.S., but you'll pardon the mess once you get to reading:    urlLink Classical Newbie    also check out her weblog:    urlLink The Journey    Renee Doirion, the creator of these literary nibblets, and I went to PCC together, but as I recall we were merely acquantainces... a real shame, because after reading some of her works, I would like to have gone back and forth in discussion on the VC Terrace (during social hours, of course) about a good number of things.  It would have been fun.  All nosalgia aside, check it out.  I particularly enjoyed her  urlLink Villanelle  as well as  urlLink Reaction .
