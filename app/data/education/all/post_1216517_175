i'm back and the tigers are 4-0.  what the freak else has happened since I went to baja?  man on mars?  one-world government.  damn.  i'll enjoy it while i can.  i'm burnt and peeling.  the sun liked me a little too much.  many stories, many good times.  big chill.  i read a book there.  It felt like i was reading my journal.  it's "blue like jazz" by Don Miller.  I feel it's a necessary read for any thinking Christian.  shoot.  it was incredible.  anyways, as a result I've decided to make a big effort to develop friendships with non-christians, give more of my time and money to the poor, and to tithe.  among other things.  check me on this in a couple months.  but it sucks, Christ called us to help the poor, to feed them, to care for the widows and the orphans.  I don't do squat.  It's in the bible for a reason.  It's supposed to be my job.  big conviction for me.
