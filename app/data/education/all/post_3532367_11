Sandra suggested we went out for a meal tonight. After some discussion we settled on a place, where we thought the prices would be reasonable. It was the first time we had been to a "Harvester" pub, but we really enjoyed the layout and the food. We had a really good time and for less than 25 quid all in. Sandra said that we should put it on my card for now, which I did.  On the way back, Sandra said she wanted to do the food shopping. I had my reservations, but she was understanding to a point and offered to drop me off at home. We discussed it further and I said that I would have to face up to it at some point. I got a couple of things on 3 for 2 offers, but Sandra seemed to be OK with them.
