Irony is crack for the well-educated.  urlLink  And I blame Eggers.   Maybe irony was once  urlLink rebellious  and  urlLink meaningful , but now it is such a recognizable fact of the cultural landscape that it has become an opiate of sorts.  Its rebelliousness has become illusory and, worse, it has become an act of complacency.  Because if part of the point is that "getting" the joke sets the "getter" apart, what happens when everyone gets the joke?  People only seem to be individualistic.  And apparently, that's good enough for a lot of us.  (And yes, this whole development is ironic and it might even be ironic that it is ironic, but, you know, fuck off).  I realize how difficult it is to make such points and not sound like a curmudgeon (or an elitist).  What concerns me more than people laughing at self-indulgent jokes that aren't funny is that amusement takes the place of meaning; the smirk replaces the smile and the tear; that the stakes are so low that it is impossible to miss the mark.  The stakes and effects are clear in literature, but maybe the problem is more than an aesthetic one; maybe this has cultural and political ramifications with even higher stakes.
