Hey, guys! I have to say that today is a pretty good day. One, because it is Saturday and I don't have to sit through any more long, and boring classes. Two, my mom and dad came to visit to help ease my anxiety about being away from them. I am going home with them this evening and will be back tomorrow night. Anyway, I mowed my grass today for the first time and sprayed for bugs, crabgrass, etc. I love working in the yard. It really is calming. It is a good way for me to focus. Anyway, just wanted to say that today is a great day.
