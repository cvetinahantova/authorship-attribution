Night before last, the sky was host to a dizzying, dancing array of color and rain.  It was the summer equinox, famous for the length of day AND being able to balance an egg on its honches.  When the sun settled on the horizon, it refracted purple.  Here in northern North Dakota, we were in the midst of isolated rain showers.  The patchy cloudwork and the precipitation falling from them had a purple hue.  Fascinating.  I had a dream last night.  What seemed to be hundreds of people were playing dodgeball on a playground.  My friend Mike and I were kick-ass.....as we always were.  We won, and we hugged.  I woke up to a sensation of tremendous sadness and aprehension in my chest; Mike died two years ago yesterday.  I've often wondered if those who have crossed sides (good euphimism, eh?) present themselves in our dreams......if only to say hi.  I miss him.  ___________________________________________________________   For shits....    You have a mysterious kiss.  Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect.  And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
