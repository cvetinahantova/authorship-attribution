I smile whenever I recall The special moments we have had; Walking always hand in hand Through the good times and the bad Sometimes, I think it is a dream -- The love you give me could not be; But then when you are in my arms There's no mistake in its purity. Whether I'm with you or far away, My thoughts are always drawn to you Like a compass pointing North To a love much more than true. Of all the people on this Earth -- How lucky a person can be; To have found the likes of you, my love, With who to share Eternity ~Matt Giguere~   To A Special Someone In My Life! (You Know Who You Are!)
