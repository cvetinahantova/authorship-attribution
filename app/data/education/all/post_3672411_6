Picture from a farewell outing with Ali last night..we made a  urlLink Rolaids is Relief  stop at Honest Ed's before starting the drinking binge..     Is it just me, or is this Elvis bust the sluttiest thing you've ever laid eyes on? Frosted blue eyeshadow all over the place, runny mascara, bubblegum pink lipstick outside the lines, and blush with 50% face coverage...apparently someone is out to make the  urlLink King  look like a  urlLink crack whore .  We had dinner at  urlLink Sushi on Bloor  (I don't think anyone could argue that you could get more food for $15 with tax and tip), then headed out to some patios in the Annex to knock back some drinks. A very weird thing happened when we were at Future's--I saw this science teacher who taught at my old high school walk by and he spotted me recognising him. I dropped my sister's name to him since science was never my fort√©, then I asked him about his wife who used to teach at my elementary school. It was all very weird. Then after saying goodbyes and such, he swings by his wife to say hello! That was kind of cute.  Yet more proof it's an eerily  urlLink small world .
