So! This week. Much rushage has occurred because of 2 coursework pieces due in on Friday (tomorrow, the day of my Leeds interview). School photos arrived this week aswell, leading to gangs of girls sitting around making self-pitying comments in the hope someone will pay them a compliment:  "My hair is fluffy" "My eyebrows are wonky" "My nose is shiny" "I've got a double chin" "I shouldn't have worn that top"  Get over it. It's done now, and if you want a different picture for the yearbook, shut up and find one. If you still want a decent, professional-looking photo then you're going to have to cough up the cash elsewhere. I can understand people being disappointed with their pictures, and that's fine. But PLEASE stop going on about it. Hmm, what else has happened... Nope, I think that's about it really. What an exciting life I lead!  I was talking to Kayla earlier. She's staying at Rich's house because she's feeling stressed and needs some support in order to sort herself out. Her MSN name last week was "Namarie Fairy In Love". In Love. In fucking Love. It's going to kill me, seeing them together at JYF, I just know it; I plan to snuggle up to my friends and hide away from them and their "In Love"-ness. And it's such a shame, because I really like Kayla. I am, of course, dubious about her choice of men, but that's nothing to hold against anyone. She's lovely and she deserves better. But why do I want him if she's too good for him? I don't consider myself below her... I keep telling myself, it's fine, it's fine, move on, move on, but I'm kidding myself. It's such a horrible feeling, waiting for a couple to break up.   Just waiting.  Ceff x   I'm just another score
