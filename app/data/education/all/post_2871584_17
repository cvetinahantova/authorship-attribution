A fairly uneventful day.  I got up at...noon.  Messed around on my computer a little.  Then Nicole and I went to the movies and saw "Secret Window."  It was a pretty weird movie.  I had read the book that it was based on back in high school, but I didn't really remember most of it, so the end was a total surprise for me.  I think I might have to dig it out and read it again, now that I have seen the movie.    When I got back, I began organizing.  The plan was to begin packing, but I don't have any boxes yet.  I think I'm going to see if I can get some from the Dining Hall tomorrow.  So for today, I just organized.  And while doing that, I listened to a bunch of Bobbi.  It's been a while since I have done that, and I was in hysterics.  (Note:  How sad is it that I could listen to Bobbi clips for four and a half days straight, and never repeat a single one?)  Oh!  And as a bonus?  While I was organizing, I found a $20 bill that I misplaced a while ago.  Wee!  And finally, since George proclaimed on his blog that he is a Republican, I *had* to share my own results with everyone.  lol.    Threat rating: Medium. Your total lack of decent family values makes you dangerous, but we can count on some right wing nutter blowing you up if you become too high profile.    urlLink   What threat to the Bush administration are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
