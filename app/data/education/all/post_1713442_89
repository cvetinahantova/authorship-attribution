urlLink Michigan Library Association Conference  Short post today as I am at the Michigan Library Association Conference in Lansing.  I am not presenting this year so I can devote myself to professional development and fun.  I plan on hitting sessions on government data, project management, and new fiction.  I will also hear the special speakers at the keynote and closing speeches today and Friday.
