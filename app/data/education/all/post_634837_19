a little poetry of our own   a little poetry of our own:  the gestures of humour circle around him like a glow, a light that makes the  darkness easier to bear.  her maiden song on performance for all to recognise  except herself as she slips away from the applause.  His enthusiasm that underscores a life of wearying yet patient,  exacting perfection.  we write our humanity with an inkless brush, and it seems as if all the strokes go awry; especially when  foot steps falter, the cheers die down, and the spots of darkness bore out sight from straining eyes.  we will never know how and when our poem ends. The twists and turns of the line are not restrained by a punctuation mark.  our little poems: who can draw figures out of them as our bodies intertwine in dance and song?
