When you find your way to a clearing amidst the tangled woods that have become your life, you're almost afraid to be happy with it all. My mother often tells me that I don't know how to be happy. Always waiting for the other shoe to drop, some would say. Well, not anymore. I'm trying to live. I'm trying to live as fully and as safely as possible.  It's the funny saying I have about guys in my life : "When you have none, there's no one...when one comes along, there's many". Meaning: when you're alone and feeling like no one is EVER gonna love you--no one ever seems to call, be around, ask you out, etc. BUT when someone takes an interest in you, all of a sudden you have darn near a fan club. I mean new ones, "just friends" ones, even ones clawing their way out of the back of your heart. It's just not right, you know? I met several guys while I was out today and it was just kinda funny bc I can instantly tell whether or not I need to ever speak to the person again! (I try to be nice and open-minded, but when you KNOW what you want/need, why waste either person's time).  So anyway, life has felt so crazy.  You know I met K.  K and I have a cool connection as I already mentioned the other night. Well, K is great, nothing bad so far. --I don't know exactly what K wants. I definitely do feel a good connection with K, but I can never tell what the heck he's thinking.          So, like I said, I'm trying to live. I am going to spend more time on experiencing the process than on worrying about the outcome because that's what living is about. We can't spend our whole lives worrying about what our death is going to be--life is about all the days in between.
