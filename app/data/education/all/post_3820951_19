chatted with kel again this morning...  the guy's melancholic since a close friend will be leaving for japan soon... at first i couln't understand what he was trying to say to me and then he asked me this: "have you lost a best friend before?" and of course i have...it felt terribly heartbreaking to feel someone special slipping away from your life...i've had my share of losing friends...but nothing can be more hurtful than losing a bestfriend...that's because with a bestfriend, you really share your life and all your thoughts and all your dramas...and to lose contact with that being who's accepted you and loved you with all your eccentricities...it's just heartbreaking...  i do know what it feels like to lose a best friend...
