Monday is almost over... yayyyyyyyyy!!!  It was a pretty uneventful weekend.  Watched movies, hung out with Benz a little, cleaned my apartment.  That's about it.  I totally needed a weekend of peace and quiet to myself.  It was so nice just being mellow for once.  Today at lunch I went home, and Cop was there.  We're eating when all of a sudden someone starts banging on the front door, so i'm like who the fuck is knocking like the god damn PO-lice?  I open the door, and WTF?? it IS the police!  I was like.. ummm yeah??? They said they got a couple calls saying people could hear a domestic dispute and possibly violence going on in our apartment.  I was like huh??? Then Cop walks in (a bald black guy in a wife beater) and was like what's going on???  One of the cops was like "sir, let the lady talk!"  For some sick reason, I thought this was helarious!  So i put my head down mostly because I was trying not to laugh, and they thought I was trying not to cry.  The lady cop was just dying to cuff him, she kept giving him the dirtiest looks.  So they were like, ma'am... you need to tell us what happened.  Did he hit you???  Cop was looking at me like "you bitch!"  Then I busted out laughing and the 2 cops looked at me like what the hell?  I told them no, nothing was wrong, we were just home for lunch and there was so problem they must have the wrong apartment.  They kept asking if I was sure, then they left.  Cop was like "WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU DOING??? TRYIN TO GET ME LOCKED UP???"  I was like "see...  fuck with me again!  Next time you WILL get locked up!"  It took him a little while, but then he started laughing about it too.  He is starting to come around a little *knock on wood*.  Yesterday he invited me to his mom's for dinner, and asked me if I wanted to go to the lake this weekend for some party, maybe he finally realizes what a punk he's been.  Who knows.
