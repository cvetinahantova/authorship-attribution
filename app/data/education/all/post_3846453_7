Did you know that the Archers on BBC Radio 4 is the most dull program on this planet? Yes, yes it is. My parents insist on having it playing if it's 7:00pm, and we're eating dinner. I almost fall asleep in my food, even though it's usually incredibly yummy, and vegetarian. It is the ultimately dull and boring and blah blah blah. What is interesting... Oooh...Well, I know  other  people hate this subject in school, but I quite like it, Geography. I am one of the small handful in my year that took Geography GCSE, and I'm really enjoying it. It's really interesting, not like History. That's just dates and dead guys, (except for the mental bit, that sounded really good).
