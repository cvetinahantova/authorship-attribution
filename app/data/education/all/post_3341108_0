promlems never stops coming..they come..they go..if u surrender and teps back..people will say you're a coward.. no matter how bad it is..FACE IT! my problem is.. yah.. as usual.. having internal problem with my basketball team mates..i son't know why..but i really hope i will be solved as soon as possible..well..the point is..i'm damned worry of my team..they seem to have confidence in their selves.. ok that's fine but the kind of confidence they have is unusual..kind of Berlagak! I don't know if i'm the only person feeling this..maybe because i'm worrying too much.. but i really just hope that it is my worrying or else my greatest nightmare will come true..maybe because i'm not a good leader but how can they judge me for not being good?? To me a good leader is formed by good followers..and maybe i'm not good enough to have my own followers...yeah..there maybe some mistakes that i've done ..but please..tell me!
