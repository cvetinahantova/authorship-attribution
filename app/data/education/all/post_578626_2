Today was nice. It was my day off to play with The Boy. I met up with a friend of mine and we went to the park with the babies. Her son is a week younger than mine.   a lot of "SAHMS" (Stay at home moms)often tell me emphatically how busy they are. (Not the mom I was hanging out with today). But a lot of them are really defensive to me about their choice. I went back to work after a 12 week maternity leave. I think staying at home with your baby is a lot more difficult than going to work and getting a break from your baby. I am crazy about The Boy. Having a baby is like falling in that crazy falling-in-love that can be SO unhealthy when you're in you 20's. It's that rush, but it has none of the dangerous elements to it. But hanging out with a baby day-in-day out is exhausting. It's much easier for me to go to work and use the grown up part of my brain. I do feel bad for women who leave jobs that they didn't like that much, especially if they are in their 30's. It must be tough to be at that point in your career and not have found a job or a career that you're excited about. And I'm talking about women who have had all the advantages, good education etc. And after over 10 years in the workplace, they still don't like what they're doing. It's a bummer. In some ways, I wish I wanted to stay home with The Boy, but I think I'd really miss work. Plus, I work in IT, so I'd have to start over if I took a few years off. I feel very lucky that I even got to choose. These days I feel lucky most of the time. I wonder why America has this fear of aging. Perhaps our bodies start to disappoint us, but life keeps getting better. Most of my friends have started to settle down with babies and partners as we start to swim into our mid thirties. Some of them ended up with really horrible partners, but those are few and far between. Most of them are great partners.
