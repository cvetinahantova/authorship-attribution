Yeah... the networking class is awesome. I'm glad I didn't let the prison resemblence fool me. The parking lot sucks, and I'm really not so sure about the school, but the class itself is like sugar-coated... ethernet cables... or something. Anyway, I'm in the server group, installing and running Windows 2003 Server to create a domain for the rest of the class. There's also the Windows Xp Group, who connect to the network or something, and then the Network group, who actually program the routers and run the ethernet cables around and stuff. And then there's the Hardware group, who apparently put computers together. We already have a bunch of working computers, but I guess we'll have more or something.  Anyway, I'm off to... well, I was going to sleep, but that wasn't really working, so instead I'm just laying on the floor. It's all good either way, though. So, yes. Until tomorrow.
