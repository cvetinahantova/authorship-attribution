I'm starting a push to get a plane that I can fly to the scientific research station on Antartica.  I get to choose the occupants.  They can live in as much luxury as they can muster, perhaps beneath some dome on the frozen plain of the barren windswept landscape.   But they can't come back.  David Drier gets a seat.  None of the major administration officials can go.  They get a special flight to the Hague.  They don't come back either.  At least for 10 or 15 years.  I guess that the convention was a bust.  Because the right went around saying that they expected Kerry to get a big bounce.  Fifteen fucking points.  Yeah right.  That way, now that Kerry seems like he’ll get a smaller one or one at all, it’s a “disaster”.  Why do these people think we’re all so stupid.  Very interesting on Bill Maher.  You see my little photo below.  David Drier and Bill Owens, gov of Colorado (R), refused to say that the current president wasn’t wrong when he decided to sit in the classroom for seven minutes after being informed of the second plane hitting the towers.  This has now become a fifteen minute segment on the show.  And they just keep defending him.  How can you defend this?  It’s utterly indefensible.  Let me see if I can find a picture of the  president in the middle of his moment of “looking strong.”  Now Nader is on Maher as a special guest.  Maher and Moore are going after him a bit.  Nader seems content and firm in his bullshit flawed logic.  And a little nasty in his worldview.   Maher and Moore have both gotten down on their knees and are now begging him.   Bottom line is Bill Maher rules.   I wonder if David Drier is on drugs?  He seems so steadfast in his delusions.
