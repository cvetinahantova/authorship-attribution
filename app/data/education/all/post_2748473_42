Yeah since it has been a while since I have last posted..............  Almost a year has passed and I am desperately hoping and praying for a recovery to its fullest and to feel like myself again. I am learning that things will sometimes take time and I hope that things do not pass me by too much and that people will wait for me. Work is fun most of the time. It has definetly been a source of birth control if i ever get any urges. lol. It just ruins my plans! Gosh!   Question of the Day?   Whats yo man got ta do with me?
