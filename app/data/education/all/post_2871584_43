Today just felt--off.  After having company here for most of the week, my whole schedule was screwed up.  I woke up this morning, ran a few errands, and then came back.  I probably should have done some cleaning and stuff, but I just have no motivation for it.  Instead, I watched some TV, read a little, and now I'm settling in for an evening of SVU.    I've started on a new Stephen King kick.  Right now, I'm working my way through "Different Seasons," which is comprised of some fantastic novellas.  I can go a long time between reading his work, but then when I start rereading it again, I remember just how ingenious he is.  This is good though, because I have a couple of his newer books that I haven't read yet, so now that I'm back in a Stephen King mode, I can work through those ones too.    This weekend should be a nice kick-back weekend.  I want to do some reading, take care of a little cleaning, and do some laundry.  If I get really motivated, I may attempt to install my air conditioner.  Plus, I should probably throw together some samples of the crafts that I'm doing with the kids next week.
