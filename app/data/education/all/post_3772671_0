The Democrats may stage some upsets in Eastern Washington this year. Don Barbieri is running an amazing campaign for the United States House of Representatives. This is the seat that Tom Foley, Democratic Speaker of the House, had for years. When George Nethercutt snatched it away from him, it seemed that it was going to be Republican forever. But now Nethercutt is running against Patty Murray, who is going to trounce him. And Barbieri is charismatic and well financed.  At the more local level, Tom Schmerer is running for the State House. He was running against Dave Mastin, an attractive charismatic fellow who first won as a Democrat and then switched parties. Frankly, Schmerer probably didn't have a chance against Mastin. But then Mastin dropped out, and now Schmerer may have a chance after all
