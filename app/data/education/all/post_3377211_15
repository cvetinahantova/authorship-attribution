Now that my Summer vacation is officially here, I have no idea what to do with my time.  I have too much free time for the next two weeks, as my summer job doesn't start until after July 4th.  Today will be a day spent with videogames, reading (Alice Sebold's  The Lovely Bones  which is awesome), and perhaps a viewing of Kill Bill again on DVD.  See?  My days are as long as they are boring.  This is actually the butt of many jokes with my best friend.  Early on in the year (January-ish), he would call from work, asking me what I did that day.  I would reply that I watched some movie from my DVD collection that he didn't even know existed like  Dark Blue, Holes, Who Framed Roger Rabbit , or some other title that came out of nowhere.  There is hilariousness to be found in these situations.  Sometimes I have to laugh at how much I don't really do on days like this, but I'm learning to appreciate any opportunities that I get to enjoy them.  Sometimes I worry about many of my friends and family at the abundance of work that they do.    Nobody gets any breaks anymore and the work hours get longer and longer.     I know that there are all sorts of people who feel that Americans have too many days off of work as it is, but that's not really my point here.  My point is that we aren't doing enough to actually  relax .  We need more down time.  We need to unwind more often.    Then again, this may just be another naive opinion from a guy whom is unemployed at this point in time.  But I have a feeling that I'll be able to put my money where my mouth is once I do get a job.  Sometimes I just turn work-mode off in order to refuel, and other times I just sit back and watch in awe at the people I know that never stop with their work.  Maybe work is their passion, or maybe it's all that they know.    What I do know right now is that it's 8:53 and I need to play my Xbox while I wait for my phone call regarding my job interview yesterday.     Written on 6/22/04
