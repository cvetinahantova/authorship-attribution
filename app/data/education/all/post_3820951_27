we just brought erika to the UP campus in quezon city for her test schedule today... being there brought back memories to me as when i also took an entrance exam there some 6 years ago...gosh! 6 years ago!!! sounds more like a century ago! actually, i'm the one who's feeling like she's getting old these past days! sigh... erik plans to take up nursing in college...it was funny the way she ws so nervous this morning!even her classmates whom we met up there at the test site was telling her to breath...because she was so fidgety...we all told her to just do her best and whatever happens will be god's willing for her... am at my aunt's room typing this entry with my cousin pia and niece ysa looking over my shoulder...hello!=)
