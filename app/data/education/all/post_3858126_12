So when an ambassador for a country wants you to marry him, he really goes all out there! "I'll build you a school...you can teach and I'll run it for you!" This is a little extreme I feel. I say I'll think about it. Hey, Mauritius is a hot sunny country where there are white beaches and apparantly hotels with bedrooms that have glass floors so you can see the fishes under you. Sounds cool, but I don't want to marry a man older than my own father in order to obtain it! Egypt is one very interesting place where invitations to get married happen frequently.   Today I turned down an invitation to go on a felucca at night. Consider me crazy, but I didn't relish the opportunity to go on a boat at night with nine slightly worse for wear people!! I was very sober and very sensible!  Nothing really crazy happened today. But there was a very memorable meal. I had roast lamb with roast potatoes, beans and carrots, a huge quantity of gravy and... wait for it...MINT SAUCE!! It is the first roast I have had since Christmas. It was delicious! It was so delicious I forgot to leave room for my desired pudding...Apple and Cinnamon Crumble. That would have been perfect. It just means I'll have to go back to that restaurant again!! For readers living in Cairo and desirous of a good roast meal, it is The Nook in Maadi Degla. Street 254. Check it out!!!!!!  Time for sleep now. Must get up later for breakfast - I promised a friend. Good night and sweet dreams!
