OOPS....    I forgot to mention in my last email that yesterday was a fun day at camp. Due to the heat we thought we would do something that was fun and that will keep the students cool. We organized a water ballon game during lunch time. The teachers's and assistants played with the students and others were going around squirting everyone with water guns. The day was really fun. Everyone got all wet and was fresh throughout the rest of the day.    Sunday   I will be going to the lake again with my family. This time we are going to a new lake up the 15 I don't know what it is called. I hope I don't get too sunburned! At night I am going to get together with a friend to make cookies. I am going to their house. We are making home made cookies not out of the store bought dough. I know we are going to have a lot of fun because my friend is really cool.
