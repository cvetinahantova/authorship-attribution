Jane,       This is Michael Cravens from Louisville - I haven't seen you in years! Your dad has been sending me your emails from Thailand. What you're doing is fascinating!  Your last email about showers, squat toilets, and mosquitos made me laugh - because it brought back many memories of my missionary trip for two months to South Korea several years ago.       It sounds beautiful and I'm sure that this will be a great experience for you.       God bless. Write only if you have time. Otherwise, your dad will keep me up to date.       I'll be praying for your safety and a fun experience.       Michael      Mayo2bog <mayo2bog@telepak.net>   wrote:   From: "Mayo2bog"   To: "Michael"   Subject: Fw: no running water Date: Mon, 12 Jul 2004 17:59:11 -0500    ----- Original Message ----- From: Jane Mayo   To:  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;   ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  Sent: Monday, July 12, 2004 7:48 AM Subject: no running water   well hello everyone,  i'm down on koh chang (i've been spelling it wrong) for the next few days. we got here last night and are going to head back friday. anyway... vicky told me that it was a very basic place where we were going to be staying but not many other details. i'm o.k with squat toilets and staying without aircon but i do have a small issue with no where to take a shower. i basically have to stand next to a pool or standing water and use a bucket to rinse myself off. thankfully some of the other people we came down with, christian from new zealand and kee from bangkok, were unwilling to live that way and got a very nice room  right up the beach. THANK GOD! now i can go and have a proper shower when i need one.  other than that i love the place. great music, great food, and friendly people are everywhere. we are staying in a bungalow right on the ocean. the mosquito netting keeps us from being eaten alive while the sounds of the waves crashing against the rocks lulls me to sleep. i absolutely love it here. i might should look into job openings. jk. it's nice for a vacation but i don't think there is much to do here other than lay on the beach and eat good food.  vicky has a digital camera so i'll be sending pics when i get back. this is a promise. well gotta run. hope everyone is enjoying their summer.  love ya, jane  _________________________________________________________________ Get fast, reliable Internet access with MSN 9 Dial-up - now 2 months FREE! http://join.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200361ave/direct/01/       		 Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink New and Improved Yahoo!
