It just came to my attention yesterday that a bunch of people who joined the blog have all this time been eager to post, and yet they couldn't because they couldn't figure out how to do it.   A couple of them actually talked to me about this yesterday, saying they saw the blog and saw where you could leave comments, but they couldn't find where they could post an entry.  Well, it is a little bit tricky, so here's what you guys need to do:  1. Go to  urlLink www.blogger.com .  2. Log-in with the username and password you entered when you created your account (that is, when you received the email inviting you to join this blog).  3. After logging in, you should be taken to a page called the 'Blogger Dashboard'. Here you should be able to view a list of blogs that you are a part of, and one of them should be 'The Pisay 98 Blog'.  4. Click on the 'New Post' icon (the green cross) to write your post.  5. You should be taken to a form that looks similar to an email compose dialog. On the upper right hand portion of the text box, you should see a couple of tabs: 'Edit HTML' and 'Compose'. You could get away with using the 'Edit HTML' options with most simple messages, but if you want to go fancy in your blog and use  different   colors  or even  different   fonts , you could click on the 'Compose' tab to use a WYSIWYG editor.  6. Once you're done writing, preview your post by clicking on the 'Preview' button in the upper right corner of the box. You could get out of the preview mode and continue editing your post by clicking on the 'Hide Preview' button.  7. If you're done writing, it's time to publish your post by clicking on the orange button that says 'Publish Your Post'. You could also save your post as draft and continue writing and publishing it later.  That's it. O, blog na kayo!
