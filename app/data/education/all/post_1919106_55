Good news, it's a suppository!   Except that it isn't. A suppository. But it's good news anyway, because we  finally  managed to get custom kernels to work on the cluster. And my prediction was right, it was one f*cking itty-bitty line that was missing. The trick was that it wasn't a default option in the kernel, so we  had to add it manually . On the bright side, we now learned  a lot  on proper kernel compilation and installation. In a sense, this two-week setback increased the knowledge gap between us and conventional CS students here.  After work, Carol and Amber invited me to Bubba's Icehouse. They have really good pork ribs there... The meat just peels off the bone. And free ice cream is always a bonus.  Lastly, we played Exalted last night. I was exhausted, so I was pushing for an early start/end, but Pat was late, so we didn't start until about 10pm. We did end at around midnight though, so that was ok. I didn't get to do much as far as action is concerned... Most of my time was spent sneaking around and... Umm... Sneaking around.
