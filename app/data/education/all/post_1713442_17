urlLink Academic Exchange Quarterly  I have just accepted the position of Executive Editor at  Academic Exchange Quarterly . I have been a feature editor and associate editor for the journal over the last year and half.  During this time, the journal has a solid record for publishing scholarly articles dealing with teaching in higher education.  Many of these articles have been from librarians.  I hope I will be able to continue the high quality of the journal.  If you or your library does not subscribe, I would encourage you to look over the table of contents page and the sample full-text articles.  I think you will like what you see.  Also, take a look at the different themes we are soliciting articles for right now.  Our acceptance rate hovers under 50% but if you have a good idea and are willing to work with our reviewers you will find this to be an excellent publication to have listed on your vita.
