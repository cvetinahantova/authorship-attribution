Working is for stupid people, plain and simple.  I realize that while it's not very very realistic, I think that everyone should try to pursue a job that either requires the least possible amount of effort from them or one in which so much joy is gotten that the effort spent is worth it.  To this end, I have decided to put forth as little effort as possible to my work in this office.  One can see evidence of this in the very fact that I'm using my time today to write this entry!  What's more, I've often used my time at work to plan vacations and to balance my checkbook.  I will add that my checkbook is the most regularly balanced it's ever been this past year.   I think, though, that if I can just tough it out for one semester, I'll be okay.  I've decided to try to pull everything together to apply for the winter term at Southern Illinois Univeristy - Edwardsville, which I hope will work out.  We'll see.  Until then, I shall bide my time ...   I've never bided (bode?) my time before; it should be fun!
