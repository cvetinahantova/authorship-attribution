I had a dream about Granny.  Only it wasn't what I expected.  I was hoping she would take me for a tour through her heavenly home and gardens.  Instead she decided to drop in on a dream already in progress.  I was walking away from something or someone or maybe I was trying to walk to another place in my dream.  As I was walking, there was Granny standing before me.  Even in my dream I was choked up because I knew that she was dead.  She didn't say anything which was another disappointment.  She stood there beside my brother (yeah, he was in my dream too) smiling.  She wore a familiar red sweatshirt and turtleneck.  She looked as she had looked before the onset of illness, healthy and vibrant.  The way I remember her.  I stood staring at her as though I was staring at a photo.  She just smiled her quiet Mattie smile and continued looking back at me.  All of this must have startled me after a while because I woke up briefly before falling asleep again.  At least, I got to see a glimpse of her.
