i am from gi. Joe, star wars action figures and barbies without heads i am from a 12 year old girl seeing auras and feeling ghosts i am from “yeah buts live in the woods” and “not me” i am from children fighting caller id for freedom  i am from the spirit in the trees, and basketball hoops that talk back i am from no I in team and soccer pride  i am from catholic guilt and feminist fury i am from the beer and cigarette rebellion i am from jacko’s vineyard and million dollar macaroni, in the early days of bare naked ladies  i am from midnight ramblers and merlot bandits, stealing time for art in a heartbeat and riding off into the sunset to be late for my next scheduled appearance  i am from tight brown dresses and learning to salsa on a dirt floor in cork shoes i am secretly from the cell block tango, all of us with skeletons of our own, that, at times, keep us locked away  i am from what’s that funk in the kitchen? And don’t leave the ice tray half empty  i am from the flowers of flower children, from wordsworth’s plight and emerson’s serenity i am from a generation of activists, searching for a cause and looking inward.  i am from the hearts of folksingers passing out peace and love lollipops on street corners and in cafes, baptizing us with the sunshine in front of our eyes  i am from a conscripted vietnam vet, who grieves janis joplin like a sister i am from the unique strength of Her, a giver of second chances, always seeing the good, and praying it will come i am from goddesses who shall mother the world all over again with careful and deliberate hands  i am from the pain of my sisters as we move on, together, stitching and patching each other, lending hands and shoulders, and handing out hope chocolate to keep on keepin on  i am from ayjadamunjba, and other grandmother slang i am from turning the other cheek and psychology  i am from church choirs, jesus lovers, birth controllers and controversies i am from kick boxing for my life  i am from two landmarks and a roomful of rocks i am from all of the pieces of all the hearts that I touch and love and savor on my way
