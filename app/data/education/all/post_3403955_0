I know what I want and I am waiting for it. In the meantime I trying to be content. I am truly blessed and have a full life. But inside there is an ache a longing and I am trying to make it go away but it just wants to stay. I have this passion and desire to find that person who compliments me and who I am compliment in the best way. A man to support and care for. Someone who will think I am full of grace and beauty.Someone who will cause me to laugh and smile ( not that difficult, I laugh at the drop of a hat!) Someone who will help me find contentment.........or do I have to find my contentment first?
