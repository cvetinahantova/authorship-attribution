Aside from that uber-bizarre episode with Tony's layered dreams, this entire season was most excellent. The FBI's active involvement contributes ample suspense to the chaotic lives of the families within the show. Since next season is the show's final one, it saddens me to think that Tony Soprano will either end up dead or in jail by the end of next season. He tries to act justly in a criminal underworld and abide by its rule of law. Yet, he is in embattled in a living nightmare with no clear escape route. I would love for Tony to avoid both stateside arrest and international extradition and live a wonderful life, but realize the writers will probably choose a different outcome. The show has strong moral overtones and will likely reconcile its closing content with a traditional value/criminal justice system.
