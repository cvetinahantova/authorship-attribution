Another Job well done. Completed SAJS camp today. I was assigned to be the rockclimbing instructor today after rotating from the abseil tower yesterday. On some occasion i need to give the kids a little "help" in climbing by literally hoisting them up with the rope. It was very satisfying by seeing the kids complete the climb with my little help.   Went for lunch with the OC instructors at Beach road and found that they are actually a very friendly bunch. Coincidentally, some are my current and some former school mates. Some were from NUS and another girl was actually my junior in YJC. Till next camp in july, i shall now be a slacker again.   By they way if you have not spoke to me on MSN these few days, I have trimmed down by almost 4 kg after 2 days of kayaking. Me now 73kg....might be even lower cos i was wearing shoes and harness when i weigh myself...furthermore there is a zero error in the scale cos it starts before 0kg...heehee  Though weight cut...need to start training fitness and my stomach liao ....hahaha.....looks like beer belly liao ...  cheerios Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
