sometimes i wish i had never moved in with the boys because then maybe things wouldn't be so screwed up between us.  i was such good friends with them.  now i just feel like everything we have is rapidly disintegrating.  they did give me a hug tonight to say goodbye for christmas since they probably won't be up tomorrow before i leave.  that felt good.  none of them have hugged me lately...in fact none of them have even gotten within touching distance of me.     i'm sort of sad that i'm going to be spending new year's "alone" and by "alone" i mean the guys are going to be preoccupied with their "girlfriends"...and will probably end up locking themselves in their rooms with them...and i won't have anyone to even talk to that night.  i guess there is a possibility that i'll be going to a party that one of my colleaques is throwing.  he's looking into possible date setups for me, which is cool.  i'm not sure i actually want to have a boyfriend...ever....but i suppose going out on a few dates, meeting new people, and having fun isn't bad.  i am just really at a point in my life when i don't think i need anyone and i've realized that it's more hassle and unnecessary pressure to be with someone when you don't get all that much out.  not saying this is always the case, and maybe it's different if the other person actually loves you.  unfortunately i haven't been that lucky yet...i don't think any of the guys i have dated really saw me as more than an object and none of them loved me.  i keep dreaming that i'll find someone that thinks the world of me and truly wants to be with me.  i'm certainly not holding my breath though.  and like i said before, i'm perfectly alright with being alone forever.  i'm strong...
