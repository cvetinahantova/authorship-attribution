Someone out there is having the best day of their lives... someone is falling in love, someone is crying because they're so happy, someone is having sex, someone is having a baby, someone is starting their first day on the job, someone is learning how to play an instrument, someone is moving away from home, someone is making a new best friend, someone is having their first kiss...   Someone is doing something they'll always remember...   Someone is reading this blog (I'm sure THAT'S something you'll always remember!)    Are you doing something worth remembering today???        (This moment of inspriational blogging is brought to you by a lack of sleep and a gloriously beautiful day! {or in the words of Zoolander: A really, really, really, ridiculously good looking day})
