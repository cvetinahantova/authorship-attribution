Jennifer has given me some gerontology articles, one of which seems quite similar (too similar?!) to our survey data.  They surveyed college students (100% Intenet users) and people from senior citizen centers (18% Internet users) and found some interesting results:   There was no difference b/t younger and older Internet users in terms of time spent using Internet per week.  Older internet users and non-users differed on one of the five personality factors (intellect/openness) and all demographic characteristics (younger, higher incomes, more education, better health).  Most interestingly, "older Internet users and non-users differed in a similar fashion as young and older adults did in two dimensions of psychological well-being.  Older Internet users scored higher than non-users on personal growth and purpose in life.  Similarly, young adults rated themselves higher than older adults on those two dimensions.  In a sense, older Internet users were more like young adults than non-users" (p. 741).   What occurred to me is that perhaps we need to conduct our survey with 250 younger people for comparison purposes (Mary, remember Port's comments at my presentation?).  Two alternatives are to 1) collect data from college students this fall, or 2) have IDC collect telephone data for us.  If #2, I can try to get money from CRITO and/or use my discretionary money.  I can't figure out how to attached a pdf of the Chen and Persson (2002) article I'm referencing above, so I'll email it to you both.
