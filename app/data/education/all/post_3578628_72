I was sitting here thinking.  I do that often.  And I made a connection between two events that have happened.  I was reminded of something my elementary teacher taught me called cause and effect.  When one thing happens, another thing happens in response to it.  It's hard to pinpoint situations like that in the world, but I believe I have found one.  And because I have, it's only right that an apology is issued to family of the hostage currently being held at gunpoint.  You see, the al-Qaeda man with the gun said, "We have our legal right to treat [hostages] the same way they treat our people," he added. "We will publish more details about the man kidnapped and explain the mujahedeen's demands."  If anyone cares, the mujahedeen are a group of Islamic militants.  That being said...  Dear To Whom It May Concern,  I have had little to no sleep over the past month due to the horrid crime I committed in the prison.  It was only complicated when I heard of the disaster that your family became a part of.  I recognized that man's interrogation technique because I used that exact same harsh manner with a man who was a terrorist.  I can only imagine what you are thinking with all of the video and news coverage that is going on.  I have experience so I can only imagine that he is not being allowed to sleep, eat, or relax in any way, not to mention it's tough when being held at gunpoint.  I have realized the consequence that my actions have had on your family. Had I not taken pictures and played foolish games with the prisoners, Paul may have still been safe in Saudi Arabia.  No matter what, my heart goes out to you.    Sincerely,  The Anonymous Rough Interrogator Writing From Inside a Prison  God bless.
