Eric had surgery last night, to remove the thing from his eye.  It was one of those orange flags that surveyors use to mark with.  He will have to ahve surgery again in 2 weeks, and has lost approximatly 40% of the vision in that eye.  They are watching the eye very closely for infection, or he  could lose the eye.    Post more later, have to run and errand.
