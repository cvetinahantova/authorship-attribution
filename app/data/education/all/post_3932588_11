Hi Everyone,          My name is Suzanne Scott, and I was with all of you this morning, I have to admit that I was alittle apprehensive, I am somewhat of a loner and the idea of running with 40+ women wasn't something I thought I would enjoy....You all changed that for me and I want to  Thank You....         This is going to be an incredible adventure...we will all benefit in more ways than we could have ever imagined.        We have to thank Mary Kay, Wendy, Debra, and Bonnie for taking on a project like this and giving of themselves and their time for all of us...        My very Special Love and Appreciation for my "Soul Sister" Mary Kay...you know I Love You very much.        Oh yeah, I am a massage therapist and in the very near future will set-up my table after long runs for anyone who will love to get alittle work done, legs, neck, back, shoulders....and if there are any other massage people in our group, let's work together..
