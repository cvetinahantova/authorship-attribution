dude, i wonder if the grammar's any good up there... i'm missing a few accents, but that title *should* be "happy st. nicolas day!" in hungarian =)  indeed.  i wish i lived somewhere a little closer to my friends here... every year of college, my friend nicole would remind us to leave our shoes outside our doors for st. nick's day and she'd leave candy for us and a note.  it was really cute and i always looked forward to it.  last year, i was actually in hungary over st. nick's day and what i thought was the most awesome thing ever was how they celebrated.  here in the US st. nick's day is kinda lost and the whole season from thanksgiving through christmas is shopping-mania and commercial the whole way though.  in other places, and in my experience in hungary in particular, the commercial stuff w/ santa and all happens for st. nick's day on the 6th, and then christmas is kept sacred for jesus coming... no santa, since he's been out of the picture for nearly 3 weeks by then!  that was the coolest ever.   all this is to say, happy st. nick's day to you all.  i'm missing being able to do anything fun for it as i just have my one roommate, and pretty sure she'd be more confused by me than she already is if i told her she should leave her shoes outside her door before she goes to sleep. =P... and as usual, i miss nicole -- she was the coolest ever indeed. =P  ok, so on a less serious note, here's another chance to get points. =P tell me what the following means (if you're clever this shouldn't be hard) part A gets you 1 point, part B gets you 2, for a grand total of up to 3 points =P  (A) 03755, 08854, 08857, 15203, 15239, 16023, 19027, 19428, 21061, 27514, 29203, 29720, 32940, 33957, 38002, 38018, 38028, 38115, 38117, 38119, 38122, 38128, 38134, 38135, 38138, 38141, 38671, 43402, 43512, 45056, 46113, 46167, 46303, 46319, 46349, 46383, 46816, 49008, 50012, 53565, 55057, 55407, 55427, 55444, 60160, 60187, 60193, 60195, 60423, 60477, 60544, 60546, 60657, 60950, 60955, 63105, 77566, 80526, 82001, 84106, 97007, 97203, 98177  (B) 1033, 1035, 1063, 1134, 1525, 8110, 50100  good luck, and good night =P
