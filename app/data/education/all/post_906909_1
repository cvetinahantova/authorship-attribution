I've been diligently reading the postings on instructional design, particular the concept maps and gawd am I confused. Concept maps seem a tad bewildering but it's likely due to my lack of exposure to it. Am toying with the concepts and trying to frame my scattered thoughts on instructional design and hope to have it posted soon. Wish me luck!
