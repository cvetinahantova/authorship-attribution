Bar·ce·lo·na    Pronunciation Key  (bäçe-lºna)  A city of northeast Spain on the Mediterranean Sea. Founded by the Carthaginians, it prospered under the Romans and Visigoths, fell to the Moors in 713, and was taken by Charlemagne's Frankish troops in 801. It has long been a center of Catalan separatism and radical political movements. Population: 1,770,296.  Or if you are a local it is pronounced barthelona, accompanied with a thich warm accent. The slums of this city denounce the place to be of less wealth than it is. Thought the streets are not as clean as those in Paris, the full of the rich aroma of life and character. Buskers, beggars and theives walk here, and saw all within my first hour of being let loose on the streets. Though I was a target for none, it was interesting to see the salt-of-the-earth perform here. The bands on the street are amazing, I could not get over how much more alive the music sounds. It is though the very essence of the musicians are eminating from the instruments they caress.  I must sign off quickly now, the bus is coming I think and I need to go and check. ciao for now.
