I just returned from a quick trip to the beach with my friend Nikki. Each year Nikki, Leana, and I go to the beach but this year Leana had to stay home for graduate classes. This was the 3rd year of our annual beach trip. The first year we stayed in  urlLink Seagrove Beach , the 2nd year we stayed at a cute cabin in  urlLink Seaside Beach , and this year we stayed at  urlLink The Inn at Gulf Place  in  urlLink Santa Rosa Beach . We had a great time...it was very relaxing.   We went to some of our ususal stops:  urlLink Zoo Gallery ,  urlLink Red Bar , and  urlLink Fudpuckers .  A few new places we checked out were:  urlLink Miss Lucille's Gossip Parlor  and  urlLink The Artists of Gulf Place .  So now I am back home to write papers for grad school...let the fun begin!
