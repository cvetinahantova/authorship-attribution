Ever seen a motorcycle drive into a house? I have. Billy crashed his motorcycle into The Manor. He smashed through a door and did wheelies around the living room. Not quite, but wood and glass were exciled to the nether regions of the house in any case. It was really impressive. He revved up and tore right into the side of the house. Wham! Crash! Smash! Splendid. That reckless device, spewing fumes into the atomosphere, merged with the pine, glass and metal for one brief instant. Ah, and a glorious instant it was, however brief. Though as we see in the prologue, all good things must come to and end. And they did. In the form of the moto deciding to discontinue its journey through the woodwork and stall, wedged in the frame. That gets the adrenaline pumping. Billy should probably give  urlLink these guys   a call.       This is a picture of us after he drove the bike into the house.      This is Sylvia      Here's Lola.   I am flying home on the 3rd of October. Good times.
