They get they ass knocked out. Mike Tyson, formerly known as the baddest man alive,  urlLink was put down for the count by unheralded heaveweight Danny Williams earlier tonight . This brings the end to Mr. Tyson's career that is vastly overrated by almost everyone. The only name fighter he defeated was Larry Holmes and he was well past his prime when he fought Tyson.  The only way Mike can even imagine to get out his  urlLink $38,000,000 debt  would be to A) fight Tonya Harding in Celebrity Boxing III, IV, V, VI, and VII or B) hope and pray that Jimmy Kimmel will make him a lifetime co-host. Sadly, the more likely option is A.
