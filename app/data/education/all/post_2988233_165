I may or may not have some good news.  My oldest sister, who is in the process of seperating with her husband, may move in with our parents.  That would be a huge help, to mom and dad, but might cause tension as well.    My sis and my mom get on each other's nerves and are both very set in their ways.  That is putting it mildly.  I hope it owrks, I know it would relieve dad a lot, and I wouldn't have to worry about them so much at night.  We'll see.
