Would you believe it Aaron! I finally made it on to this site.  So here goes... what have I been up to?  I am living in East London, Seven Kings, Essex and I am teaching at a school in Emerson Park which is further out of London.  Well most of you probably know that anyway.  The house I am living in is a Typical 4 bedroom house which is joined to another house on both sides.  The street looks kind of similar to the Street on the closing of Coronation Street.  From here it is pretty easy to get anywhere as less than two minutes walk away is the Seven Kings train station.  From there it takes half an hour to get into central London through either  the Liverpool Street or Stratford stations.  To get to work I catch a train to Romford and change to another that heads to Upminster via Emerson Park, I then have to walk 20mins before I arrive at school, good for my fitness, but I miss my car! One hour to get to a place that would take about twenty minutes to drive is ridiculous! Anyway, school is getting better, slowly, as I train the students to the behaviour that I expect in my classroom.  It is taking extra long as most of the other teachers do not expect anywhere near the same behaviour as I do!  I have heard some awful teaching, I heard one teacher telling his class to SHUT UP over and over again, and this teacher has been there all year! Surprisingly enough the  Last Friday we had the Annual Athletics day that I looked forward to all week only to be left supervising a couple of hundred bored students on the outside of the running track where they could see nothing and they were not allowed to move!  No house colours or spirit anywhere to be seen.  It was also bloody cold and windy which did not help at all, definately the most bored I have been for a long long time.  Oh well, at least I will get paid for it.    At present I am planning a trip to Italy to meet up with my Aunt, Uncle and my cuzzies at the end of July.  I will leave here on the 25 and return on the 30.  Will be nice to get back to Italy, and since my cousin is right into all the history it should be very informative also.  This means that I do have to work for the last week of this term that I really wanted to avoid.  But shit happens.  ï¿½400 is a fair bit to brush off.  Then I will be moving out of my flat :( and moving back to Lydia's before we head off to Ireland and then on to Scotland!  We are going to do a road trip which should be a heap of fun and hopefully a little cheaper than a tour.  It will be nice chosing what we do and when.  I am not sure at the moment how long this trip will be for but I spose it doesn't really matter.  While in Scotland I hope to catch up with Cara(a Kiwi girl I met on Contiki) and I might even be lucky enough to stay with her for a while.  Then back to Lydia's in Reading and then I would like to cruise down to Cornwall for a week and catch up with a girl from there I met in NZ.  And IF I haven't seen enough already I want to go see a few castles, which is the only thing I haven't seen yet!!  Then.....yeah I know another then but then I will be heading home on the 16 or 17 or 18 of september.  I cant really remember when.  Really looking forward to getting back although I know not much would have changed except I would have missed out on Winter.  I have been siting outside today in my bikini sunbathing and reading!  It was lovely!  Well hope that was OK I know it doesn't measure up to Aaron's standard but it will do!  Cheers Everyone
