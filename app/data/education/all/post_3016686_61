Jessica Simpson's metrosexual father speaking to  Vanity Fa ir about her appeal:   “Yes, she is beautiful. Yes, she can sing. But they are not in love with her boobs.  They are not in love with her hair. Those things are secondary. America has fallen in love with an imperfect girl who has gas, who stumbles, who makes mistakes.  And for the first time they are hearing her sing through new glasses – through the eyes of ‘I love her heart.’”
