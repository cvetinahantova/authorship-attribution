just before midnight on halloween night, i was walking across the parking lot in Marietta Ohio bringing two styrofoam cups of orange juice to Bemis & Scott Bell, noticing how the half moon had grown large and looked like an overripe precarious bit of orange fruit, about to fall off an overtaxed and invisible branch down toward the blue steel bridge which would definitely shatter into a hundred shards into the Ohio River.  Just then a very small, completely black kitten ran across the parking lot and the cement sidewalk.  There was no turning back.  If I were to go to my hotel room at all, ever that night, I would have to stay on the path which had now been crossed by a small black cat.    But what is the significance of a black Kitten crossing your path?  Certainly not seven years of bad luck? The very kittenness of the cat must either reverse the effects making it seven years of good luck or make the badluck stick for life.    Asian beetles are flying into my office window, but I'm not going to close it.  The day is just too beautiful and the mobile Greg Snell & Bev Matiko made for me is whirling in this delightful slow arc over my green metal 1960-something Steelcase desk.  It makes grading these persuasion papers a great deal more tolerable.    Have I ever mentioned on this blog that I hate grading?    That and drop ceilings.  ~Peace.
