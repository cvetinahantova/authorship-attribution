Today, an NPR story about former Mujahideen warlords who have remained armed and in power due to coalition incompetence or impotence.  The latest rumor asserts that they will pull together to forward their own candidate for Afghanistan's upcoming elections.    It isn't unsuprising that power stays in place unless deposed.  The ideology of democracy seems to suggest that wise intervention deposes corrupt old regimes for new.   Yet American experiments in tinkering with alternate powers have gone awry in South America and Haiti.  Afghanistan seems to be a first experiment with another way: leaving the old power in place.  But the situation seems to indicate wishful thinking on America's part.  Will Afghani warlords really just go away after generations of intimidating their own?  Aren't their alliances too set?  Even if we deposed a few, wouldn't the same power structures generate new heads, like a hydra?    About a decade or more ago, students of colonialism used to encounter the dread "Cambridge School" of Indian history.  The Cambridge School historians attempted to show how British rule had  cultivated relationships with the Indian elite, many of whom were willing collaborators.  The British, after all, didn't announce "democracy" immediately and hand the country over to whatever alliances formed naturally.  Nor did they try to engineer a new ruling class out of thin air.  It is a model of sorts.    The Cambridge School is now among the great effigies trashed on a regular basis among colonial historians.  Their work rings is too sceptical of Indian nationalism.  It gives too little credit to rank-and-file organization.    But neither the courage of the masses nor the idealism of the historian can alter the existence of elites.
