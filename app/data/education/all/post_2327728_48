Someone asked about the mac mommy moniker, so I thought I'd take a minute to explain.  I am a  urlLink Mac -convert of the worst kind.  I am like one of those ex-smokers who feels holier-than-thou, and complains bitterly about public smokers, but with PCs.  When I got to my current lab, everyone was on Mac.  I made the switch, and never looked back.  Macs are the greatest creation in history, and if you aren't on a mac now, you will be in 10 years.  That's how long I predict it is going to take stubborn PC users to realize that better media, no viruses, superior programs, and a more intelligent, intuitive operating system are worth the growing pains of having to make a change.  It took me 2 months to fall in love.  And of course, there is the take-off of "mack daddy" (see definition  urlLink here ).  BTW - I tend to post on the same day because I am saving up.  I don't have a connection at home, so I write on weekends, or in the evening on my MAC ibook, and post all at once.  I don't write continuously (well, I do sort of, but it's scientific crap, so I don't post it).
