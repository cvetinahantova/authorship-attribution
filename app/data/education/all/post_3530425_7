I was at a picnic last night that Transition Man was invited to also.  Buffy's right (if not exactly complimentary), he makes me neurotic.  And it's nothing he does:  it's all me.  I've been obsessing ever since, although my obsession no longer sounds like, "how can I make him love me," but "here's what I want to tell him."  So, here's what I want to tell him:  He's beautiful, inside and out.  He's good at everything he does:  music, teaching, cooking, making love.  People really love him, in a full out way.  And I deserve better.  I deserve someone who will recognize the same qualities in me, not just someone who thinks I'm a good lay.  As Ames commented, I am remarkable.  If he could recognize that, we'd make an amazing team.  But he doesn't, and probably won't, so I can't go there.  I'm cancelling our movie date.  Without my usual, long-winded explanation.  Not that he'd want to hear it anyway.
