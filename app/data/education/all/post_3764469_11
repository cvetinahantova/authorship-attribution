today i took time off from my hectic schedule to attend the christening of aissa's baby boy chase. you can tell that little guy is gonna be somebody because the Lord of Darkness himself decides to show up.         i was referring to the guy on the right, with the pecs. jinko, not me you lamers.   anyway, i was struck by how few of us actually decided to come. the four girls, jonas, jaemark, jinko, me. what is even more disturbing is the primary reason for not being able to come - work.   look guys: here we are, all of us about 20-25 years old, most are now working their butts off, some deciding to stay in school. in five years - heck, in a couple of years we'd be ready to start our own nest. and with a family comes more work and less time off for ourselves. the next few years will be spent juggling the pressures of work, kids, the wife, husband, other woman, other man, etc. and then we wake up, it's homecoming night, and think,  "shit, i haven't seen my friends in a long time. ano na nga ba itsura ng mga yun?"  if we can't be there for our friends now when the rat race is still manageable, can we be there for them when the race becomes really tough?   are my priorities really that far off the mark? sure, i gotta work to get money. sure, i have to be well off so that my kids won't end up eating pancit canton or fried rice / ketchup for the rest of their lives. i understand that, at least. but we are still young, dammit, opportunity knocks a hell of a lot of times(we just don't listen well enough), and our friends won't be there forever. in the great cycle of life, a day of absence at (insert company here) is a small speck of dust compared to the time you spend in the presence of those you hold dear.   in the words of stephen king:  all that you love will be carried away .       would you stay and watch them go, or will you do something about it?
