I thought that speech by Kerry was very good.  I heard it through my sleep.  The polls are in Kerry's favor now, but wait the GOP will be all over my city, (NYC that is), I will be hiding in my room.  It amazes me how no one concentrates on Bush and his lies, but we have to talk about Kerry's wife's comments, "shove it!"  You know what?  A lot of people should.  People from Fox News should start first.  I like a first lady who knows more than to shake her head at the right moments.  This one at least knows more than one language.  And no one should comment on Kerry and his money.  How much money does Bush have?  Even Ron Regan is going to the "other side."  He's probably trying to make up for the horror of a mess his father made during the early years of the AIDS crisis.  I just can't wait for the debate between Kerry and Bush.  No, Edwards and Cheney!  That should be better!  I don't care if Kerry "flip-flops."  Like he said, nothing is black and white and think about what Bush did to all of the servicemen in this country.  Ok, you all know I'm liberal.  You have to be if you're gay.  The Log Cabin republicans?  Don't make me laugh.  Single Issues, shut up.  SIGH.  ANYWAY, today I will wash my little dog Pipa, my teacup poodle and probably watch "City of God."  I will watch Guiding Light and find out why Dinah came back into town and if Harley breaks the wedding off with Gus, most likely so.  What?  So I watch soaps.  It fills my days when I don't want to think.  Now I must be off, my dog is chewing on a razor that someone dropped.  Unless she wants to shave her tounge, it isn't a good idea.
