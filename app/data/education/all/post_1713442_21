urlLink Librarian Avengers: Why you should fall to your knees and worship a librarian  Many of you are probably aware of Erica Olsen's Librarian Avengers site.  In particular, that great page that explains why librarians should be worshipped.  (Alas, my wife still ain't buying it.)  The url has been changed though.  The old Librarian Avengers domain (librarianavengers.com) was hijacked when Erica failed to renew in time.  It happens.  Please don't visit the old site as I don't want to help those parasites get any traffic.  Anyway, she is back up at librarianavengers.org.  Please go and give the site a visit.  (And this situation set a fire under my feet.  I have registered LibraryInstruction.Com through 2012!)
