Many people will come and go in your life But some will make a lasting impression I'm lucky to have met someone like you Full of so much warmth and real compassion  A great distance may separate you from me Yet at times I feel like you're so close Not just lines on a screen or a voice I hear Like flesh and blood I can feel and touch  I feel so calm and peaceful with you around Most times making it the best part of my day  If memories are all that we leave behind in life Then you have already left many to cherish I look forward to the many days that lay ahead The good times we share and were destiny may take us  Thank you so much Ian! xoxo
