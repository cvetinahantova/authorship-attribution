I spent a little time this afternoon getting some stuff for school this year.  Mostly clothes and shoes.  Got a sturdy and comfortable pair of shoes from Brown's Shoe Fit in Fort Collins.  If I am going to be on my feet for 8 hours a day, I have to have comfortable shoes.  I also went by Savers to get some clothes.  I have some dress business clothes, but little in the way of more casual slacks and shirts.  Savers was recommended by a number of people in our cohort as *the* place to get cheap clothes.  They were right.  Savers is a thrift store, so everything is used, but the clothes offered were mostly in very good condition.  Used clothes, you say?  Well, yeah.  I am a full time student without a paying job, I need cheap clothes!  I got two nice pairs of Dockers for about 5.00 each, as well as 5 Polo shirts and 4 short sleeve casual shirts.  Spent 40.00 altogether.
