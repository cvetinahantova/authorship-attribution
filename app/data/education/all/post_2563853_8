I haven't been able to post for such a while due to my webhost.  The ftp services are down even still.  Something is going to have to be done.  Oh well, I have switched to another host for this blog and plan to start to post a lot more.  Well anyway that is the reason for what was going on.  Also I have registered  urlLink http://www.drewtown.com/   that will link you to my home page.  You can email me at  urlLink andrewflanery@gmail.com .  Sometimes and more likely within the next 2 weeks to site could be shakey.  So if it isn't working just try again later.  Thanks again for all your support.
