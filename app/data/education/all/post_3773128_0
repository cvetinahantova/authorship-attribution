We were suppose to have Maths class this afternoon,but due to the Minggu Kualiti INTEC, our lecturer was busy, so she only drop in for a few minutes. So, again we have the whole afternoon free.        Was in the library just now doing the homework that I didn't touch for a week.     And it so happened that I came across 4 Lat's comic, so I borrowed all of it back. I never thought that a library would have collection of Lat's comic. Hopefully I won't be too indulge in it till I neglect all my homework.     Was trying to memorize the song that Q1 SonSengNim gave us yesterday, but it just didn't seem to sink into my mind. I better find a way to memorize it by next Tuesday or else I might be in deep trouble : (     Wanted to use the computer in the lab, but surprisingly the internet was not working in the campus. So had to come to a cyber cafe...not sure how long I can keep up with this    If JPA doesn't give us our allowance within the next 3 weeks I'll probably starve to death :(
