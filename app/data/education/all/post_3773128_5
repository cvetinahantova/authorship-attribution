We watched "Classic" , another Korean movie this afternoon. Still, we wouldn't be able to understand the story without the sub-title. I wonder how long would it take before we can watch a Korean movie without sub-titles.       2 of our seniors came back from Korea and we had some time to satisfy more of our curiosity about life as a foreign student in Korea.  It seems that our seniors had quite a good time over there.      Learning a new language and culture is fun, if I don't need to depend on it to survive. But still, I think I'll manage to pull through, with God's help of course.           I'm planning to stay in the hostel during my first year in Korea, a thing which none of our seniors did before (not that they didn't want, but they didn't have no choice). Our seniors only moved into hostel after completing their one and a half years' language course.      Thus, we do not have any info concerning life in Seoul National University's hostel as a freshman.      My reason for staying in the hostel is:  firstly,  I'll meet more people from other countries and I'll have more time to socialize with them.      Secondly, it'll be more convenient to join activities held in the university, since the distance between the hostel and university is nearer.      Lastly, I have the intention of going to Seoul National University to pursue my degree. I want to see how's the life, attitude and character of the students studying in the university first-hand.     However, I'll talk this out with Jang SonSengNim before I make my decision.
