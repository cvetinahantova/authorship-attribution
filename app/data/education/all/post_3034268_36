Goodbye, Northern Student   I have just quit writing for the Northern Student.  The primary reason is lack of time, but the catalystic event occured somewhere in between being denied a "Philosophy Column," due to a lack of space, where I would try to write articles that would stimulate the minds of my fellow students, and then being assigned an article about the guy who ate a two pound, nine ounce burger at Bar 209.
