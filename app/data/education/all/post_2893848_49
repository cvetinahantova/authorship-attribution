This morning I finished Middlemarch, and man oh man was I not disappointed.  How much did I want Dorothea and Lydgate to be real people?  This much.  (Imagine a gesture indicative of vast hugeness.)  Good God, I was so deeply moved so often that I find it hard to talk about.  5 stars from this reviewer.  It's a book about idealisim, ultimately, I think.  Why it is dangerous and necessary and problematic, etc.  Does a good job of undercutting (and sometimes fulfilling) romantic expectations to that end.  It was just so complex and real, despite the stuffy strangeness of that world.  Anyway, enough about that.  I started Breece Pancake's collection this afternoon.  I thought Jim's introduction was very good.  I also just watched The Barbarian Invasions, which I liked a lot.  Made me cry, but I'm a sucker.  And a question--how is one supposed to care for copper pots?  Anybody?  (Chang?)  D and I were given a set at her bridal shower.  They're copper outside, stainless inside, with an aluminum core.  I've gotten them all spotty already, and D left one on a hot burner, which caused the copper to sort of blister.  Is that normal?  I'll leave you all with one of my favorite lines from Middlemarch (from p. 686, in the Finale):  "He once called her his basil plant; and when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man's brains."  Anyway, it's much more devastating in context.  PS--Our basil is doing very well, thankyou.
