I finally got my Eagle Scout Project turned in. Now I have a Board of Review and I will be an Eagle Scout. (If I pass). I was just working on my chair that I am making from broken skateboards. My basement is covered in them.  I love life.  Everybody check out www.straylightrun.com . Good stuff, but very emo. lol. Love ya guys!
