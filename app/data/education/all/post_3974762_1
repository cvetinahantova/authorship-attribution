Future topics I'd like to address but can't right now...  Casual talk vs. building meaningful relationships through conversation  What the deal with the iPod?  Its okay tune in and drop out of interacting with anyone but a little machine but homeschoolers aren't properly 'socialized' because they aren't walking the halls in line with others their age?
