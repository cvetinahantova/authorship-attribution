Today is cooling with the Rain of the Month falling...  Yes!!! I've taken the first step towards regaining fitness. Though it rained the whole afternoon. The night was cooling to run and excercise. I went thru THIS!!!  1) Ran 2 km 2) 20 crunches 3) 10 side crunches on each side 4) 20 sets of step up excercises on the concrete benches under the flat. 5) Walked up the stairs on the way home instead of taking the lifts. 6) Tried doing leg raisers....cannot back too pain liao ...  Though this cannot be considered streneous but it is a good start. Now my head is getting giddy liao ......too long neber excercise liao... YUANYEE!!!! KEep it going tomolo!!! I will not go through the route of going on a "HEALTHY" diet to trim down. What's life without enjoying all the good food around me? I am doing our ancestors a big disfavour by not enjoying all the food they came up with. Just got to watch my diet, but not to the extreme.   Now is the sad event of the day. I've called the manager who offered me an interview. To my dismay, the job vacancy he offered does not suit me....or i should say i dont suit the job cos it requires technical skills. Neber mind, he will look out for other vacancies for me. In the meantime , just got to look for other jobs lor.  Tomolo going kayaking loh!!! The toopid woman raine changed the morning session to afternoon...well, its even better....now i get to sleep more.  Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
