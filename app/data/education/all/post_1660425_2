As I read through the article, Teaching in the wireless cloud, I thought about what emerging technology means for me as a classroom teacher.  I can see the benefits of using wireless connections in the classroom for research, discussion, and interaction.  I think it can be a powerful educational tool....so long as its used in an appropriate manner and is monitored.  Students already use cell phones to text message their friends in class.  Cell phones are just the beginning.  As students begin to get deeper and deeper into technology, schools will continually have to adpat.  They will have to learn to use technology to their advantage.  I think college and universities are a wonderful place to use wireless technology in the classroom...I think use of these technologies in the public school classroom are a long way away.  The resources (technology and financial) are limited in public school education.  In order to acheive such an undertaking, a teacher would have to receive a grant in order to fund and provide for such a project.
