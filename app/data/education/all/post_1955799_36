I'm in a funk again.  It's because I need some rest.  LOL.  I'm tired.  Completed most of my project for my web design class.  There's a student in my class that always asks me questions.  She's a little too much, and she doesn't seem to grasp a thing we've learned.  I can't help her much, even though she thinks I'm like efficent in the class.  I'm like I'm reading the same book as you, and all I ever do to remember my steps is go over the pratice exercise.  LOL.  I guess she doesn't want to go that route.    I like the progress I'm making, and I need to feel that way about my photoshop class.  I kinda hated that last project.  I got fustrated, and upset.  I turned in what I had, but I don't know if that is good enough.  That makes me feel sad.  maybe I wasn't going to learn ALL of the material, but the majority of it.  Classses are tough sometimes.  I do want to rest my nerves, and go to sleep.  I forgot Law and Order now comes on Tuesdays, so I'm missing that.  Life's full of twists.
