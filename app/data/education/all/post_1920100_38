Hey  I hope everyone is doing well. It seems like forever since I last wrote on my blog. Well this week has been a little hectick for me. I have been home alone for the whole week and at times it is hard. I've been praying a lot though. My parents went on vacation which is a  big blessing because my dad never takes time off from work. I hope God protects them and gives them time to rest.  Yesterday was a productive day. I went to help some friends move, then I went to visit my bro had dinner with them and drove to bible study. I was debating whether not to go I didn't get to my brother's house until like 4:30p and I would have had to leave by 7:00p to make it to bible study at 7:30 and I felt like it was too little of a time to spend with them and I didn't want to be rude. Anyhow I was there and we had dinner at 7p when my bro got home from work. I was like I can't leave now I haven't seen my bro and I didn't want to be rude and leave. So I stuck around. I was playing with the kids and helping them feed them. It was so cool to entertain them and see the joy in their eyes and see their smiles. Finally it was 8p and I was like I have to go home. I headed out at 8p and I was like it's too late to show up to bible study but I had an urge to go. (I think it was the devil keeping me from hearing God's word). I ended up showing up to bible study like at 8:30p. It was cool because they were talking about relationships. Later on everyone decided to go hang out at starbucks. I had so much fun. Although the coffee was not good ( I don't know why) fellowship was great.It was like a group of 20 that ended up going and we were just talking and laughing and sharing. I thank God for blessing me with this church and with these people.  I am really praying for direction from God regarding church and being commited. Thanks for all those of  you who have been praying and ecouraging me.
