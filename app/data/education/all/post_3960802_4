I have just about had it with Freewebs.  I think they've gone on vacation and let their host website business disintegrate.  So now I'm shopping for a new, more reliable web host.  I don't know if this will work.   A Blogging site isn't what I had in mind, but none of the other sites seem to fit my purposes like freewebs did, so I guess I just start in.    urlLink http://flickr.com/photos/88303_48600090482@N01_m.jpg
