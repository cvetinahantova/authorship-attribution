Today, a Tuesday that feels like a monday and I am sitting here writing in my blog putting off the things I should do. Not that they can't wait but why put off for tomorrow what you can accompish today? It seems that this town has this hold over me. It slows the speed of life. It slows my desire to do much of anything. I sit and ponder and think about all that goes on and all who interact with me. WHat is their purpose in my life? What is mine in theirs? I know that I am put here for a reason and that everyday I have the oppurtunity to live that out. I feel different somehow though. Am I in the valley coming down from the mountain? When I reach the depths of the valley will I remeber what I learned on the mountain or will turn away? I want to be that strong to stand firm and assure like I did when i was on the mountain but as I begin to journey down the hill as I know I must go I lose my focus, I begin to lose my sight. Keep hold of me on my journey place people and things in my life that anchor me to you in a way like never before. Grab hold and don't let go. FOr even if I bite the hand that feeds me sometimes I never want you to let go. I never want to be apart from you.
