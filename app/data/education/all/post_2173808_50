I'm sure everyone has seen those  urlLink MSNBC/Zogby polls  from Iowa, but there's one aspect that hasn't been reported--the second choice preferences.  Unfortunately, they don't give second choices broken down by first choices, but they do have Kerry leading second choices with 25 percent of the vote, Edwards with 18, Dean at 17, and Gephardt with 14.  That could be good news for Kerry since the 15% viability threshold means that some caucusgoers will be forced to vote for their second choice.
