urlLink Fighting Alcohol and Substance Abuse among American Indian and Alaskan Native Youth. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Nancy Gale.  From the ERIC Digest:  Data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (National Institute, 1989) show that about 50 percent of all U.S. adolescents have used alcohol. The comparable figure for American Indian and Alaskan Native youth ("Native youth" hereafter) is approximately 80 percent (Beauvais, Oetting, & Wolf, 1989). Early experimentation with alcohol and drugs places Native youth, in particular, at risk for serious problems. What creates this situation, and, more to the point, what is happening to correct it?
