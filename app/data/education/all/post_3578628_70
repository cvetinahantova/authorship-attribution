I know. I complain about this a LOT. But i honestly dont like babysitting very much. Okay...take that back. I like babysitting..within reason. Every day from 12:30 (when drivers ed gets out) till 9 at night is  not  within reason. I've babysat for these people (i'm here right now) for about..three years i guess. I've practically raised these kids. Their parents are freakin workaholics and it breaks my heart when they're kids are like "yay! i get to see my dad on tuesday!"..when it's only friday.   My sister watches two kids from a different family. (Not meaning to build off of spencer's blog here but..) Their dad is a doctor..and she gets paid less then two dollars an hour. (The normal going rate is 5-7 dollars). Meaning that when she was at their house for thirteen hours, nd fed their kids breakfast, lunch, nd supper, she got $25. Sucks, right?  Little girls are the worst to babysit. Especially around the age of 3-5. They have this idea that they are the BOSS of the house when their parents are gone. It's tough work telling her that I, in fact, am the BOSS. But sometimes you have to give in and let her be the BOSS. Or get online..and let her sit on the couch and pretend to have a baby. Honestly, that's what she's doing. The other little girl is going "oh..i already have a hundred of  those . Crazy.  Little boys are better then that. They're content with watching Reading Rainbow and playing with electronic light up weed-wackers. Complete with REAL SPINNING BLADE! No joke. It's made out of rubber.   I know can always say NO to babysitting. But i dont have a "real job" and i need money once in a while. Unfortunately, i wish this were  like  a real job and i could call of sick today. Nick's going to my house at 3:30 to paint our basement for us..and i want to be there! But no, i'm stuck till 9 ish. Hopefully I'll get more then 25 bucks.
