Frank and (a Hill of ) Beans   Brian Daubach, my favorite '01 Dirt dog, has been given the pink slip to make room for no one's favorite '01 Dirt dog, Frank Castillo.  I went to four or five games at Fenway that season and by some creul twist of fate, Frankie pitched every  one, losing all.  (In games, I have attended, the Sox are something like 1-15.  I know.  I'll avoid the world series in Chicago.  My karma is generally bad.  I lose all my money within fifteen minutes of entering a casino.  I am cosmically fucked in everyway that doesn't really matter.)  I trust that Theo knows something I don't, but even if we do have a glut of bench bats and a dearth of long relief, I can think of at least three guys to get rid of before Dauber(McCarty, Crespo, Jones).  I suppose this is temporary until Kim is back and Arroyo can return to the pen, but let's look at a career  comparison between Daubach and McCarty, the two most comparable bench players as DH/1B, OF in a pinch, type of guys:                                                     BA/OBP/SLG/OPS  Daubach      .262  .342  .480   .822    McCarty       .240  .301  .366   .668   And, Daubach is two years younger.  Granted, McCarty can technically pitch, but I'd rather have a hitter with consistently decent numbers and a pitcher than a mediocre hitter who can technically throw a strike and a pitcher.  After all, this move is all about avoiding situations in which we have to take a position player off the bench and onto the mound, right?  The day we come to rely on McCarty for his pitching is the day I throw a shoe at my television.  Hard.
