Seven days and counting before we have to be out of Simpsonville.  We made arrangements to move within 10 minutes of Katy's job and she found out that they let her go yesterday.  The excuse for letting her go was that she was afraid of the patients and she was not taking the blood pressure readings to their liking.  Katy thinks that she was doing just fine and that one of the certified nursing assistants was talking trash about her to the boss.  Maybe the job just was not to be?  Atleast we have an almost full paycheck coming out of this fiasco on July 3rd which will help us tremendously.    On the positive side of things we will be living in cheaper accomodations and I will be able to afford them on what I get with unemployment and what I make at the flea market on the weekend.   Things will be extremely tight but that is better than being homeless or living in a motel for weeks on end.   When it rains it pours.  I wonder what is in store for us next??
