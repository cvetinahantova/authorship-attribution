I was supposed to go to the wake of a friend today. Her Dad died and i feel for her.  But then, it rained. And you know how I am when the weather's a bit cloudy.  Di na lang ako pumunta. It would've been pointless kasi, I think. You go to a wake to comfort somebody, not to find someone who will give you comfort.  I'm now feeling moody and a bit crazy. Medyo buong araw ko na rin kasi nilalanghap ang singaw ng pintura sa aming kwarto eh.  We painted our office today.  Kinda rad since no else followed suit.  Fuck them if they just go baaa with the herd.  The bad thing lang nga is that I've been in this stinking room for the whole day.  These fumes, it does things to a man's brain. It's 6:30 PM and we're supposed to be off by 3:30.  Medyo nagsi-sing along na lang ako ngayon sa YM Radio.  Hope I don't distract the priests from their holy prayers.  Moody and crazy...not a good combination...make a note...
