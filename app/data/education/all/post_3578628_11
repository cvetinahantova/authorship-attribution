Well...Barbie's loving words sparked an idea in my head to tell y'all that I'm gone for a FRICKEN MONTH.  Yeah...OHC, Josh Hall, all of us here are going to be in Tennessee for darn near a month.  I'll be back the 17th or so for like 2 days...but then we'll be gone again.  Just tellin' y'all incase you cared.  I'm gonna try to get the "7-day Free Trial of T-Mobile HotSpot Service" so that I can communicate with you guys still like via email and crap.  Well...thats about all I've got to write.  Just wishin y'all fun without me and hope nothing bad happens while I'm gone...and if it does...for MY sake...CALL ME!!!!  Thanks guys!  Take care...oh...just so you know...I'm leaving the 2nd of July...so I've got the rest of this week to "hang" for like maybe an hour each night...so....we'll have to try to get together.  Thanks guys...(wow: i've said that alot)    This is Josh Hall and OHC...signing out!
