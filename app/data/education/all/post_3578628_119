Kev, first I'd like to say that I never really am upset that much to put a crack in our friendship.  I mean people all have differences in their lives and we have to overcome them.  If I have been angry at you and/or about you, it never lasts.  I always just let it go and keep on going, it's nothing that I would hate you for.  Now you might think differently about me and how I act, but I thought I'd just let you know that.
