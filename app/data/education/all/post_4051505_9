good god. what a day. i can hardly type cos of the fact i'm freezing cold and recovering from being absolutely terrified. today me, meg, j and sara went to the stream again...we went in, fully prepared-trousers rolled up and sarongs fluttering in the breeze. me and j were the first to go in, and the freezing water made our feet numb! then meg went in. sara wisely refused. we paddled around for a bit then we ate our picnic consisting of sweets, biscuits, crisps and a single, useless chicken sandwich, hand-prepared by my very own mother. after that we went in the stream again, which was knee-high, and guess who had to fall in? me. so then on our wet, depressed and generally boring way back, walking along the roadside, j in a skirt and a white, soggy top, which looked see-through because of the water, we look down at the ground as we walk, having abandoned meg and sara to pick out thistles and glass from meg's feet. whilst looking at the crickets and grass-hoppers, i spot a grass-snake, slithering nearer and nearer towards us. we screamed and ran along the road until we got worn out. then a beaten up old red car beeped us, and went up towards a lay-by to stop. we were terrified, and ran the other way until we realised it had gone. we calmly walked up, only to find the same red car slowing towards us. it stopped and we suddenly realised it was only j's brothers, laughing at us being so scared. we walked home, wet and terrified, as they beeped us one last time for another laugh. i got in, soaked and miserable, and wrote this blog as soon as i could. i'm getting my dinner, then i'm having a long, warm bath. phrase for the day- THE COUNTRYSIDE TAKES NO PRISONERS!
