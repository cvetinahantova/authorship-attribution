IT's another scortcher here in the great Northwest.  Don't let anyone tell you it's a mild climate.  I mean we had a snow storn last winter, and now this!  O.K., so it is mild here for the most part, and those little dips and reaches in temps just makes life more interesting and more seasonal!  I drove to the end of town to one of my favorite espresso drive threws this am, Dutch Brothers.  I got a very yummy NF, 16 oz, decaf, iced, double chocolate mocha, (but Dutch bros automatically makes all 16 oz iced orders into 20 oz).  I love Dutch Bros, becuase their lattes/mochas are sooo good, and their prices are 25 cents to 50 cents cheeper on average per drink than other places (like Starbucks).  I also get another 25 cents off for having a little symbol on my car.  Cool deal, oh, and they have a punch card.  OK, I admit it, Im a latte freak, but who isn't in the NW?  Well, I guess John isn't, and then my parents arn't either.  They all just like getting lattes for occasional treats.  For me its and often treat!  Hmm, I can say that I've been successful in cutting down on the blended drinks (which are worse for you), and I've been getting decaf.  So, a little progress made, but still a fun habit I need to cut down on.  On my way back from Dutch bros, my normallly 5 minute trek took 30 minutes.  Little did I realize that this weekend is "Old Fasion Days" in Newberg.  When I thought I would beat the slow traffic by taking backroads, I just drove myself right into the festival.  Oh well, I got an extra tour of our cute little town, even if I did have to stop for petestrians 20 times! So it's still blazing hot, and our AC is having a hard time keeping up.  Its just not getting down to the tempt we set it on.  Well, at least its cooler than if we didn't have AC.  I need to get myself moving today.  I need to finish packing and get the house clean, especially the floors, they are way overdue!
