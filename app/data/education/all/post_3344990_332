urlLink    This is where I would like to be going today. Across the wooden bridge to the Island on the other side.  I would hope that no one else is there and that I could make the bridge disappear so I could enjoy a few moments of solitude and relaxation.  Shhh, its my dream, dont awaken me...Â  urlLink
