I was just looking over the latest NYT poll on Bush's job approval rating.  The most obvious development is the bounce he's gotten from the Saddam capture.  That's to be expected and probably will be somewhat transitory unless things in Iraq improve rapidly and significantly.    What didn't get much attention are the numbers on Bush's handling of the economy.  They also bounced, from 44-51 approve/disapprove before the capture to 49-43 afterwards.  The latter numbers obviously reflects some spillover from the Saddam capture into other, non-foreign policy areas.  On the other hand, even if you use the earlier 44-51 split as the baseline, this is the best showing for Bush since April, in the immediate aftermath of Baghdad's fall.  If you discount the polls taken during the war, these are the best numbers since last February.  Overall, Bush's economic approval numbers have risen 8 points since August.
