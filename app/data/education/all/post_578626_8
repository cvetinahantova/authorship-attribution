I just figured out how to use HELLO! Like the British tabloid, only with cute babies instead of celebrities-I've-never-heard-of. So, here's pictures of The Boy. I intended to use this Blog as kind of a journal of motherhood, but it's a place of random babbling as well. That's OK because I don't think anybody reads it but my wonderful husband (who made me quesadillas for dinner tonight).
