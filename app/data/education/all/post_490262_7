I have students who are so disorganized, it boggles the mind.  These are the kids who, when we get down to the lunch room, say "We were going to lunch?  I didn't know that.  Can I go get my lunch box?"  I am a fairly organized person and these kids drive me crazy!  Unfortunately, these are also the kids that need to sit in the front of the room or right next to my desk.  All day long I'm surrounded by them.  And then there are the kids who are smart and funny and really together. I love working with these kids.  They never get to sit by me... *Sigh*
