my return to training has not been an easy one. i've lost the stamina that i had before the accident, my suburi is a total mess and i'm feeling the after effects of the accident every day. i'm physically slower, easily confused and light -headed frequently. i tried to keep upÂ during last wednesday's training. despite the fact that it was easier, i was panting away. i need to get back into shape fast. maybe absolution is the key. during this sunday's east west tournament i totally disappointed myself and my team with my lacklustre suburi which was a random mess of poor coordination and bad tenouichi. i have to try harder.
