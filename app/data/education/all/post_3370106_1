Walking along the river this morning with less time than normal caused me to think about the quality of my steps.  How deep can one take it, each step feeling the earth pushing back springing forward with the strength and balance of musculature developed over years of practice and how much evolution?    True, mispractice has shadowed my every step at times and haunts my body still with pain, improper alignment, creaking and cracking such that I'm tempted to self diagnos arthritis.  But whether through misuse, disuse, abuse, or the effects of time itself, I realize that healing is a very real possibility, at least, something that I am commited to doing my part in to make possible.  The set of conditions necessary are not particularly clear to me except that I must be active and at the same time deeply rooted without being stationary.  Now, finally, beginning to sift out the truth through the sieve of experience I see that the remainder is nothing, yet it is everything.  Every grain of sand, every gradient of existence, everything remains as it always was and as it will be.    Placing myself into this mixing room of life and for the first time admitting that I have questions and asking appropriately while remaining open to whatever feelings come when I get the answer.  Because, I know what I want to hear, but I'm often challenged to really listen.  If I want to know the answers, or even understand the question, was it really appropriate, then I've got to listen with full attention.    Today, I will take time periodically to set aside all distractions and focus in on the one true source of our condition, the everpresent, limitless resource of the divine spirit within each of us.
