Highlights from a good weekend:     1. slept in (til 8ish) on Saturday Morning.  (decadent)  2. worked out. got a haircut. as described below.  3. took the kids on a "date" to donut connection friday morning on the way to jaelyn's school.  4. ate sumptuously at Greg's generous hand.  5. nice conversation with adults -- Lynn, Greg, Marcia, Rhoda, Daniel, Mom & Dad --   6. got to cook.  7. took a late evening walk around our magical circle...  8. added  urlLink No Such Thing  (tentatively, but probably for the long haul) to my top five favorites movie list.  That list has a flexible membership which currently includes: Benny & Joon, Rushmore, Zero Effect, The Graduate, The Royal Tennenbaums,  and a sort of floating fifth place that looks like:   Mumford, The Good Girl, Chocolat, Donnie Darko, Harold & Maude, Before Sunrise, Unbreakable, Mr. Jealousy...  This isn't my list of THE BEST five movies, mind you, just my favorites.  They have complex and coherent enough narratives for me to not get "bumped" by them *&* they make me feel a certain way.  A good certain way.  Which I don't have a name for.  Happy Birthday, Marianne & Trena! (even though you don't know each other...)  peace~
