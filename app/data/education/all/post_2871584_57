I feel like I have constantly been on the go lately.  Getting into a new job, a whirlwind weekend of company and concerts, and the usual day to day stuff that seems to take up whole days on its own.  All in all, it's been a good couple of weeks, but I'm SO glad that I have this weekend off, so I can just sit back and relax a little.    Today has been fairly busy.  I ran a bunch of errands, did some laundry, cleaned my apartment.  That means that tomorrow, I have a whole day, just to chill and relax.  In any case though, here are the highlights of the past week and a half:  ~A bunch of us almost got kicked out of Zebb's.  (You know you're in trouble when the manager asks if you called him over to the table just to abuse him... and then you later discover that he's the owner's son...)  ~Mom and Sarah came to visit for the weekend, and we did all sorts of stuff.  Set Sarah up with a cell phone, saw where the townhouse she's renting next semester is, did a *bunch* of shopping, and of course, went to Sarah's birthday concert.  The concert was totally awesome (although sorely lacking a much desired tapestry  :-( ), and then we got up nice and early the next morning so everyone could head out.  ~I got the next installment in my family's dysfunction.  Every time I think that I've gotten to the point where nothing can surprise me, I manage to be proven wrong yet again.  I guess it's good that something in my life can exceed my expectations, huh?  ~After everyone left, I ended up getting called in early to work a ten hour shift.  Between a very busy weekend, and a long shift at work, I spent most of Tuesday catching up on some much needed sleep.    ~Wednesday and Thursday, the network was down *again*.  Thankfully, I was working enough to where it didn't really matter.    ~Friday was a long day at work, but lead into a full two days off, which I'm enjoying very much.    And now I'm just waiting until Monday, so the whole pattern can start all over again...
