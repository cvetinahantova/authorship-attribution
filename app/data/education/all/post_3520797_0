Just got back from northern Michigan today after having been gone for 10 days.  Have done 3 loads of laundry so far and am ready to drop dead... waiting for the dryer to stop and hoping for an IM from D.  D is really on my mind all the time now, like a stain.  I like this stain though... I am working hard not to fall fast for him, to take one thing at a time, to live "in the moment".  All of this is not in my nature though, and I want him now, I want it all now!   He was on the phone with a college friend when I got him tonight - he said he'd be back on IM but then never was.  I'm not sure what to make of this... was hoping he'd be glad to talk, welcome me back, all that good stuff.  I did talk to him yesterday though so I shouldn't be making a big deal out of it.  But of course I'm obsessing already... wondering why he didn't call or IM back when he got off the phone.  Could be any number of good reasons.  I just miss him and wanted to talk, to set something up for this week.  Had a GREAT time up at the cabin.  We suprised my mom with a 60th bday party and about 20 of her closest friends and relatives.  She was very happy with the whole deal and it really worked out well.  My sister, aunts and uncles and I did all the preparation.  Keeping the secret was hard - I tend to give off a "somethings up" look on my face and can't usually hold back something I'm excited about.  I go back up north here in less than 2 weeks :)  Can't wait for that.  Am so ready for the down time again - this time it's solo and I hope to get my head together on some personal issues and begin to move forward with some lifestyle changes.  I'm not so unrealistic as to think I can change everything in a week, but I'm going to try to get started.  Would like to write more, and more often, but have been busy, away or just plain pooped.  Want to make something more of this blog but right now you'll have to settle for this.  Ciao!
