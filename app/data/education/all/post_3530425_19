I love having my own house.  I love being able to read until 3 a.m., and no one says: "why don't you come to bed now.  You'll be tired tomorrow."  Last night, I loved going into my kitchen, right next to my bedroom, and getting a glass of water.  I love my old, funky furniture.  I love being able to paint the walls whatever color I damn well please.  I love being able to smoke, or not.  I'm even starting to love scratching my own back.  Never, not once, have I wished to be married to Michael again.  Nope, not at all.
