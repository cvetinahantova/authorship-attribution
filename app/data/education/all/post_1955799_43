Went to class, then Wal-Mart.  Love to shop, but I was tired and hungry.  I felt a little light-headed.  Not a good way to do any purchasing.  Got some waffle fries and a soda to offset the hunger.  At work bought some wings (Italian, and Oriental) and celery sticks to fend off hunger.  Drank some tea, but am now chasing down water, which i also need to keep up with.  Will visit family member tomorrow, whom I haven't seen in a while.  I'm looking forward to the meeting.  Remember how some relatives you absolutely dread visiting.  LOL.  Mercifully, that's not the case!!!!
