Welcome to Cela's world I am glad that you can stop by and visit. Right now I am dog sitting for Rebel and I guess Hamster sitting. I get to stay at the house for a week and it kind of feels like it is my own. Gets me thinking about when the time will come for me to really move out and what that will be like. Mom calls almost every hour now so when I am on my one does that mean she will call more? I know they just miss me and want to see how I'm doing. It's all good I don't mind as much now as I did when I was a teenager. That sounds funny, like I'm ancient or something. BABUSHCA! hee hee. Trevor said to me the other day, Cela your 24 so how come your not married? He hasn't found me yet. I thought it was a good answer.  So I bought a dance video that has all the Latin Dances that I've always wanted to learn on it. Rhumba, Cha-Cha, Argentina Tango, Merengue, and some other ones that I don't remember right now. I am so excited though because the dances aren't as hard as I thought they would be. The only bad part is that I don't have a partner so it looks kind of funny dancing a couple dance by myself. But it is so much fun and I love every minute of it. When we went cosmic bowling with the youth on Friday the music there was getting everyone in a dancing mood even Hannah! Yep she was getting her groove on. It was fun watching Z-Diddy, Andrew, John and Steve dance. It was a great time of course I couldn't help moving my feet you get carried away when there is music! I could of danced all night, I could of danced all night, and still have danced some more......
