this morning, between classes i was catching up on emails in the office when sam came in... he just stopped still and stared at me for a minute, and then when i was like "dude, what?", he responded "wow, you type fast... how many words per minute is that???"  i had no idea, but i just researched average typing speeds and found an article analyzing 4000 random people that claims the average person can type around 40WPM (words per minute) and most people just don't have the manual dexterity to "wiggle their fingers" faster than 50WPM... i'm not sure if i agree with that in general, or i just have friends who can type fast from having to type lots of papers in general over the years... either way...  so, then, i went to  www.typingtest.com  to see how fast i could go... first i did a 1 minute test and got 79words per minute raw score, scaled down to 76 when you account for typos i made... then i did a 3 minute test and got 85 wpm raw, 82 with errors... either way that's pretty darn good no matter how you slice it.  so yeah, my fingers go fast i guess.  the end.  if you're bored... take the typing test and leave me a comment how fast you can go for comparison. =P
