hey everyone,  well i got some great news at work today.  i'm splitting all of my classes  with a new girl from south africa.  her name is tameron and she seems pretty  helpful so far.  it's going to be nice to have fifteen instead of thirty.   especially since i'm working on their pronunciation and the smaller the  group the better to ensure that all the girls are participating and  improving.  having thirty means that some of the more outgoing girls can  really dominate the class participation.  i had one girl flat out refuse to  talk today, but i'm hoping with a smaller group some of the shyer ones will  feel more comfortable speaking.  yeah!  other than that i don't have much to tell.  we have thursday off for the  queen's birthday and also mother's day.  mother's day is always on the  queen's b-day so when i informed the girls that in america it is in may they  immediately asked me why.  why is it in may?  i told them because spring  symbolizes the birth, but honestly i have no idea.  i guess us crazy  americans just picked a month without much going on.  anyway... i don't  think they understood my answer which is for the best since i made it up.   well gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ DonÂt just search.
