Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. - Luke 16:10   I remember this verse way back in college. This has made an impact in my life but I wasn't even aware then that the verse was from the Bible. The exact verse that keeps playing over and over in my mind is:   "If you can not be trusted w/ small things, how can you be trusted w/ bigger things?"
