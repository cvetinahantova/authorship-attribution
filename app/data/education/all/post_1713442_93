urlLink SUNY CLD Information Literacy Initiative -- Bibliograpy  It is Sunday night and I don't feel like blogging.  However, here is a nice and manageable list of good reads for information literacy.  It is only 20 items so you could probably read them all.  The drawback is that the list is from 1997.  Doesn't anyone know how to do an occasional update?
