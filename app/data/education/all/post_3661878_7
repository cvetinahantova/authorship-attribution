Well, hello everyone. I have been pretty busy lately with school and everything. I feel like it's two steps forward and one step back everyday with my class. Their behavior is sllloowwwwwlllyyyyy changing. There are a few students who I want out of my class...But oh well. So, today, I was going into the restroom right after the lunch bell rang, and lately, the students seem to think it's okay to run to the bathroom or the drinking fountain AFTER the bell, when they had 45 minutes anyways. :::rolling eyes::: So I said to one of them, *Johnny, who is on my shit list, go line up, you had 45 minutes to get water. So I went into the bathroom. After I came out, I saw Gio, our literacy coach, yelling at him. I come to fine out that after I turned my back, he runs into the bathroom! I was livid. So defiant....So ARRGGHHHHHH...So I reamed his ass for doing that and defying my authority. He just pisses me off.  Anyways. God, I was just thinking how WEIRD it is without my brother around. I miss him, and I hope to see him soon. Duh, I'll see him in like a month, for my cousin's bar mitzvah in D.C.  gonna chill with Sean and watch TV.
