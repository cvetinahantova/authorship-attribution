In horses and chariots manâ€™s Hope reside Such ambitious races cannot be tamed Towards speed and rewards it strives With temporal joy it rides in vain  On false dreams Hope cannot survive Futile ascent it tries to gain Of true strength it is deprived Alas! Hope falls and becomes lame  Crestfallen with colours faint Too dejected to be revived In silence Hope remains Hardly alive  Then comes a light Holy brightness from a saint The Son of God Jesus Christ Hope now breathes again With His promise of eternal life In Christ Hope shall forever sustain
