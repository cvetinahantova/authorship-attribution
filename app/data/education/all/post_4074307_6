Hi All (If anyone is actually reading this!).  Not much going on here today, but I did just watch Bill O'Reilly verbally beat the crap out of some guy from the New York Times.  The one thing he could have burned O'Reilly on, he took from a known left wing web site.  Yeah, because what's written on the web is totally vetted and checked for facts.  Hell, I'm writing here!!!!!!!  Which leads me to the subject of reading, as usual.  Reading is a good way to learn different things from different points of view.  Even though I consider myself a conservative, I have read books by those on the left.  If you want to win, you need to know your enemy, isn't that what Tsun Tso (or however you spell it said) and found some of them quite enjoyable, especially Alan Colms "Red White and Liberal"  But I have to admit that I read a lot more "Right" books, pun intended.  I am currently reading "Bush Country" by John Podhoretz and just finished "the Official Handbook of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy."  Both are very enjoyable, quick reads which I highly recommend.  Next I will be reading Dennis Hasterts book.  Here are some other politically oriented books that I highly, highly recommend: "Let Freedom Ring" and "Deliver Us From Evil" by Sean Hannity "Who's Looking Out For You", "No Spin Zone" and "The O'Reilly Factor" by Bill O'Reilly "The Death Of Right and Wrong" by Tammy Bruce  (Great, great book that exposed a lot of what's wrong with liberal social policy) "A National Party No More" by Senator Zell Miller  (another great, quick read)  If you've read any of these, let me know what you think.  And please, anything you can recommend is very appreciated.
