We met in the students' general assembly, everything went well though. We have started organizing the different committees for the school year that will help the student council facilitate in their whole year activity. I felt happy because of a good participation, students seemed so interested..suddenly I remembered my students in Ateneo, the people in the organization, I miss them...   Last night or I bet this morning while I dozed up in between the attack of my cough I dreamt of my family. My mom was holding my youngest brother, we were about to leave, to go somewhere else which I do not exactly know where, it's kinda vague to me. Then it took me so long to change clothe and arrange my things and people were waiting, I feel so sad and anxious and afraid, for reasons I do not know. Suddenly we were leaving but my dad, mom and younger brother were not coming with us...I just kiss them goodbye and I woke up with that poignant feeling of leaving..I don't know..perhaps I just miss them so...soon i'll be home.   I texted jorge today, he told me he's going to their office. He is busy now especially when he is about to leave for work...this is the way it is, I needed to get used to it. I have to learn to detach myself to people I love because the reality of life impels me to accept the things I cannot change, things that needed to happen in one's life like saying good bye.    I learn to be happy in whatever that comes  along my life. Perhaps this is real peace, the sense of freedom to be happy wherever I am, whatever I have or do not have.    My heart is always grateful.
