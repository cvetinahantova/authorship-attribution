there's nothing to write about right now i'm just bored.. and that comment from earlier made me think about Julio, Showtime and Roach. hehe it's a shame we all only had that one small get together at the car wash! we know where they live we should go stalk them and yell at them for never calling us.   something i noticed today. my poor cat is a walking sexual innuendo.. he's a 3 legged pussy named BJ. that's really sad for him. i guess.. i dunno.. maybe i just have a dirty mind and my cat is the product of it.   and something else to comment on.. since when did john become the babysitter? i went to the store earlier and being the older sibling it didn't even occur to me i had to tell them where i was going i just told them i'd be back in 20mins. john practically tackled me and grabbed the back of my shirt and refused to let me go until i told him where i was going. so obviously this annoyed me having just woken up from a nap and i was slightly irritable. so i pulled away which only made him jerk my shirt which hurt but i wouldn't give him the satisfaction of knowing that he's stronger them me. thanks john.. how sad is all this? that makes me wonder if maybe she told him to make sure i didn't wander off during the day which pisses me off. what's with my family lately?
