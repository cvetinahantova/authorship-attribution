Where did my mind go?    For three days, I've been wandering around through classwork, homework, housework, momwork, and doing what I could but not completely succeeding at any of it. Why? Maybe it's been a really rough week. But, I've had those before so this doesn't seem like the most resonable answer.   Well whereever it's been. I'm back. I think.  But, here's another question. How can you really tell if you're back or still there thinking your back? And, why can't you remember where you go when you werent here. It's the zoned out thing just without the drugs.   Oh by the way, anyone out there who's into standing up for others/ noble causes/lost causes... there's a couple of sites set up to save the WB show   Angel.    urlLink www.savingangel.com  and  urlLink savingangel.org   They've even connected to a few decent rallies and will be having a rally tomorrow.   For the traditionalists though... check out  urlLink care2.com  or  urlLink amnesty.org ... Go ahead Just.[...] it .
