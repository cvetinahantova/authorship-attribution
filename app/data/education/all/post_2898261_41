Last night as your were sleeping,  And the night light gleam upon your face. I stared at you for a moment, As thoughts just filled my head. I thought to myself how my life would be. To live without you. Unbearable thoughts ran through my mind. How miserable my life would be. Not to hear your voice or feel your caress. I’d go mad within no time. For all colors would turn grey to my eyes. As the teardrops blind my view. For you’re the air that I inhale. For you’re the blood that flows within my heart. Just the thought to live without you. Makes me realize how complete life is with you. And as I kiss you goodnight and embrace you tight. For darling every day in my life. In my dreams, I see only you
