One reason columnists and comedians will be sad to see President Bush go is because of the loss of actual quotes to write and joke about.  He's a cornucopia of material. For instance yesterday the President spoke to a rally in nearby Annandale, Virginia.

"They're damn lucky to be in this country because they would be backslapped if they lived anywhere else. I just pray that they will open their eyes."
