Last night was pretty fun! Had my brother's B-Day party and hung out with the cousins, watched movies(always watching movies when we're with the cousins). Messed around, ate food, played games etc... After everyone left I ate some more and talked to people for a while, kat went to sleep and I was talking to Dane about Soul Caliber 2. We planned on playing it today but he got an idea for me to just spend the night and play it all night. So that's just what we did, he picked me up around 11:30... Went to his house and started it up, did single player until we figured out Link didnt' have to be unlocked(Dane's character). So we played PvP and he got his ass kicked, poor Dane couldn't get it... So we playeed SSBM and he kicked my ass, I'm just sorta at my skill limit for that game. He felt better afterwards... So around 2 we went to sleep. Woke up to a fog horn, that was nice*cough*... Got up around 8 and started Soul Caliber again, but this time he was even with me! That was strange, he got better over night... He kept throwing the dan bombs*twitch*. Anyways, we played a game out of 15 and he lost 15-13. We're about even though, it's sooo fucking fun!! So yeah, came back around 11, took a shower and har I am. That's good for now, buh bye...
