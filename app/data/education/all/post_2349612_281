found: the book that i was looking for 2 nights ago and 2 kiwi-lime scented candles i bought the same weekend but had forgotten about... they were in a box of to-be-recycled paper and old receipts from the semester  next thing i need to find: the actual notes from when i first gave the talk i plan to give next tuesday... so far i've found in process notes-to-myself from when i was writing it, but not the good copy, and i don't wanna rewrite the whole thing!  blah  later dudes
