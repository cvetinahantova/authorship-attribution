i was supposed to join my family in a gathering yesterday.  something we've always done since time immemorial.  but instead of going to another senseless family gathering where all i can expect is to be criticised by my various relatives, i spent the time trying to understand a friend - a new friend yet again...  we spent most of the day together - had a healthy jog (actually it was more of a walk pero di ko na sya hiritan Ãœ) at UP in the morning, watched a new flick at Centerpoint ( WARNING: WATCH A MOVIE AT CENTERPOINT ONLY IF YOU HAVE A STRONG STOMACH.) , and went to Intramuros to watch the night sky.  interesting nga eh this day.  it wasn't as good as i thought it could be, but it wasn't a disaster either.  this day, i was able to see more of my friend, know more of her, understand her better.  of course i won't say that all went well.  in fact, there is still that vocabulary incompatibility that constantly got in the way.  yung tipong it really takes an effort to get things across.  ewan ko ba.  i'm just glad that there is an effort from both our ends to try to find a solution to it.  unlike a previous sad experience of mine before...  we had a meaningful time yesterday.  a day worth living.
