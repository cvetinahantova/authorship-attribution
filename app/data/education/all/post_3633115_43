S is a paramedic in a large sized city not far from here.  He really likes it (usually) and gets paid very well. If any of you know about paramedicine you would know that as a rule....teachers are paid better.  Luckily, S makes a nice enough income that it allows me the privilege of staying home and not having to work while I go to school to get my elusive degree.          S was born and raised along the coast, while I was raised travelling from Air Force base to Air Force base.  So when we moved to central Texas, it was somewhat normal for me and completely foreign to him.  So why is it now, that I can see the light at the end of the tunnel (I have two years left before I graduate) that I want so badly to return to the coast and he wants to stay here?         Don't get me wrong.  This area is beautiful.  They don't call it the Hill Country for nothin'.  However, I would much prefer to be where ALL our friends and nearly all our family is.  Why would he want to stay here?  I know it isn't because of the money.  He isn't like that. Money actually means very little to him.  I know it isn't his friends...because we have NONE here.  I can't really explain why though.  I guess it's because I have nothing in common with majority of my classmates (after all I'm 27, married, and have a son and they are 20 and disillusioned) and S just really prefers a different kind of friendship than one that includes coworkers.         I would be much happier being where all our friends are.  Since he had lived in the same place his whole life, his friends are "childhood friends."  Something that I missed out on.  I can't imagine him just wanting to see them haphazardly as he passes through town.  I think perhaps I'm reading to much into this desire to stay put.  Whatcha think?
