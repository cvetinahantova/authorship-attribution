I have raised $300 so far for Nancy and sent the checks into NEADS yesterday.   I would like to mail checks collected by the group as we receive them.  I am requesting that you bring your checks weekly on Sunday when we meet.   Be sure to make a note of your donors so you can acknowledge them  with a thank you postcard.  NEADS will mail their tax receipt directly.   Our goal is to complete the fundraising in the next few weeks.   I will let you know how we are doing weekly once we start collecting.   Please let us know if you need support.  I suggest mailing or emailing the letter I circulated.  Let me or your mentor know if you did not receive the letter.   Remember each of us only need to raise under $150 !     Thanks for your generosity in the effort you are making to train and to raise these funds for Nancy.  She is so very grateful and your efforts are going to make a huge difference to her life forever.
