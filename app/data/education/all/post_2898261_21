Listening to: Light my way - Audioslave Mood: Tired and melancholic    After a restless night and a brief but interesting morning, I find myself on here…  Yet another night spent tossing and turning, waking from dreams that made no sense, and walking around the house trying to dispel bad thoughts.  I dreamt so much and about things that were so strange: one particular dream that has remained with me was with  P  and  TP .  I guess it was because myself and  ADMV  were talking about them before going to bed, but strange nonetheless that my subconscious picked them to be included in my dreams.    I still don’t feel that I’m a-ok as  PD  would say with all that’s happened. I still feel a lot of resentment and anger towards certain people who are not worthy of being mentioned here.  The cynicism with which they are acting is beyond comprehension and is rather shocking.  Additionally, my mind’s still reeling with the news from work and the implications that it might cause.  Due to this, my sensitivity button is sky high as I realized this morning.    Anyway, I have a busy morning ahead of me.  The house needs tidying, books need organizing, lessons need preparing and I need to do my most favourite of all tasks: ironing… any offers??
