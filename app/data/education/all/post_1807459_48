Well I'm hanging out in Sangin now at the old PC room I used to come to all the time.  I'm killing time until my private.  I came here way early cause I have a ton of time to kill.  Well blogging well help a little.  Last night was fun.  It was Andy's send off.  Everyone met at Outback and had dinner.  From there we went to a place that I had never been before, Jennifer's Itawon or something like that.  It was nice enough.  From there we traveled to The Commune and then to Titanic.  I think I'm going to stop having big meals right before I eat b/c it really hampers my ability to drink well.  I did have a really good steak, but the coke was horrible.  First it was flat as ass and then it was barely acceptable.  Oh well it was fun none the less.  I gracefully bowed out as people were heading to the singing room.  If I would have started singing I would have lost my voice again.  I enjoy having it back and I plan to keep it that way.   I spent a lazy afternoon downtown.  First I went to my favorite restaurant and had some kimchi rice.  Then I hit up Seattle's Best where I read, studied and wrote in my journal.  There weren't many foreigners at all there for a Sunday.  I wanted to see a movie but nothing even remotely good was playing.  I'll definitely be hitting up The Matrix on Wednesday night.  After which we can hangout downtown.  I am really tired, I wish I could take a nap.  I'm going to get a hat to pull over my eyes so I'll never have to worry about that damn sun waking me up again.  Geez why did I come down here so early?   I found my way into a new bookstore that has a pretty big English section.  It is under the Samsung building near the Banwoldang Subway station.  I checked it out today and it is a nice change.
