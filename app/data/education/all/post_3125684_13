As I sat and watched  urlLink Charms for the Easy Life  this morning, I couldn't help but smile and to think how nice it would be if it were only that easy anymore. I have to admit that the budding romance between Margaret and Tom was charming and sweet to the say the very least. Again, I sat thinking I was born in the wrong time. How I would love to be "courted" by someone and not "dating." Forgive me if I offend any lesbian sisters in cyberland or angry feminists who are fighting for their right to open doors for themselves. What's wrong with wanting to be respected, romanced, and treated like a lady.  I don't know of any men (including the few sweethearts I've dated) who would think to send me a box of his "artifacts" for Christmas. I don't know of many women who would appreciate such a thoughtful, inexpensive yet priceless gift from a man. Contrary to the opinion of a few, I would appreciate such a gift.  What has happened? Where did we go wrong? When did we go from "courting" to sexual liberation and casual dating (sex)? I'm still trying to figure it all out. Change is not always progress or good. Today, we think we are independent women and feel proud to express ourselves sexually without guilt or labels. However, I disagree. What's good for the masses isn't always good for me.
