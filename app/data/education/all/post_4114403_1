What paradise have you lost....?         When you're young...people tell you to enjoy your youth. You're supposed to treasure it...immerse yourself in it. That is my lost paradise. I grew up too fast.  I can't remember when or where I lost my youth. I just know that at some point, I began to feel old. In my rush to get to adulthood, I forgot about doing the things kids are supposed to do. Or, maybe my parents scared me so much that I chose not to...I don't know.  Getting pregnant and married at 19 is something that makes a person miss out on a lot. I didn't think I'd miss it. But, seeing Jonathan with his college friends, and hearing their stories...it makes me yearn for that time. I passed it up without a care, and I regret that. I wish I'd dated more....that I'd learned more.... I wish I'd savored it and wasn't so eager to leave it all behind.  It's hard to see myself as my real age anymore. It's so easy to feel like I'm 45 instead of 24...almost 25. I noticed gray hairs sprouting up...they're so wiry and funny looking...very noticable on my head of pretty brown hair. It reminds me of what I'd done wrong...the pissed away years...the things I regret.  On the other hand, it makes me see how much I've changed...how much I've grown. The independence I've discovered within myself is worth the gray hairs some days...it's worth the stress of keeping up with the things I love so dearly.  Perhaps youth is something that one finds again later on. Perhaps we live vicariously through our children...no matter how much we tell ourselves not to. Or, perhaps we're just left to enjoy the aspects of adulthood as they come, and to remember the lessons we've learned in our past.
