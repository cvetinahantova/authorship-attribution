Post number 30! Everyone dance, now.  But really, I just wanted to wish everyone a great weekend.  I leased an apartment today. My move-in date is set for Sept. 1st. It's not R.'s parents' place, but more on that later.  He was a wonderful, loving boy today and helped me beyond belief. These are the times that I realize how lucky I am. And they are the times that erase anything negative that has come before.  I'll update soon. I have to go to class (ugh!)  Love to all!
