And another episode draws to its conclusion   Tomorrow I'm going to Buffalo, and on Monday I'll be at the consulate to get my study permit. I don't expect anything to go wrong... The procedure is fairly normal, and there's no reason for them to give me any trouble. With luck they'll give me the permit on the same day, if not the next, and since I already have my visa (the worst thing that'll happen is that I'll have to extend it), and then I'm set for school. Well, mostly. I'd have to drop by the office at Waterloo and get cleared to sign up for courses, and then I will need to talk to the person in charge of housing, but that's too far into the future to worry about. Right now I'm a bit tired... I've been up late yesterday *waggles eyebrows*. I think I'll take a nap. Yeah, that sounds nice.
