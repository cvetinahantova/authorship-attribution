I am here!! I am not sure what I am doing, but I am here! I have never used a blog before. It appears to be much like an interactive Buletin board / chat room service. I think it could be useful for students if managed correctly. They will need detailed instructions about what a blog is and how you wish them to use the blog. My husband says if I see a blog to approach it very carefully and capture it alive if possible. Ha-Ha!! Have a good day! Arlene
