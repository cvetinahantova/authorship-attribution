Due to unforeseen complications, there will be two posts today- Movie Reviews and Politics and the Economy.    Two Weeks Notice:  After a stretch of movies for me, I had to get another one for the wife.  And oddly enough, I kind of liked it too.  One reason- Hugh Grant.  His one-liners throughout the movie made Sandra Bullock tolerable, which is quite a feat.  So in spite of the annoying female lead, I give it three out of five stars.    Butterfly Effect:  My first big Netflix letdown.  The rental only disk they shipped me wasn't double-sided, so I could only watch the Director's Cut and not the theatrical version, which is usually on the top side.  Big deal, some may say, but if you thought the ending for the Director's Cut was as stupid as I did, it would have been nice to have the theatrical version to at least compare it to.  Overall, I really disliked this movie.  It was unnecessarily sadistic and vulgar, and it seemed like they were just trying way too hard to be so thematically dark.  And don't get me started on the logical inconsistencies.  It was one of those movies I walked away from thinking that I just spent two hours of my life and got nothing worthwhile out of them.  One star out of five.  The one star is for Ashton Kutcher for at least attempting to play a serious role.  Now that you've made the attempt, never do it again.  Thanks.
