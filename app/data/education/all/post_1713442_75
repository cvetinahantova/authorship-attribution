urlLink Spam Free Web Search - GoGuides.Org  Yet another volunteer editing community that is building a Web directory.  Like  urlLink Zeal  and the  urlLink Open Directory Project , editors are building a searchable database of the Web including only good sites.  Unlike Zeal and the ODP, no search engines use GoGuides.Org data.  The work is mostly in vain.  This makes it similar to  urlLink Joeant .  However, Joeant is better developed.  I signed up with GoGuides.Org and I will help to develop the library categories.  I'll do what I can to make the Web more user friendly for users.  And who can argue with a directory that works hard to kill spam sites? Maybe GoGuides.Org can make it big someday.
