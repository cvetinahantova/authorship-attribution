Ok I'll blog a little bit.  Everytime I'm in the PC room now I seem to be chatting.  I guess people are back on MSN now.  Becareful what you ask for b/c you just might get it.  The weekend was good.  Saturday was fun.  Dinner at WABA again.  Really I think this place might be a little bit of heaven on Earth.  Fenton claims he's found the place with the best kimchi in town  but we'll have to see about that.  Fenton's parents hung out again and we hit up the AU terrace after dinner.  This place is just a little bit phonominal.  The weather was great.  My friend Sue-Jin joined us.  Good to see her out.  She is sisters with one of the girls I used to work with.  Caleb also brought his old friend Angela out who I haven't seen in over a year.  So we played the finger a plenty.  And I managed to lose more then may fair share.  I think I'm going to retire from the finger game.  I never knew that when I started it it would catch on to the point of insanity.  I think we need some new drinking games.  I'm a fan of card drinking games.  After AU we went to Funkaholic.  Cool enough.  Ju-mi called me and I went to eat with her and her friends across the street.  We ended up in BB later on.  I was tired and not too drunk, which is good, so I called it a night.   Sunday was Gyeh-son's B-day so we ate at Bennigan's and then got some drinks and hit the singing room of all places.  Lord help me.  I'll write more later b/c there is more I want to say but this is all for now. No spell check
