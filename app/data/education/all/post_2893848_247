urlLink Terry Teachout  gives advice on public readings (via  urlLink Maud Newton ).   He leaves out one important bit of advice that has salvaged (I hope) any reading I've ever done:  21)  Be slightly drunk.  It not only makes you more charming and slightly tragic, but it gets rid of so many of the inhibitions that make a lot of the above advice necessary in the first place.
