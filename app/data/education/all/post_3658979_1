Ladies and gentleman, for your auditory pleasure (ladies...add in the visual pleasure for you), I'd like to introduce to you MICHAEL BUBLE!  (For those of you who do not know how to pronounce French names, that's Booblay).  www.michaelbuble.com in case you'd like to check him out.    I just got back from an amazing concert.  This young man is so very talented.  I cannot find the right words to say.  What other 28 year old singer can entertain 1,000 concert-goers who range from the ages of 15 to 85???  His voice is so smooth and rich, and he's SO very sexy I could barely contain myself.  He is being called the new Frank Sinatra, and rightfully so.  But, not only did he sing wonderful songs made famous by Blue Eyes, Bobby Darin (spelling??) and Van Morrison, he also entertained us with paradies of white rappers, Michael Jackson, and George Michael.  He was hilarious, yet classy.  Does that make sense?  Let's just put it this way.  It may be blunt, but it's true.  Michael Buble is getting men across the world laid.  It's true.  Men, go out and buy yourselves one of his CDs.  It'll be the best $14.99 you've ever spent.  Consider it an investment.  Pop that baby into the CD player at the end of the date, and I guarantee some action!!!
