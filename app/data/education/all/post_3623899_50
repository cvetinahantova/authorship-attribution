Cool Cool Cool!!! I didn't go to school and i was hiding in my cupboard because of my dad as the other day when i didn't go to school he wasn't happy about it so today i just had to hide in there.It wasn't easy at all as the space limit was very tiny.All i did was just stand sneeze & sweat.It was terrible.[haha] I was waiting and waiting.Then mydog came in she saw me in the cupboard and was prob wondering what is my owner doing in there.Thank goodness she didn't bark or i would have been caught by the  '  DEVIL   "(he's my dad) aahahahahah
