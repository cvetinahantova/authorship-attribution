Fellowship Time      This week I have had a lot of time to spend with some amazing people!!!     Yesterday   as usual I meet up with Celena and Lisa which are in my book group. Each Tuesday it's a blessing to meet with these women and share and pray. Yesterday the place was packed. The owner/worker I don't know what he is, is really nice with us. He even lets us stay in there after they are closed.   Today   we had college bible study. The pastor spoke about decision making in our lives and different points in time where we are caught in crossroads. He encouraged us to walk by faith and trust God in our decision making. This bible study was good. I really enjoyed it because I am facing many decisions at this specific time. Keep me in prayer!! After bible study we hit the usual spot.....STARBUCKS I didn't get coffee tonight instead I went to IN-N-OUT and got some food and a milk shake it was sooo yummy!! A lot of us just sat around talked and joked around. It was fun because some people I had not seen in a while like the twins and Andy because they were being counselors at high school camp which was last week. Well it was like 10:30p and we all wanted to go catch a movie. We headed out to Norwalk AMC first but it was closed so we went to the Long Beach Center Edwards but to our misfortune it was also closed... So we came home. We decided next time we would go to the movies straight after bible study.    Earlier today   I spent the day with my friend and looked at curriculum and all the stuff we have to get ready before the school year begins. All I have to say is WOW I have so much work ahead of me. I pray that God guide me and provide me with patience and grace to tackle all that is ahead.     Upcoming Plans    We are thinking of going swing dancing...I am still thinking about  this. We are also getting together on Saturday and going to the movies.
