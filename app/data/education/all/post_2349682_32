Two classes done with, two more to go. Right on! I so need a break! Well for a couple of weeks I will get to sleep in then I will be working. I think I have all A's for my ASU classes. I know I am not getting an A in lecture for geology, I just hate taking written tests. Those are the worst for me. But I am getting an A in lab which is good, means I am kind of getting it.  There is this one girl in my lecture for geology she sits next to me, we talk all the time, I asked her what she was doing for he weekend and she says she was going to ask someone out on a date. I was like "Wow a bold woman, who is the lucky guy?" Well under her breath she was like, "I date women" so I tried not to show my shock but I don't think I did a good job. I then started feeling uncomfortable but then I was thinking what would Jesus do in this situation, he would love her no matter what right? So I am trying to show her God's love but now she is sick and hasn't been coming to class. I hope she's ok, I hope that I didn't offend her somehow.
