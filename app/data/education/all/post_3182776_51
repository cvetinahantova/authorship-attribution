So the news is that I am officially a teacher. The good old University of Greenwich told me, so it must be true. They also sent me a dinky little letter of commendation. Does this mean I am 'outstanding'? Who knows?  I'm not that bothered anymore.  This time a week tomorrow I will be a married man, and my bird will be  Mrs  Bird.  Now for some men, this kind of statement is prone to induce fits of uncontrollable sweating and shaking, accompanied by fevered visions of beer undrunk, birds unshagged, possibilities of bachelordom as yet unexplored. Strangely, though, I'm not currently experiencing any of these symptoms. In fact, I'm more nervous about the potentially disastrous health consequences of my stag do than I am about hitching myself up forever and a day. To be honest, I'm really looking forward to all of it, apart from maybe my speech, which I haven't written yet, and the bit where I have to dance in front of people, which will of course be judiciously cut from any wedding videos lest the BBFC deem these too scary for public display.  The thing is, I think, that me and Hav have been together for four years nearly. In all of that time, we've been living in separate houses, hamstrung by various parents and housemates and courses and jobs and religion and culture and time and distance and circumstance. So this, at last, is when we finally get to be together, just the two of us, for good and all. And I find that I just can't wait for it to happen.  And, yes, I'm sure that there will be arguments and money troubles and washing up and putting out the rubbish etc, etc. This is, of course, life. But at least it will be life  together . And that's a much better kind, if you ask me.  Which you can, in a month or so, and I'll tell you all about it.  x.
