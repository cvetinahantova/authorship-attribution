Had a pretty nice day at School, several of my classes were good fun today, was able to relax and be a bit human with the kids.  They seemed to pick up on it too.  "What's the matter with you sir, you seem happy."  In fact this week's been pretty good School wise, so thanks God.  Really looking forward to this weekend.  H and I are doing the Mission Order Induction Weekend AND there's Connect on Saturday Night.  D3 are doing it and Dave was talking it up last time we spoke.  So, anticipation grows...
