i'm bored, people! i swear i'm more bored now. this is sooo boring! have you ever noticed that just the word 'bored' makes you feel even more bored than you already are? it's an evil word. i even typed in www.bored.com to see if it would help me escape this boredom but no, nobody can stop me being as bored as i am now. there are 2 people on msn-2! it's silly. nowhere to go, no-one to talk to and nothing to do. i feel like a tinned pickle.
