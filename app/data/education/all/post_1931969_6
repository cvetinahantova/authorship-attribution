Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.  (Όσα κι αν εύρη η χειρ σου του ποιήσαι, ως η δύναμίς σου ποίησον).    The rest of the non-speaking, non-reading Greek can dismiss the above sentence.  It's all Greek to you.  I was looking at my  urlLink "new" homepage  the other day, and stumbled across this verse from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament.  Its simplicity, its power, its wisdom struck me hard.  I don't know why.  The first time I read the phrase it was in the classic "The Caine Mutiny" book by Herman Wouk.  I have never found a more powerful phrase from the Holy Bible, with the exception of the opening of the Gospel according to St. John.  But that's another story for another day.
