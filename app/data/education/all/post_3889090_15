It's in my heart. If I let it go I could be a sick... I don't think I'm special in this regard. When I get sexually aroused, I flip into animal mode and stop thinking rationally. It FREAKS me out. This should not be. I've been there. Porn is a bad business. It's addictive and like any addiction you need more and more of the stuff to get the same high. Then it gets boring and you need to move onto harder stuff. So begins the descent until you plumb the depths of sickness of the soul. I know how it works. I haven't gone all the way, thank goodness, but I could easily. Porn is a problem. I either need to change myself to not get turned on by it (impossible I guess) or just not view it... I don't feel good about myself right now. It is mental abuse of women.
