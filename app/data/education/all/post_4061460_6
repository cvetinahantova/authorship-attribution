I finally worked all of the kinks out of my website. I also updated my page of the school web site. While I was into the whole web thing, I found some great info on business letters that I will use in my classes this coming week.  Cindy did some furniture shopping today in downtown Summerville and picked up a bed, a desk, and three dining room chairs. The girls and I went to Beech Hill and shot some baskets this afternoon.
