http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0518-01.htm  Published on Sunday, May 18, 2003 by CommonDreams.org   Instant-Mix Imperial Democracy  (Buy One, Get One Free)   by Arundhati Roy    Presented in New York City at The Riverside Church   May 13, 2003   Sponsored by the Center for Economic and Social Rights  In these times, when we have to race to keep abreast of the speed at which our freedoms are being snatched from us, and when few can afford  the luxury of retreating from the streets for a while in order to return  with an exquisite, fully formed political thesis replete with footnotes   and references, what profound gift can I offer you tonight?             As we lurch from crisis to crisis, beamed directly into our brains by   satellite TV, we have to think on our feet. On the move. We enter historie      through the rubble of war. Ruined cities, parched fields, shrinking  forests, and dying rivers are our archives. Craters left by daisy cutters,   our libraries.             So what can I offer you tonight? Some uncomfortable thoughts about money,            war, empire, racism, and democracy. Some worries that flit around my            brain like a family of persistent moths that keep me awake at night.             Some of you will think it bad manners for a person like me, officially            entered in the Big Book of Modern Nations as an "Indian citizen,"            to come here and criticize the U.S. government. Speaking for myself,            I'm no flag-waver, no patriot, and am fully aware that venality, brutality,            and hypocrisy are imprinted on the leaden soul of every state. But when            a country ceases to be merely a country and becomes an empire, then            the scale of operations changes dramatically. So may I clarify that            tonight I speak as a subject of the American Empire? I speak as a slave            who presumes to criticize her king.              Since lectures must be called something, mine tonight is called:            Instant-Mix Imperial Democracy (Buy One, Get One Free).  More?... http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0518-01.htm
