Sandra's had the day off work today (headache). I said she would pick a day I can't have off (because of the England match, it would look too obvious) but I had to ring in for her. I was up at 04:00 again last night so I could have done with the time off to catch up with sleep.   I filled the car with petrol this morning, went to pay and realised I didn't have any cards with me - oops!. Left my driving license with the lady behind the till, then got Sandra's cashpoint card from home to pay for it. Made me late for work, but the woman was OK with it.  I work with 3 other people, non are English, non are into football (soccer), but they are all going home early at 16:00 to watch the game while I have to stop late to cover the office - where is the justice in that?
