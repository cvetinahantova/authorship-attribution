I am a lazy bastard.  I confess to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have not blogged through my own fault, in my thoughts and in my (missing) words, in what I have done and what I have failed to do.  And I ask the blessed webmaster, ever virgin (he is a computer geek, after all), and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Xen our Blog.
