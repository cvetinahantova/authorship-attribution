I know it's sacralidge, but I really hate summer vacations.  It's all nice and quite for about 2 days then I get bored and start counting the days till school starts.  I've also discovered that the key to keeping roommates and family off my back is to them that "I need to study".  People don't bother me when I am studying, and even less is expected of me.  Now maybe this is the lazy way out, but seriously, it's just so much easier when people don't expect me to contribute.  I have the rest of this week and the weekend untill summer school starts, but I swear, it's just dragging along.  GOD I AM BORED!!! Maybe it would help if I had a life of some kind, but even then I'm not a very social person. My friend Rob is going to Vegas for his bachlor party this weekend so I have no idea what I am going to do all weekend.  I may go out with his fiance Kristin (we went to Vegas for her bachlorette party a few weeks ago) but other than that I'm at a loss. I've also been thinking a lot about life the universe and everything, an adverse effect of boredom I'm sure.  I've gotten on to the subject of exes before in this blog.  Now my question to pose to those nonexistant readers is how would somebody react to hearing from an ex several years after the fact.  My list of exes is horribly short.  I'm still friends with two of them, another I saw last October at my friend's funeral and while we were amicable, I have no desire to see him any time soon.  My last one kinda hates me, which is really pathetic cause well his mommy told him too.  Oh how I hate Mamma's boys.  Yet I can't but wonder how Joe would react to hearing from me.  Or how I would react if he were to call me.  I suppose "what if" thinking is normal, and I don't regret breaking up with him.  However I can't help but wonder what would have happened if I didn't.
