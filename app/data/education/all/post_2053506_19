My brother and SIL returned from a trip to England recently.  They stayed in a few different rooms during their journey.  Neither one of them drink much tea, so wherever they went, they would snag some tea bags for me.  They said every room they stayed in had tea bags and an electric kettle.  I got a nice variety.  Some brands I am familiar with, and some I've never heard of.  I made a pitcher of iced tea with some of them - very good.  Strong, but delish!
