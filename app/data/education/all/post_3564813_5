Well, just got back from town and I bought:   Tony Hawks Pro Skater 4  AND  Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers   They are guite old games but it was only Â£20 for both of them so I got a good deal really.  Later, I plan to go to Darren's and play out, but first I gotta eat, then I will go about 6.30. I just went to Husseins and didn't realise until I saw his bike there, but James French was round! Wow... I didn't know those two were friends! Anyway, I don't wanna sit at the computer too long because I may end up with a hunch back like the fat woman at the library!  Well, at the moment I'm drinking evian bottled water, and it's really not that nice. I could never tell the difference before betweeen bottled waters, but since I started to drink them a lot I can now tell which kind they are, and evian is one of the worst! I mean, the after taste is foul and the flavour is a bit on the sweet side. I definitley like Aqua-Pura a LOT more than this French crap!  Thanks to the caretaker having a wank in his office, he wasn't out in time to unlock the bike compound, so I was late out of school too! On top of that, having a crap teacher forth period was bad too, oh well, not too bad because we don't have her until next Monday now!  I'm so strange today, my mind has gone blank! On all school work today I've been writing the 6th June, but it isn't, it's the 7th... isn't it?  HAHA! I was so bored today, that I watched the Hey Arnold movie, let me say, it was ok, since it brought back memories from when I was a child, but the story was so predictible. Maybe they should have been evicted. (Don't worry, you probably won't know what I'm talking about.)  Hey, i'm now gonna play Tony Hawks 4, so I will probably blog again later this evening, or tomorrow.
