Am I to blame again? It seems I always am. I'm starving for some sort of change in my life, maybe to feel whole again, or just get away from myself. Take a day off from everything or maybe gt some type of sanity. Not depressed, just lost and confused.   Other people's lives seem more interesting, cuz they ain't mine, other people's live just seem more interesting...........I'm fed up and I need to go, out of existance or just down the road, forever..........................  Love you all lots. I'm gonna keep my distance most likely.
