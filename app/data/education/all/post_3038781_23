Is there ever an end to it?  I keep looking through the amnesty usa sites, and care 2, and ecology fund... etc?  Where all that I have to do [and often all that I can do] is click to offer some support , and I am always stunned how much there is to click. It's amazing how unstable and unkind life can be. Well of course it's not life that's being unkind. Its violence, poverty, illness, despair, and all of them fueled by inequality, racism, nationalism, and greed. It's so disheartening even sickening in itself, but if even a clck can help... how can I not.
