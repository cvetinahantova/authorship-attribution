I'm extremely ill, which sucks a lot. Annnnnd there isn't a new OC tonight. :'(   So I didn't go to school today, but who want to anyway? I went yesterday, and nearly effin' DIED, and the stupid biotch of a nurse (SHE IS NOT QUALIFIED!11!!) said I didn't have fever, so I had to stay in class. I cried, because I was so sick. I skipped out on Study Buddy, and junk.   So I heard nothing interesting went on today, anyway. I should catch up on my math homework, because it's due today (but I have an extra day!).   Let's see if I feel up to coming to school tomorrow. (But I don't want to.)
