Okay, surprisingly nothing is really new around here. Siri isn't talking to anyone and when ever someone calls her house she just picks up the phone and then slams it down...can you say SYCO?!!!?!?!?! And Alex is here and he is a huge pig. He eats everything in site and then never cleans his mess.. leaving it for me! I reallly hate it when people do this so now I'm starting to leave messes and he actually can't stand it when other people leave messes and then i just blame them on him. So, i guess i have this figured out! Oh, and also,my mom has been being really cool lately, and so her and i have been getting along.. which is good because it is my birthday week and she and i have to get along because she's incharge of the party! hee...
