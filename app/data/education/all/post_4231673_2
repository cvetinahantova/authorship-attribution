Thank you for having me/us.  First, Carey was excellent, again - we really value the chance to talk through things with wise other Christians, to be challenged, to be taught, to sing and so on - particularly in our more isolated Christian situation. As I said elsewhere, I found John B. on Acts 2:42-47 particularly helpful - though the fact that I was looking after Charis in bed on the Wed evening meant I didn't get to hear the sermon that everybody else is talking about. I'll listen to it over ironing soon .... yes, some men do iron! (occasionally)  Secondly, can I make a suggestion? If you have the internet nouse to do this, you could also contribute to bulletin boards. Did you know there are boards out there where people are still able to debate real things as though opinions matter - even argue? Very non-post-modern! For a long time, I haunted  The Independent  argument board, and was able to get into discussions about morality, sexuality, science "vs" religion etc. It was a real meeting place of ideas - a modern areopagus. I even set up my own bulletin board at areopagus.co.uk for a while - but it never really attracted any attention, even from the Christians I told about it. So.... if you feel you can argue for Christianity, go and find a bulletin board to talk on as well. Fellowship is great - and the fellowship we have had through Carey is amongst the best we have known - but we are called to evangelism as well. Let us know how you get on! Let us know if you need help in a particular discussion!  Paul F.
