There is positively no logic to the pricing of  urlLink Air Canada  tickets whatsoever.  Our travel agent got me a cheaper ticket to Narita Airport for $845.00, all taxes included, with less notice than we reserved the last one. Go figure.  I collected the letter from my doctor's office (she is still using a  urlLink dot matrix printer !!) stating I am "healthy and free of any communicable diseases".  That's one spot of good news.
