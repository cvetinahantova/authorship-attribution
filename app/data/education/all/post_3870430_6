first of all - thankyou to everybody who has been posting comments here at the Hub. Its made my life a lot easier, and I think - I THINK - we've got everyone listed, and everything pretty much under control.  You guys are my eyes, ears, and beta-testers - if you click a link on the Hub that doesn't work, notice something missing, or see something broken, I won't know unless you tell me. Pretty much everything that has been fixed or made better here has come from your comments - so thanks guys, I appreciate it. Keep it up.  I'm really thrilled to see how supportive and generous people are being on the blogs comments lists. I think we all know that this isn't the right place to share the darkest secrets of your soul, but I have noticed that whenever someone says they're feeling a bit down, six comments will go up to make them feel better. It goes to show - 8S really is a supportive group. Well done.  Special mentions for this week go to...  MEG for having the first on-line poll, and for accepting criticism gracefully (I cannot stress enough how valuable a skill that is)  LACHLAN and EVAN for having excellent (but not  quite  matching) backgrounds, and for offering to share their knowledge with anyone who wants to know - thanks, boys  DAVID for a particularly interesting (and very funny) criticism of George Dubya Bush  BLAINE who, after a relatively late start, put up a first post so insightful that he got a supportive comment from another melbourne blogger  in the real world...   TOM for a very impressive combo of quality  and  quantity (how am I supposed to read all of that? Huh?)
