What can I say about my daddy. He is and was the smartest, funnist and most respected man I ever knew. I will miss calling him at all hours asking him to clarify something that my friends and I are in disagreement on. I will miss calling him everyday to see how his day is and telling him about mine -ultimately to get advise. My first and fondest memory is of me standing in the backyard of our home in Drayton and daddy asking, 'Who loves daddy?' and I would raise my hand and say, 'I do!' Now I do that with my son and it is the greatest joy. I can't tell you all how much little George looks like Daddy and it brings such joy to me to know that his name will live on - and hopefully his brains too!! Thank you Alicia and Deb for putting this together it means a lot to see how dad touched others lives so that we can pass it on to our children.  Love to all. K', Paul and Litte George.
