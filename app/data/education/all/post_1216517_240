Hi again.  Robyn says, "Hi!"  We are in a coffee shop listening to Bob Marley.  It smells good in here.  The coffee is very tastey on the Islands.  Probably because they tell you it's supposed to be.  I am reading  Moneyball .  All should read it.  Fascinating book on baseball economics.  Rob Neyer told all that it has been optioned into a movie with Clooney playing Billy Beane.  Funny.  Let's talk about Jayson Werth for a bit.  Discuss.  Bye.
