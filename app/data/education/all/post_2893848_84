Two wrongs don’t make a left   Liberals starting  urlLink their own radio network  reminds me of  urlLink those people who go on Montel Williams  to confront  urlLink former bullies  with their new "hotness".  While my allegiances are clear, I can’t help but feel like the point has been missed.  You fight a bully on your terms, not theirs.  You don’t fight a bully by learning karate, getting new breasts, or replacing your comically oversized glasses with contact lenses.   I saw Janeane Garafalo last fall when I went to see Steve Earle and Billy Bragg on the  urlLink Tell Us The Truth Tour .  And even if she has become a punk rocker, she still isn’t that funny.  Sure, the crowd loved her, but she is to young, socially-conscious types what Billy Crystal is to celebrities:  because the political assumptions behind the jokes are agreeable, then the joke gets a laugh of concurrence more than of genuine amusement.  This makes the whole enterprise feel uncomfortably disingenuous; she shouldn’t be telling jokes that aren’t funny, she should be giving a speech.  But she shouldn’t be doing that either, because I’ve heard her give speeches and they weren't anything special.  It’s really sad, how people can become prisoner to their marginal talents.    I don’t think the left needs demagogues to match those on the right.  The success of the Republican party is a confluence of their strategies and ideologies.  We can’t beat them at their own game.  You don’t punch a bully.  Make out with his sister.  Booby trap his bicycle.  Go on to one day be his boss, allow him to get comfortable with you and think bygones are bygones.  Then, after awhile, accuse him of stealing from the till and fire him.  But don’t punch him, because even if you will feel momentarily empowered, it will turn out to be a throbbing sort of empowerment that swells and makes your ears ring for a little while.
