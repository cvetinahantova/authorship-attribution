Well, after finishing the homework for Algorithms (which also doubled as a review thingee for the final) I decided to do what I do best - be a flaming geek. See, I have this neat-o flash thumb drive. Which works fine on my laptop. But it didn't work on the workstation at work. It all came down to the kernel not having the proper drivers, which I promptly fixed by getting the newest source and rolling my own kernel (and while I was at it I cleaned the beast out a little bit - the person that set this up just dumped in about any kernel module he could find, even for archaic crap like ISA). So now the thumb-drive was all nice and working, but... The sound card stopped working! A little bit of investigation revealed that the problem lay with the alsa headers, it being that there were none installed for this kernel. No worries! Good ol' Google saved me there, and all I had to do was apt-get the alsa-source, build it, and reboot. Now, I still need to add a few bells and whistles here, because I can mount the thumb drive with two clicks on the laptop, but need to manually mount it on the workstation. That's no biggie, since I use the command-line quite often anyway, but it's still a thorn in my side. I'll just have to go back read the automount documentation.
