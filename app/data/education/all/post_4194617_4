This was Kerry vs. Bush day today in PDX. It was hard to get any news coverage given that there were a few other fascinating things competing, like Mighty Hurricane Charley in Florida, a resigning and newly out governor in New Jersey, and the opening of the Olympic games in Athens. Oh, and that pesky situation in the middle east.   Anyway, for those of us actually paying attention, we enjoyed a very interesting juxtaposition of styles. Bush played to a small group of invitation-only small business owners in Beaverton. Kerry held a huge rally in Portland's Waterfront Park to which anyone could come. There were lots of body blows, hair pulling and illegal chair usages. Although I didn't hear much new on either side, I have to award my vote for the winner to Kerry for style - hands down!
