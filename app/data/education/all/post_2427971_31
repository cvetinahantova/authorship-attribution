After reading my friend's Blog I've decided to create my own. I've been keeping one of my own but it just hasn't been accessible to anyone else but myself and the gremlins hacking into my computer. I'll eventually add in my entries from before this all, there's a whole fucking lot. I think there may be about 12 pages of 12 font single spaced, that's from a year of idiocy. This to me is nothing more than a stress reliever, it works well for me and I prefer it over the other options I have(no need to mention). With my crap personality(well aren't we positive!) I'm really edgy about what I put out, yell at me if you know I'm not posting something. Trying to fix myself to do so. I can so very easily ramble on like this for-fucking-ever and since I feel like it I will continue. Whoever reads would do me a great favor by yelling at me some more if I just stop posting, because once again that's the opposite of what I want to accomplish at the moment. From what I can tell I only have about 3 or 4 different personalities, shall I bore you more with what they are?! YES I SHALL!! HOORAH! Anyways, the personalities strangely depend on my mood. Who would've thought of that?   Caffeine High = Do not attempt to understand Tired = Something close to depressed or maybe even tired 0.0 Pissed off = This is when you should not apply anything I say to yourself, no matter who you are... You'll understand when you read it if you ever do. Just Fine = I enjoy triangles  All of that crap above is only the beginning. I just put the moods thing there 'cause I couldn't think of anything else to post, I hope to continue with this and maybe even have some kind of self respective agency come by and congratulate me on my great work in the field of anatomy. Please send the Pope a pigeon telling him I have his wagon and to be careful in Alaska for the flaming squirrels from the fiery depths of Hell...   One more thing, I do not intend on explaining a lot of my posts. Sorry for any inconveniance.
