I read an  urlLink article  by William Pfaff of the Observer yesterday, and among other things, he made an interesting comparison.  He said that American hegemonic neoconservatism is in a sense a right-wing version of Marxism.  It arrogantly posits a progressive dialectic that will result in the triumph of its system.    Now that I think about it, it makes sense.  Not only does neoconservatism have that imperialistic arrogance,  but the founders of this school of thought, Irving Kristol, Leo Strauss and others, were former  urlLink Trotskyists .  I guess the neocons decided to switch ends of the political spectrum while maintaining the arrogant imperial quest.
