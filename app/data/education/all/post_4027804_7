It rains...I like the rain;  urlLink     *Revision* Like tears of sorrow falling, deeply from high, the drops of rain penetrate, the medium through which it flies; like an anvil from heights, left rippling to the winds force, from the edges of its liquid cacoon, And with each collapse a melancholy norm, a rolling drum beat playing, from the bottom of the rising storm inside each tear, an unheard soul cries for its death, a voice trapped within, awaiting its falling last breath...   I care no more or less for the rain, for now, I am going to sleep. The End...(psyche)  Hyperbole: an extreme exaggeration.  For  example... I am up-to-date on my episodes of Naruto (ep 95-96 special) and I happened to lay my fingers on the trailer for the movie...Now, *hint-hint: hyperbole here* if I don't get to see the movie as soon as it gets here, I'm going to get a katana, shove it up someone's arse, pull out so their rectum explodes and drops their fillings, jab at the spine to dis-lock every bone piece (and if I miss, I will keep trying) fillet their private organ, and carve my signature all over their solar plexis...::blinks::  Ok, do you understand yet?  "Ah..." he sighs while closing his eyes, enveloping his arms around the beauty he claims as his; his item, his being of happiness. Deep in thought, he rests his chin over her shoulders, barely letting wind from within escape his lips, signing in the air one outrageous feeling...  "Ease.."  My two N's.  I'm sure those who know me, and a bit about my life would.... could  guess what the heck that would mean, but then again, don't bother, for there's only one person I'd tell, heh. (don't ask either, for if I don't tell you...  it's not you.)  To know ones future...it gives the feeling of being a pawn in a replay of fate's game of life, where you can only sit back and move as already scripted.
