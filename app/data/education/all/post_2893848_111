A Kind of Guerilla Warfare   In 1981, Lynne Cheney, second lady of the Union, published  Sisters , a "novel of the American Frontier that breaks bold, new ground," "bold new ground" being code for  "lesbian romance."  (Reportedly, of course.  I haven't read it myself.)  See the cover  urlLink here .  (Via  urlLink Maud Newton  )   I think this pretty much speaks for itself.  I'm not generally a fan of irony, but you've got to savor it on the rare occasion that it isn't cheap.  If conservative moralists didn't set inhuman and judgmental standards of behavior, this sort of thing wouldn't be so embarrassing for them.
