Went teaching a bunch of kids from Maris stella primary school to build rafts. It was interesting seeing the different designs of rafts coming up but i wasnt too satisfied with the company that engaged my service cos the organisation wasn't that good. As least not as good as Inno. Supposed to help out in the campfire tonite but decided that i NO MOOD..so go with the flow and tell the coordinator that we are very tired under the hot sun in kallang that we cannot do it tonite....hahaha.....so we SIAM tonite's campfire but got to do the one for Wednesday....just hack care liao lah...  Tomolo going Paddle Culture kayaking again....finally can relax abit after working 5 consecutive days.    Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
