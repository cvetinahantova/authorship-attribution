I hope that I rediscover poetry--or writing of any kind.  I think the time in graduate school just confused things in my head.  A crisis of writing is a crisis of faith for me.  But I've squared away my religious beliefs, and I'm walking down that path.  My writing?  I don't know.  I feel like I'm a better teacher than writer.  Is this true?  Or is it easy?   _______________________________________________________   People here at Teach For America are always sharing their inspirational stories with us.  You can't walk through the cafeteria without someone telling you about how Deshaun wore shoes three sizes too big, or how Dwight finally learned how to recognize "er" endings.  It's funny, but the stories are generally about boys too.  Boys who acted up, but once the teacher got them alone, turned out to be intelligent, thoughtful students.  I haven't  once  heard an inspiring story about a troubled girl since I've been here.  Not from the administration, at least.  Not from anyone who isn't a first-year teacher.  The troubled boy is romanticized.  He acts up in class.  You're grateful when he's absent.  But then you decide to offer him tutoring after school and during lunch.  And you discover common interests.  His family fascinates you.  You never realized the depth.  And when it's time for him to graduate--or he moves away--your heart breaks.  Because he's a boy you've invested your time into for months.  And he's supposed to grow up and become  great .  But what about the girls?  The quiet ones.  You assume they know what's going on.  They're so polite.  They nod when you talk.  They smile and sometimes hug you.  They're eager to tell you their stories, and you listen with when there's time.  And they're so happy.  So happy with any little attention you give them.  And then you give them a test.  Or you call on them to read aloud.  And you realize,  My God!  They're so far behind.  I didn't know.   But you're already spending your lunchtime and after school hours with that troubled boy.  And the girls are so happy.  So polite--they smile and nod their heads.
