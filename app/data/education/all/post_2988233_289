I have no idea why that song is in my head.  I need some make my thoughts go away music.  Hummmmm, maybe some old guns n roses?  Nah, not in the mood for Axle.  Skynard?  nope, this is bad, I don't even know what kind of tunes I want to listen to.  Called Tommy at work, he can't give me the silent treatment over the phone.  He's still angry.  He's not going to shoot pool tonight.  Thursday is pool night for him.  Friday is poker night.  I can't wait til poker night.  I am in withdrawals bad.  I need my poker fix.    Anyhow, someone asked if I am still worrying.  Yes, I am.  I don't want to lose almost 16 years together over this.  Yes, I am an idiot, yes, I screwed up, this last one was totally unintentional.  But I don't want to lose my husband or my life over it.    I love my husband, and I have known it from our second date.  Yep, on our second date, I knew he was the one.  He says he knew it when I uttered one simple phrase that I will not print here.  (remember honey?)  He of course is joking, or at least I hope that phrase isn't why he married me!  lol.    I can't imagine life without him in it.  No, our marriage hasnt' been perfect, but no marriage is.  But we have a good marriage.  Those are hard to come by these days.
