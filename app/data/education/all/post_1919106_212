Alright I admit it, it's more like rain and more rain. No matter how many times I experience them, thunderstorm have this certain uniqueness to them. One moment you're driving down a dry highway, the next moment it's water splashing all over and everyone that has some brain in them is crawling along at half speed with the hazards on. Notice that everyone with some brain, because there's always some stupid asshats that end up killing themselves. Like the one I passed by. All 3 westbound lanes were closed, and fortunately the accident happened by an exit so we could get around. The suicide fucktard was driving a Corvette. I know that because I saw the car's tail, which is about the only piece that was left of it. The cab was crushed, and the engine was shredded to bits. From the looks of it the guy was going too fast, lost control, and ended up under the wheels of the 18-wheeler that was parked diagonally across the highway. I'd feel sorry for the guy (or gal), except that he/she probably had it coming. So it serves him/her right. I do feel sorry however for the trucker.
