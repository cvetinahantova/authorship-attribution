Well I finally got all of the MIG stuff taken care of before this weekends meeting and my travels begin. I can't believe all of the time that I am putting into it right now. I must be either really dedicated or just very bored? I think it is a little of both.  I have to go to Macomb and get all of my stuff moved out of my old place. This ought to be fun to do in the next day. I have to finish up everything out there before I leave for Beantown. It should be a very fast few days. It is already Wednesday, and still have to pack up all of my things for the big trip.   Oh well. It should be a whirlwind couple of weeks now. Must get some sleep, I won't be able to in the next few weeks not with everything to do for the internship.
