... Is  deskullination , brought to you by  urlLink Something Awful  and the letter  42 .  Summer is here. I'm amazed how the weather transitioned from sub-zero-freezing-my-ass-off-fucking-cold to sweaty-balls-hot in more or less a month. Well, at least the rains cool things down, but the problem is of course that after the rain comes the humid heat and the dreaded bloodsuckers.  Next week is the start of the soccer league here. Just like at TAMU-CC, the Computer Science team is the crappy skill/good standing one. Unlike TAMU-CC, these games are outdoors, something I'm quite looking forward to because that means we can slide *grins*. Of course with the amount of exercise I've been getting lately I'll more likely roll than slide.  Mom seems to be getting along pretty well with Linux. She doesn't use the computer much for anything apart from e-mail and word processing, and she manages pretty well with Firefox and OpenOffice. So it seems unlikely that I'll be installing Windows back on that machine any time soon. Now the only problem is to get my iPod running on Linux, so that I can upload my music. Before I had been using xPlay, which is a quite decent software for what it does, except that it sometimes forgets to update the song index so I'm stuck with the old one until I re-update.  The iPod should be recognized when plugged in, or at least when the modules are loaded. I don't think there's a problem there. Last time I tried I failed to mount it though, but now I know that it's because I was trying to mount  /sda , which is the zip drive (see, even that one works on bootup). So I'm guessing that I have to look at  /sdb , or some other drive. Eh, I'll probably check online.  While on the topic of Linux, I need to find my Q3A CD so I can install it at work. What? It's for, um, research. Yeah. Um. I'm, err, doing some software architecture thingjamabob with it. Yeah, that's it. I'm not slacking off. Not at all.
