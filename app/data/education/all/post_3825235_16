Well, in response to the question...yes!  She did go to bed, and at 8:30, no less.  I just think she still is trying to make up for her loss of sleep last weekend.  But, she is not taking a nap today, so maybe that's the end of that!  Today at work was not too bad.  Very slow, but we did have a few people come in, which is better than the last few days at work when NO ONE has come in.  No plans, yet, for this afternoon with Abbie, but we'll think of something.
