Damn... Wednesday Already?   If there's one good thing about bad days is that time flies when the shit hits the fan. Well, most of the stuff I've managed to deal with, so I'm left with the things that I can't control (but maybe influence). There's the carpal pains for example (which is also the reason why I'll keep this short).  Lately I've been wondering whether Grad School is worth the effort. Sure, I get to do stuff I've liked so far, and I'll get to learn all sorts of neat things I hope, and Waterloo is a  lovely  place... But then I wonder whether it's really what I want to do. On days like these all I really wish for is a nice and quiet living, with a job that'll make me a living but where I don't have to be on my toes all the time. Computer Science is fun and exciting, but it's one of those careers where it's easy to get left behind. Cooking, for example, is different - and something I'd really like to do for a living at this moment.  Blargh... I'm rambling late night again.  Bad me, bad! Go to your place. And no treat either.
