We have a plague. Of slugs. It is utterly vile. What is the point of slugs? I know that question could be aimed at so many creatures on this fair planet, ourselves included, but ... slugs. If I was a slug I'd sure as hell have serious existentialist issues. Blah. Drunkenly asked the boy last night what he would do if he woke up and saw that I had a slug on my face. He said he'd 'pour salt on it'. I somewhat hysterically informed him that the only thing worse than waking to find a slug on your face is waking to find an oozing, squirming slug dissolving in salt and its own juices on your face. Rest assured; there is now an agreed Slug Procedure should any such event arise.  Last night was fun although I ate and drank far too much and learned more about the internal workings of an IT publishing house than I ever wanted to know. To be fair, Jim let me talk a lot about teaching and wasn't too offended by my over-personal questions and grumpy swearing. We left the bar early-ish as Jim had to deliver a ring and this big eye kept looking at him.  In other news, DO NOT be fooled into buying  Onken Wholegrain Yogurt , no matter how enamoured you are of the other excellent varieties of Onken. Particularly the Mango and Vanilla one ... god, that's delicious. But Just Say No to wholegrain. It may seem like a bit of harmless frippery at first, with its jaunty packaging and promises of barley and oats, but in the end you just feel vaguely sick and disappointed, cursing the day you swore off refined carbohydrates and feeling like all the little live cultures are mocking you and pointing as they reproduce asexually.
