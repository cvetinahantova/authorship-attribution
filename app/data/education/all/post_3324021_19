There is one thing we did this year that I am slightly proud of... The Gift of Reading. This community service project is bringing a little bit of joy into the lives of less fortunate children. Tomorrow morning we present the books you donated to those children. Although I am not happy that we offered discounts for the dance in exchange for books, I'm proud of our class all the same. I would like to take a moment to that my fellow officers for a job well done on this project, and the senators who helped us make the hallway banner. Especially Josie who opened up her home for us to make the banner. I would also like to that the english teachers who handed out extra credit in exchange for the books, and to you, the students, who donated the books. I hope you feel good about your self, as you are making someone else feel good.
