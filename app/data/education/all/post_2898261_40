My eyes; like the night sky; darken as each day fades. My pain; once controlling; is replaced by the warmth of your heart. My mind was haunted by memories of what once was. Now it is consumed by the pleasure I can only find in you. Yesterday you were a distant, though sweet memory. Today you own me, body, soul and mind. We can't go back to yesterday and tomorrow may never come.  I choose to live in the moment; blanketed by our love. I cherish every moment, that together complete the puzzle of my life. I love you beyond time and space. You are my Immortal.  I'll love you today and forever more
