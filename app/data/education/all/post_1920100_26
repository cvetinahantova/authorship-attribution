Update:   I asked my mom if she wanted to go to that new church that I heard about, but it didn't work out because she had already made plans with my brother. He is going to take her out to brunch.Maybe some other time, or maybe it wasn't ment for me to visit that church. I didn't have a chance to go to church today because it got too late. I was waiting for my mom and I was talking to her. I gave her, her present. She liked it. I am glad because my mom is not affectionate or warming. She is loving and I am blessed by her.  Yesterday was girls night out!!!! Man this time was blessed. We had a great time. Time flew by. I couldn't believe I ended up leaving until 1:00 in the morning. We were giving eachother pedicures, manicures, massages and we were just talking and listening to some of my worship cds. I bought the new WOW 2004 its pretty good. We also had a chance to meet this girl Amanda one of Shanna's friends. She is not a believer but she had a great time and I hope she spends more time with us and draws near to the Lord. Keep her in your prayers. We were also playing the game TABOO we had such a good time. I really enjoyed myself.   Today I  don't have much to do. I will probably go to care group later on at night. Tomorrow I have a lot of errands to run though....This week is going to be busy for me.=)
