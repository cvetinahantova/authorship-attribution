To help get some more ideas going, I've asked my friend Steve Teles to join me as a contributor to PolySigh.  Steve is an Assistant Professor of Politics at Brandeis University.  He has previous taught at having held previous positions at Hamilton College (where he was in my job for a one-year visiting stint), Harvard, the University of London, Holy Cross College and Boston University. He is the author of  urlLink  Whose Welfare: AFDC and Elite Politics  (1996, rev. ed. 1998)  and numerous articles on such topics as the logic of policy analysis, US-China relations, the politics of affirmative action in Britain, and the social mobility of British ethnic minorities. As you can see he's very narrow in his approach to politics!  He is currently at work on a book entitled  Parallel Paths:The Evolution of the Conservative Legal Movement , which is under contract with Princeton University Press. He is an avid skiier and hopes to drop ten pounds by the times the lifts open in November.
