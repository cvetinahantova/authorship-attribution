Well, I will be finished with my 9th grad school class this week! I will be starting my 10th and final class next week - no break...as usual. I really need to be working on my portfolio which is due August 31st. I can't graduate until it is approved - ahhh!   I really have nothing else to report. I am keeping busy with scrapbooking, seeing friends, going to the gym, and procrastinating on writing grad school papers. I will be posting some of my favorite scrapbook pages as soon as I can find a scanner that will scan 12x12 pages. I am going to try Kinko's tomorrow. Yes, that sounds much better than writing a paper or working on my portfolio!
