I just ate at the Lincoln Cafe for the first time, and while we didn't get dessert (we brought our own bright orange Orioles birthday cake), I feel like a dope for not going sooner.  The food was most excellent.  The people were great, and while Ian wasn't working, they all said he was great, too.  The wait staff all had slices of our hideous orange cake and played Graham Parsons on the radio.  Wally the wine-guy from John's was there, and he sent us over a bottle of something good.  The people at the table next to ours ate some cake too, despite the awesome fact that they were BoSox fans.  What a great place.  I like Iowa.  I hope it never goes away.
