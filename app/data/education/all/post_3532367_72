The lady from Personnel got in on the act today. Insistence from my boss that my screen is the cause of headaches at work, meant he referred it to Health & Saftey for an assessment. When she arrived I told her I was an assessor myself, so she asked what the real problem was.  Â  She cited a poor working environment and possible conflicts amongst staff, so I gave her the whole history of my move over here 2 years ago, how it was really poor for 12 months, but is generally OK now, although the idiot who thinks he is boss cannot man manage a paper bag. She said I was showing signs of depression (she used to be a nurse) so I told her about the doctor and the counsellor, although I didn't mention the home issues. She said I should keep a diary - LOL and that I looked shattered and should have the rest of the day off - PMSL
