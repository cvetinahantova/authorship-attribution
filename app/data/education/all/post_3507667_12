Hi there, I wanted to take a moment and thank  urlLink Lisa  for welcoming me on her own blog page. I'm very fond of the chats that we have and empathize with her take on life. Thanks for introducing me into the world o'blog Lisa.  While I'm at it, I wanted to endorse a couple of websites:  For those of you that like computer gaming there is no funnier comic than  urlLink Ctrl-Alt-Del , I strongly recommend reading the first in his archive to the last. Tim Buckley is a very talented artist and his humor is infectious. I used his site and some of his art for my homepage at  urlLink www.geocities.com/spiritmonger2004 .  Another Web Comic that tends to crack me up and is part of my daily routine  is  urlLink Dog Complex , for those of you who  enjoy comics.  Well that's it for today.Â  For those of you who drop in to read up on my  adventures, please feel free to drop me a note and say hi. I enjoy meeting new people.
