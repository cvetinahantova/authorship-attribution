We around here are feeling the stress and challenge of a whole year of being professional with our students. Wow, and what a year it has been! The promise of a good long vacation should beckon to us, drawing us toward blissful rest. NO, oh no. We are done with the regular school year soon, but we are starting an extended year for our students on the following Monday. 4 to 6 weeks more... ugh.       This crew works an 11 month year generally. Vacation time for rejuvenating the spirit and soul is vital. It's hard to take those vacations at times , though, knowing that there will not be a substitute for anyone who is missing. If there is, it is someone from another class, or part of the other staff. This creates a drain in that person's area, or role. I use my vacation time during the time of year that I am not able to work. I am an hourly employee, so extended breaks can kill my financial situation.      Top Five Reasons to Work With Kids:   5 - They think you really are smarter than they are.  4 - It's o.k. to ask them to wash there hands.  3 - Kids love to be outside.  2 - They tell you about all the new movies (R-Movies!)  1 - You can make fun of them, and it goes over their heads.
