OK everybody...  I have read over all your topic suggestions, and here are this week's topics. You should respond to both by this time next week (or during this lesson if you have time). Remember: you are welcome to disagree with people - in fact, I encourage you to - as long as you maintain respectfulness. If you are going to voice an opinion,  always  back it up with reasons.  Your social topic:  Should there be restrictions on the media for the personal privacy of celebrities?   Your  Northern Lights  topic:  What similarities are there between daemons and their person and armour and their bears?    This week (and on a couple of other weeks), there is a special extra topic. This topic is going to be part of my thesis - an exteded research project I'm doing at university. It is:   Considering how much you use computers at home, what should you be learning about in school â€“ the skills involved in how to use computers, or the responsibilities involved in how to use computers?   (And remember: don't just write what you think I want to hear. My personal opinion on this one might not be quite what you think it is...)  cheers,  Zoe
