Yo,        im about to leave for bretts but i figured id write for a second. Last night was alright, i went to a senators game with janelle and there were fireworks afterwards. The game was awesome and the fireworks for unbeleivable. uhhh...thats pretty much it, during the day i just sat around. Today i had a class at hacc for firefighting, and now im obviously about to leave. Tomorrow im going to janelles at like 2-3 to swim and chill all evening like usual, should be very fun and awesome. Well, i guess i'll update tomorrow night. Peace!
