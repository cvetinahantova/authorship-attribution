This is another really quick update as we have extremely limited time left on the internet!  Currently still in Corfu, staying at Kavos...!  Have thought about moving onto Athens for Olympics but surprisingly enough will not be able to get accomodation!  (Unless we want to pay lots of extra money!) So, planning on moving back into Italy for Venice and making our way back to Rome via Verona, Florence, Pisa etc!   Ciao,  Claire and Gemma xxx
