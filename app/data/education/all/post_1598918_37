urlLink The Chronicle: Daily news: 04/05/2004 -- 03 : "U. of Illinois at Springfield Plans Ambitious Effort to 'Mirror' All Classroom Programs Online By DAN CARNEVALE"  I like the approach U of I is taking:    "All on-campus courses and degrees will remain available. The mirror campus is meant to give students the option of taking any course either by going to a classroom or by lounging on a futon with a laptop."
