Eeeeeee giggage. I went to see  urlLink King Adora  with Coz on Friday. The rest of his band was there and I was chatting to them, and they all seem really nice guys. Eeeeee I know a band. Coz told me he'd sent my review to the other 3 band members, until Charlie told me he hadn't got it, as did Jack, so in fact, in Coz's head, 3 must equal 1. Bless 'im. Much "huzzah"ing occurred, as well as much sweatiness do to my innapropriate dress (2 tops). I had a lot of fun, then got invited back to Chillie's house (not by Chillie- again, this is all Coz's fault :D) and rang mum to ask her if I could stay at Coz's (it's near enough) and received a definite no. Boo. So spent a couple of minutes moping before venting some anger on the moshpit. The band were good, too. I haven't heard their album in about 2 years but I remembered I liked their style; they really bring it off in a live setting as well, and I think I might try and get my hands on the new album. Or just copy it off Lucy. Mwahahaha.  Eeeeeee more giggage. Guess who I'm going to see on Thursday *grin* go on *grin* * urlLink guess  *grin* Can't wait *grin* best gig ever *grin* after the last time I saw them *grin* Eeeeeee. *grin* If you think I'm being restrained, you can't actually see me; whenever I think about it my body seems to spasm strangely and I have the urge to jump around the room like a crazy person, which, incidentally, I will be doing on Thursday night. EEEEEEEEEEE.  urlLink *grin*   Ceff x   Whatever turns you on...
