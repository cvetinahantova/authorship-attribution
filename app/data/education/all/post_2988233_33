I jsut got back from Sam's club with 25 lbs of sugar.  Tell me, how am I going to store 25 lbs of sugar?  I haven't got a clue!  But it won't last long.  WE are going thru 4-5 gallons of sweet tea a day.    I feel like I am talking to myself on here.  But it has been so helpful to just ramble on.  Which is basically what I do most of the time.  lol.  It has really helped me work thru this stuff with Tommy.  I mean it is the kind of stuff that you don't really want to discuss with anyone in person, but so need to get it off your chest.  I think God has really directed me to this blog.  Silly sounding I know, but when I started this thing, I was to the point of exploding with all the emotion and confusion going on in my head.  It has been a true release.
