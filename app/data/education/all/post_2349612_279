i've so enjoyed the week so far without having a roommate, that amanda unexpectedly coming back an hour ago throws a damper on the next few days...  yeah she lives here too, but when i left to go sign the lease on my new place, i didn't expect to come home to her with a friend saying "well, so i have a boy coming over tonight, so i moved some of your stuff that was out here, can you move the rest before he gets here?"  i feel cornered... i'm in my room with a book because she's out in the tv room chatting it up with her friend about stuff i'm not really interested in at all.  i need to get over myself and stop complaining... just 2 more weeks really, then i'll be in memphis, then driving cross country, and then the lease will have started on my new place... 2 more weeks...
