So I fly to Myanmar tomorrow morning at 10:15am.  Now that is cool.  I've blogged a lot in the past two days but that might be coming to an end.  I think I won't be able to blog for the duration of my stay there.  I could be wrong but given their current policy on e-mail I doubt it.  I've managed to collect everything I need to go and I'm totally ready.   I slept like  log last night but I need another good night's sleep.  I should probably be asleep already but here I am instead.  I didn't get to watch a movie today but I did go to another museum.  I've pretty exhausted all of them in Bangkok with the exception of one.  I guess I'll save it for when I come back or something.   I hope to be able to write on the other side but in case I can't fairwell for 2 weeks (actually 16 days not counting tomorrow).
