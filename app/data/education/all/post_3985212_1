OK, so I had my interview. I was nervous before I got there....then I got more nervous when I saw this school. Mind you, it is one of 2 Jr. Highs in Merrillville. I pulled up.....looked ahead of me and saw one of the biggest schools I'd ever seen. I was later informed that over 1100 seventh and eigth grade students attend there. Wow! That's a lot of hormones running around! Then....to make my nervousness worse, when I walked in, there were not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 people there to drill me. Great! They were very nice though. I really hope that I get the job. I will know early next week. *fingers crossed* They even asked me to sing for them! Cool!   Signing off.....  Current mood = nervous? excited? I'm not sure!!!!
