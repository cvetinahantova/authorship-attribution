No, the Queen of Egypt hasn't found love, she hasn't even discovered any clues leading to it's hiding place! She just watched the movie  urlLink "Love Actually"  and fallen in love with the concept of falling in love!  It has been a long time since I felt emotionally attached to anyone and watching all of those love stories develop in front of me reminded me of two things:  1. Andrew Lincoln (This Life, Teachers, etc.) is very attractive and worthy of more sites on the internet. 2. It is a wonderful feeling to be in love.  We all hope it will happen to us. Some people give up on it, saying it is a childish dream. That financial security is far more important. Other people live their life waiting for the dream to happen to them. I am the latter. I dream of Mr Right. He must be out there, living his life, oblivious to my whereabouts. One day, our paths will meet. You could call it destiny.   Well, good night to all you dreamers and good night to all the realists. And good night to all those who have found their dream and are happy in their space in the universe.
