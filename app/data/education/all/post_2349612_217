greetings from valpo!  what have i been up to in the past 3 days?  wednesday: was on the road from 7:30am til 7pm... that includes having to pull off the road for half an hour and wait for drugs to kick in to knock out an awful awful headache, but i made it to ohio feeling all better. =)  happy night of good chili, ice cream, and mooovies w/ jenny  thursday: all day at the cincinnati zoo with jenny, then back to her campus and wandering around oxford's "uptown", and playing nintendo til we fell asleep  friday: dinner w/ one of jenny's friends, drove for 4.5 hours, showed up at gellersen (valpo math building) around 2 this afternoon and chatted with prof. gillman for an hour about all the new things going on in the department and he took an opinion poll of what i thought on like 42 other things... the new redone front lobby is pretty snazzy!  and it was good to catch him since he's going out of town tomorrow morning and i wouldn't have seen him the rest of the weekend...  now, in the valpo library with heather schaefer (neighborest heather) in the 8 minutes before they close, deleting junk mail...  got 3 of my 4 grades online -- As in lie groups and algebra, B in graph theory, verdict on analysis isn't in yet -- at least i'm not failing ;)  now dinner and a concert at neighborest heather's church... yay for being back at valpo =)
