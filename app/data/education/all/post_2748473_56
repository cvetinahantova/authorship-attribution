Wow, my mind is really blown. I have found out that many many other people dwell in the same sadness and fear that I go through. Life being such an existential/on my own thing was something I think that as we grow up people begin to feel it and it burns so hard. I am fighting to find a balance on being dependant of other people. That is one of the reasons things probably screwed up with Ashley. I want and something keeps telling me to keep talking to Maggie but I am so heartbroken over last night. She seemed all like "WTF! That's really strange that you are calling me". I don't know. I was hoping to find someone that I knew was a genuine person and find some companionship in. Girls seem to misread me though. I do absolutely not want to get into another dating/relationship thing for a long long time. I think that when I was with Ashley it was what I needed at that time and she helped me get through the roughest part of my life that I have faced, but looking back and looking around me I see how much I just need to take it easy and take care of myself. I guess maybe taking whatever Maggie said however I took it really screwed me up in the head. I had a great time with Katie and Annen tonight and it is so odd to see Annen and realize that an excellent friend is going away, as are almost everyone I trust.     Sometimes we have to take a shot in the dark to find the light. We must go our own ways and do our own things and what is meant to be will  be. The existence of thoughts of what might have been and what actually is will mostly divert and slow down the what is.  I just hope I keep my heart how it is and keep on trucking. I love you all and hopefully I will look back and be grateful for everything. Glad for the bad times that make me stronger, glad for the mistakes that show me the way and glad for a Savior and best friend who eases this sickness in my body.
