I'm feeling the need to break out of my shell today. Must be that BF(ucking -  there ya go, Janet...good idea, actual cursing helps somehow )N this morning, closely followed by AF's pet Spot -- that damn Spot's bite definitely hurts. The signs are telling me that I am out again this cycle, and that I am destined to continue on this ttc journey for a while longer, kicking and screaming if I must...  At any rate, I am ever so grateful for my readership of two ( thank you so much Christine and Janet! ) but I think it's time to stop being so damned shy and go public. I'm not making any big announcement or anything, but we'll see if anyone out there finds this by listing it ( please send me a little shout out and comment just to say hi so I know you're out there if you do find me ) and maybe I'll add a link to my siggy on ivillage.  If you're visiting my blog for the first time, welcome, and thanks for stopping in!    Here's my disclaimer:    I make no promises that this will be remotely interesting or entertaining, but I will be baring my soul, which may sometimes include some hope-inspired blathering and other times some disparaging, pathetic whining about how much this ttc after m/c journey can suck the big banana.  Thanks for reading if you are, and thanks for commenting if you do. If you hate me and my verbal diarrhea, please don't tell me and please don't torture yourself by hanging around. I don't need to be loved by everyone, and I can totally take (and sometimes need) a good well-intentioned cyber bitch-slapping like my good friend Janet is quite adept at doling out, but my occasionally wavering and hormonally shifting self-esteem really doesn't need a beating, either.  If you can stand my drivel, please come back, and let me know you're out there once in a while. Thank you ever so kindly! ;) (Yes, if you can't tell by now, I am a bit of a dork...)
