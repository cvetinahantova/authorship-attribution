There is an insatiable hunger within me that can't be fed anymore with false desires, that can't be stuffed, loaded, drowned, or filled with anything but pure essence - energy from the source of all light.  It's not a stretch to imagine the freedom from delusion, freedom from desire, but god.  Our desires are real and one must eat, but eat well, one must always deal with desire for sexual gratification, have sex with love then.  Because it is in love that all our desires can truly be fulfilled.    I can't help but feel that the daily enactment of this story, that I am a child of light seeking to unite again from that which I came, can only bring me greater freedom, joy, and energy to accomplish anything I set my mind to.  I'm taking steps inward to open my heart and mind to the infinite.  As I ask, so shall I receive and the familiar breeze of awakening gently kisses my consciousness.
