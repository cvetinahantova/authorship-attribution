urlLink Cooperative Learning Strategies and Children. ERIC Digest.  This article discusses how cooperative learning can be used with children.  As most papers of this kind deal with older learners, I thought this might be of interest for those who would like to try this great teaching method with a younger crowd.  From the article:  Cooperative learning is a teaching strategy involving children's participation in small group learning activities that promote positive interaction. This digest discusses the reasons for using cooperative learning in centers and classrooms, ways to implement the strategy, and the long-term benefits for children's education.   WHY TRY COOPERATIVE LEARNING?  Cooperative learning promotes academic achievement, is relatively easy to implement, and is not expensive. Children's improved behavior and attendance, and increased liking of school, are some of the benefits of cooperative learning (Slavin, 1987).   Although much of the research on cooperative learning has been done with older students, cooperative learning strategies are effective with younger children in preschool centers and primary classrooms. In addition to the positive outcomes just noted, cooperative learning promotes student motivation, encourages group processes, fosters social and academic interaction among students, and rewards successful group participation.
