this is not an entry about  urlLink dictionary.com's word of the day servic .   this is not an entry about Andrew's  urlLink everyday life .  this is not a rant about some esoteric  urlLink political issue .  this is not a post about what its like to live in a world where googling leads to misdirection more often than it points us to true north.  this is not a post about the way that misdirection, short attention spans, rabbit trails and esoteria have become more constitutive of the human quest for knowledge than an old school card catalogue.  this is not a blog about how much empathy is required of web-designers who want to create intuitive and inviting web experiences.  this is a post about that poem that robert frost wrote where he was walking in a wood and two paths diverged and he, he took the one less travelled by and it has made all the difference.  and maybe its a post about stumbling through woods and thinking that you're on a path for a moment and then realizing that you're on a *totally* different path than you thought you were.  and then looking backwards at the path you chose and admitting that sure: it has made all the difference...but what the hell path was it...?  (BTW ~ i don't mean to be pedantic, but in order for this blog to make much sense you have to hyperlink the title...just a little last minute  urlLink disambiguation  there...)
