A Brush With   Today, I inadvertently intimidated  urlLink Mo Rocca .  It's not much of a story, but the highlights:  narrow hallway, large man (me), skinny man (Rocca) standing in the way.  I said, "excuse me," and he got all flustered.  I decided not to acknowledge his Rocca-ness, because really, he knows who he is and I didn't have a lot to say about it.  When I was in college, I hooked up with a girl who claimed to have slept with  urlLink Eddie Spaghetti  but who knows if it was true.  I wonder if she told that to all the guys, and for that matter, why that is something she would tell to all the guys.  I said hi to  urlLink Peter Wolf  on the street once (he waved back), and my sister used to work in a north end restaurant frequented by members of  urlLink Extreme  and Aerosmith.  My dad is inexplicably chummy with  urlLink K.C. Jones  for reasons involving the 1970s that I will never fully understand.  All I know is that, if we're talking about people who end up on national television, Mo Rocca is probably the best I've ever done, and I can't help but feel deficient for that.  And I kind of resent feeling deficient for that.
