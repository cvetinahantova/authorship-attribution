We went to see  urlLink Spiderman 2  last night.  I'm a sucker for superhero films anyway but loved this one.  Sam Raimi injects just enough black humour for my taste.     I found my self identifying with the theme of sacrifice for a higher calling. Should I be worried about such superhero/lone-ranger tendencies? Apparently not, says the  urlLink LiCC review
