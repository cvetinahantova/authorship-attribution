This is a new day and I have a new focus and direction.  The commission only sales position at ADT lasted 7 weeks.  I believe that this would have been a possibility after building the business for 6 months to a year.  The only problem with my remaining active in this role is that my finances just wont allow me to do it.  I need income now and not six months from now.  Economics forced my hand and now I am back to the drawing board looking for a job with a paycheck attached to it.    Wish me luck!
