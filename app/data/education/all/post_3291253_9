Well... cheking this site out :  urlLink www.gmailswap.com  I found out that supposedly if I were an active blogger in this site, I was going to be invited for a gmail account. But to my luck, I wasn't. I then thought that because I was a Mexican and I put that in my profile I wasn't being invited. It's so obnoxiuos when geographical specific content is offerd in sites. My latest outrage was when I wanted to check out the episodes of the not so popular animated series of The Clone Wars that in my country appear on the cartoon network (I'm not bothering to create links for this things, that goes to show you that I am still indignated). Well I connected to the cartoon network site and when I tried to watch the damn cartoos, that I don't even like that much anyway, the browser spewed out somehting like  "This content is not authorized for your region" . How about that? Sucks. Well anyway, I hope that my offer for a free translation of documents in the site will prompt anyone for a gmail swap.   I don't think that's going to happen.
