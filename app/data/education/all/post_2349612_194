man, i hate starting sticky situations... i need to tell amanda i plan to live with leigh and colleen next year and she should look for another roommate for starting in september... it shouldn't be a big deal, ya know?  but every time i see her we start talking about other stuff and i feel bad changing the topic... one of these days... it's not that she's a bad roommate... i just need to live with math people... blah.
