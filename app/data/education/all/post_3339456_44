There are a number of  urlLink organizations  that in name sound quite appealing, but in reality, are actually fronts for right wing anti-peace, anti-human rights, or anti-environment organizations.  Here is one example.  the  urlLink Foundation for Defense of Democracies  descirbes itself as nonpartisan.  Nice try.  If you look at the names of the people behind the organization, a number of them, if not the majority, are neoconservatives, including Newt Gingrich, James Woolsey, Bill Kristol, and Richard Perle.  Go to the biography page, then search for more info on these characters on  urlLink google .
