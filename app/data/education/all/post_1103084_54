- RETRACTION NUMBER TWO (ish) -    Why have I been moved over to the NEW blogger posting box? Not a fan.  I like seeing MORE not LESS info on my screen.   This is public retraction 2 of the day, but I just wrote a long email psuedo-retracting an even longer conversation -- if i had a fortune cookie today it would say something like: You're life will be better off if you can undo breaking open this cookie..  Public Retraction Two:  urlLink David, my brother , is far more orderly, organized & Steven Covey Worthy than I am.    Which maybe made the whole thing about his a-futurism ( a new religion, perhaps?) so bizarre.   And lest you think that I spit in the eye of the sovreignity of God -- worrying, as I do, about what the morrow brings -- let me assure you that I *do* trust in the sovreignity of God, but I also trust that the sovreignity of God is partly responsible for my over-active need to DO. to MAKE. to ACHIEVE.  Right?  No?   It's late.  GregGibbs was here. Tonight.  Out of the blue.  Rich, deep, fun talks.  Always.  peace~
