Cluster news   Well, it seems like things are turning out better for the cluster. We won't have to go through the hub anymore to purchase equipment, because they f*cked up on their responsibilities twice in a row, giving us a price without even checking if they could actually get the hardware. So now we're speccing out the workstations, we're going to purchase the parts from Axiontech because out of all the crap out there on the internet they're the least likely to earf*ck us with the orders.  Charles started working for Scott on Wednesday, so we'll be stealing him for lackey work. And Philip Tilton e-mailed Evan saying that he wanted to volunteer and work at the cluster, so if he turns out to be a decent worker I might train him to take up my job after I leave.
