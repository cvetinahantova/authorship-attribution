urlLink    This summer has been an oasis of joy.  The cool temperatures have, I'm sure, been a part of that feeling of contentment, but mostly it's because I have been aware of how happy I am.   My husband and children, my home, the wonderful people in my life, my faith, the beauty of the countryside - I have never felt so completely content.  A feeling of joy makes my heart overflow with grateful appreciation to God for all the love that surrounds me.   I've been through some hard times in my life.  I guess that's why I recognise and appreciate the good times when they come.
