Well folks, tonight is the night. Its Van Halen time. Yes that's right, and man have I been waiting for it. I have had a bitchen migraine for the past 2 days, and I have been praying to God everynight that he will let me be headache free for tonight, so he better answer that prayer, God dammit! Sara and I are going; she's not as big a Van Halen fan as me, but Mama said, "take whoever you would have the most fun with" and that is mostdef Cer. So headache or not we are goin to Dance the Night Away. So I met the new chicks who moved in next door and they're cool as hell and excited to be at SC. I invited them to the party that we are having on Saturday night, the party in which we are not allowed to have according to our renters agreement. So hopefully I wont get evicted. But I have a good story planned already for Robin if in case I do get caught. I realize this is a lot of reading for all of you college kids, probably more than you ever do all year, so my rambling is finished....for now.  Muuuhahahahahaaaaaaa. (Don't ask, I just went with it).
