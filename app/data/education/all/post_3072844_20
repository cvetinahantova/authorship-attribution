Phew! *sigh* *slump*  This is the time of day where i fall off my feet and onto my sofa, with a sigh and a cup of tea, thankful that this day has nearly come to an end. Mondays are always like that, but i suppose that today  is  the longest day of the year.  This is the time of day where i stick on some music (Blink 182), drink (the cup of tea), log on and browse my email and the internet for a while. A while becomes ages. I begin to think about the RE homework i didn't do yesterday and have to do for tomorrow, the English 800-2000 word draft of creative writing which was supposed to be in today, and has now to be in on wednesday, the music project i haven't started which is supposed to be presented tomorrow...  And every night i just go around doing nothing in particular because there's the weight of homework, piano / clarinet practice, and other work for people that i haven't done yet hanging over me, and in the end i usually go to bed having done absolutely nothing, then do the homework during breakfast the next morning. It's a funny routine.  I wonder if i can snap out of it; do something different, something productive tonight. It always makes me feel better when i have actually done, or finished, something! Well, for now there's my website - madnosity.com - and that i think i'll work on. Get some stuff done. When it's finished, i'll keep you posted!
