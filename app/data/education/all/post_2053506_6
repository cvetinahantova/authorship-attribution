I am still working on my ruana. Slow but steady.    I heard someone at work say that they thought maybe ponchos were popular nowadays.  Duh!  I interrupted and told her I have tons of cool patterns and plan to make one in the fall.  She seemed a little taken aback. Like, for real??  Yes. I think people and fashion is an interesting combination.  The way people dress says a lot about their character.  I couldn't even *see* her wearing a poncho.  She'll be envious when she sees mine though.  I bet she'll even be jealous of my ruana.  So there.
