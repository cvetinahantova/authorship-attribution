this day couldn't suck any more than it did...  fisrt, i found out that the badminton club of our school is totally useless. then my grandma used the internet and i wasn't able to talk to jammi...man, i'm so itching to tell him i love him.  *** ms. rubio was really pissed off today. i heard a girl named aretha from I4 wrote in a paper that ms. rubio had no sense of style and she's trying so hard to speak english. i heard she was on the verge of tears when she was scolding aretha. actually, i don't feel sorry for she. she kinda deserves it fo feeling too comfortable. but then again, maybe it was unfair of us to treat her like that. but she should cut us some slack, too.
