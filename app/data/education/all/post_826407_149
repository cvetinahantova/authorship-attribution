Don't you hate it when you realise your not as sorted as you thought?  I stayed away from Heidi Baker on Monday.  I used my work at school (parents evening the day after) as an excuse but really I was just too scared.  The thing was that I couldn't face being in a room again where everyone else was being got by God and nothing was happening to me.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a diss on St. Tom's or Heidi or The Holy Spirit but rather a confession.  I couldn't deal with having to smile and laugh along with people who were affected in a way I've never understood cog I've rarely experienced.  I wasn't prepared to run the risk of feeling inadequate because I'm still standing still and rehearsing excuses in my head; its happened to many times before.  And I don't have a problem with any of this stuff happening.  I know its God's power moving on us.  In my head I agree with  urlLink Matt  and  urlLink Ruth 's comments about it all recently.  But still I stayed away.   I thought I had got past this by now, I was sure that I was secure enough in God to allow him to challenge me like this, apparently not. So I guess like Israel at Sinai I let my insecurities get in the way of a powerful experience of God.    I don't want to be in the way of what you're doing God  I want to grow God. I want to change. I want to risk.  Have mercy on me.  (I'm really not sure whether this is something I should or want to post, its kinda personal confessionally.  But a part of me wants to make this weakness public so I might risk it.  Please come back to me if I overstep any lines).
