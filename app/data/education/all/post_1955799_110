Hello all,  I broke my glasses.  I'm so upset!  I'll have to make an appointment for Thursday top get my eyes examined, and a new pair.  Right now I tried using some glue, but that didn't work.  When the opportunity presents itself, I'm getting some contacts, so if I run into problems, I can switch out.    A friend told me that she's having a bad spot with another friend.  She has a solution, and I hope it works out.  Let's hope things stay calm.
