Finally, tomorrow I'm starting! I'm SO Exited! I already want to be here. New people, new place, new way of life... i know everything will be great! I already meet a few people this 3 days of conference. G2G, dad is complaining on us doing nothing and then asking for things... wow, like if I ask for things. I never ask for anything. i just wait o receibe my own money and use it so i don't ask them anything. Shees *roll eyes* My dad is always like that. I hate that. (not him)
