hello,  well i went to a fun cool place last night with a group of friends.   actually, two places the first was H1, very cool.  all of you artist on the  list would have loved it.  anyway... the second was a place called zantika  which was also very cool.  i liked it because i finally felt like i was  hangin' where thai people hang.  everyone was dancing to a mixture of music  which was unfortunately bad american pop, but still it was loads of fun.   thai people seem to all dance the same to me. it is very fast and i just  can't move my body that quickly.  anyway... they all thought i was dancing  crazy so they laughed but i didn't care.  anyway... i was there with aurora  (from oregon hippie parents whole name aurora dawn wood)  she attempted to  teach me a few salsa moves. i think i was a poor student.  at least i tried.  well other than that... i was thinking of a few things that i miss about the  states.  1. jon stewart  2. driving  3. good music  4. all you guys  gotta run.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Planning a family vacation?
