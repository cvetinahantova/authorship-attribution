man im gonna have 2 listen 2 this song so much now...and all the other dashboard songs 2 jus 2 keep me from shootin myself...man this sux so much...and 4 sum reason i knew this wud happen...i wuz hoping it wudnt but i knew it wud...i knew this wudnt work out...it never does...i got a lot of stuff 2 go do...SAMMY SOSA IN THE HOMERUN DERBY ALL THE WAY...4 those who care...l8r  JT  4 those of u who dont kno the lyrics these are them...and most of em xplain how i feel right now...especially the bolded 1s   So this is odd,  The painful realization  That all has gone wrong  And nobody cares at all,  And nobody cares at all.    So you buried all your lover's clothes  And burned the letters lover wrote,  But it doesn't make it any better.  Does it make it any better?  And the plaster dented from your fist  In the hall where you had your first kiss  Reminds you that the memories will fade.   So this is strange,  Our sidestepping has come to be  A brilliant dance  Where nobody leads at all,  Where nobody leads at all.    And the picture frames are facing down  And the ringing from this empty sound  Is deafening and keeping you from sleep.  And breathing is a foreign task  And thinking's just too much to ask  And you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.    Well, this is incredible.  Starving, insatiable,  Yes, this is love for the first time.  And you'd like to think that you were invincible.  Yeah, well weren't we all once  Before we felt loss for the first time?  Well this is the last time.
