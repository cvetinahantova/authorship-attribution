11pm: here's lara, being a bum and dozing off early  11:15pm: phone call with "unidentified number" on the caller ID -- i answer and seriously it sounds like marcus dugan (tammy's husband)... so i was entirely confused for a minute, but you guessed it -- travis, aka "black death"  we talked for the last hour that he was at work (he's a pizza chef :-P)... and for his drive home... and for a bit after... 2.5 hours in all.  it was highly entertaining despite the fact that i'm braindead and was nearly asleep when the conversation started  what does one talk about for 2.5 hours?  pizza... shoes... movies... ohio... gambling... more movies... tv... "hey here's a question that's more random than the last one you asked"... it was fun...  and if i type out the scott reaction now, then none of you will have to be ridiculous and say it "dude, 2.5 hours?  soo, you engaged yet?"... ha ha...  whatever, but at least now, i can stop worrying about how tuesday will go, because if we can have a quality chat for 2.5 hours (just before his phone died, BD was like "so, this is the longest intelligent conversation i've had in months -- thanks!"), we'll be fine for lunch.  anywho... i was going to crash 3 hours ago... maybe now i will for real -- night y'all. =P
