ANTIGUA TIME i was planning to climb up volcano pacaya today, but that might have to wait for later in the week.  out of the dozens of places taking groups up the volcano, mine cancelled the trip this afternoon while i was waiting and missed the chance to hook up with another place.  suck.  oh well.  i�m going to catch the rest of england vs. portugal world cup qualifing match with a couple of irish guys i met last night.  it�s halftime now. last night i walked around antigua with this german chick, Dalia, i met at the hostel.  she was one of those people that you tend to meet while traveling that is cool to hang out with for about a day then after that could be annoying.  it�s great.  i know i�ll only be around certain people for a few hours so i can be best friends with about anybody for that amount of time. i slept in today until 10.  i felt a bit guilty, since im in guatemala and all and need to explore everything, but i was tired. antigua is a dope place, cobblestone streets, ruins, old stuff.  i like it.  but i think i need to head out to lago atitlan tomorrow for some chill, do nothingness.
