Ok well. I went up to Johnny's, and everyone was their normal asshole self. I didn't get to be alone with him AT ALL. It is SOO hot outside, All of his brothers are jerks and never ever ever leave him alone, so all I did was watch him play Baseball. It was soo fucking gay. AND he has to fucking work tomorrow so I cant see him outside of school. This whole being in love thing sucks. I think maybe Justine is getting through to him. IDK but I hate her soo soo soo soo much. I just wanna kill her! err!! fuck idk. Maybe he will get online, and we can actually talk about stuff, just him and I. And plus it is easier to talk when you don't have to actually face him. Well. I'm out for now. Peace    I LOVE JOHN
