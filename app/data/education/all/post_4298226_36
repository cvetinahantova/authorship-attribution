We started our journey a year ago We shared our moments  We lend each other’s shoulder to cry on We laughed together We fought together We dreamt, wished and hoped together  No days went by without talking on the line Talking about everything we went through that day  Each day filled with Greetings, stories and secrets From you to me  We lived separately But I felt so close to you  A year has passed….. Look at us now  It’s like we just met On the street And introduced ourselves again  I don’t even know you anymore And I even find myself don’t know who I am…  I start to question us The question that never been asked before
