I read these to remember my religious roots and why I have chosen a different path. I found this  urlLink here . The  urlLink first  one is rather interesting too.       The females are in love with themselves. They want to be males.   They think they will find fulfillment in their fake freedom of women's lib.  They will only find fulfillment in loving devotion to the pleasure of men. MEN not males.  But American males have not fulfilled their duty and God has allowed this women's lib stuff to come upon us as a judgement, a punishment to chastize us to repent.    I can almost understand the reasoning for the first two - I won't bother to expound, however. The last two...what the f***? Didn't Paul admonish singles to stay single? More or less he said marriage was a pain in the ass and should be avoided unless your sex drive was uncontrolable? Women's lib is God's punishment to men or women? I'm not sure I understand.
