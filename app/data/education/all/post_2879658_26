Passover       So this morning I called home to say hello and to have a couple of questions answered.  Little did I know that at that moment my family and some of our closest family friends would be sitting down to begin the Passover Seder.  I chatted briefly with my mom and then my brother before having to allow them to return to the festivities.  Being so wrapped up in life in Japan, where I am going from here, and just day to day things, you sometimes forget about certain times when the rest of your family(or part of your family) is getting together and that in fact you are missing more things then you may have really considered.    Having been in Japan for over 8 months, I have missed seeing my neice grow from when she was about 10 weeks old to now almost a year.  I have missed holidays, weddings of family friends, birthdays, and I am sure this list goes on and on.  However I have also realized that perhaps this year has been an invaluable experience for me as I ventured to a quite unfamiliar world, have learned a bit of the language, lived completely alone for the first time ever, and have been able to support myself in the lifestyle that I want.       Anyway, I am not really sure where I am going with this except for perhaps that I want everyone back in the U.S. to realize that I am thinking about all of you, what you are up to, the things that I am missing as a result of my quest for adventure, etc..
