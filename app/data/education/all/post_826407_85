Came back from a few days in Pembrokshire with Helen and a few friends. I had an excellent time, lots of Castles, monasteries, beaches, seals, fires, food and drink and the perfect antidote to the previous few months.  Half Terms are great!!!  Thanks guys.  One of the places we visited was  urlLink St Govan's Chapel , a small chapel carved into cliffs in a very rocky cove.  Its named after a 6th Century Hermit and monk who lived for most of his life there (after he was chased by Pirate's, so the legend goes) worshipping and praying.  It was bleakly beautiful and fired my imagination.       While we were there messing around on the rocks a seal came swimming up to us.  It was fascinating to watch and seemed so playful weaving above and below the surface.          More photos will follow  Journey home was long - our fan belt went (again) outside Aberystwyth and had to be replaced (what is it with us and travel) So we were driving back all the twisty Snowdonia roads in the dark and wet.  Kinda fun.
