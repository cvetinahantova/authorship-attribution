today is my first meeting with my tenure and promotion committee -- hence the silence for the last little while.  The front burner is dominating.    Actually lots of little backburners are going and going strong, but I don't have time to write them into community...  sorry to all whose email remains unanswered -- hopefully *part 2* of my week will yield a little more connection - time.  my brother turned me on this blogger quiz -- I'm not usually about such quizzes -- but I must admit bloggings been a bit of an obsession for the last few months.    the whole experience has illumined for me, though, a little bit, how and when i'm devoted to face to face.  When i do and don't feel okay about making personal boundaries.    but i'd better stop...i'm launching into a little burner.  don't have time.  gotta work on appendix 2A B -- dealing with Criterion 2 a. (2.) (f.) -- gotta love life in bureaucracy...  HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANGELA! (my little sister -- not so little any more is turning twenty two, buying a house and succeeding at her first real job.  Well she hasn't said she's succeeding -- but -- c'mon! She's a Rudd!)
