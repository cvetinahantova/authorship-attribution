You ain't seen nothin' yet:   urlLink News : "You may think that computers have taken over most aspects of your life. But you ain't seen nothing yet. It's predicted that in 20 years' time, 'there will be 100 times more computers, each 100 times more powerful than now. They will be everywhere - in toys, in books, in clothes, under our skin, in chairs, in pills. They will be connected by wireless at 100 times today's speed. Their programs, however, will still be hand-crafted, and subject to continuous change.' That's the view of Sir Tony Hoare, previously Professor of Computer Science at Oxford University and now a researcher at Microsoft's Research Lab in Cambridge. He wants fellow computer scientists to think about how to handle this scary new world."
