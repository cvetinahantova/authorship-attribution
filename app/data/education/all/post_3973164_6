Bob, this is entirely your fault and I shall be grateful to you for as long as I can remember to be. I tried to post a very un-witty comment on Bob's blog and realized I had two choices to make that happen. Create my own blog or post anonymously...well, I have never been a big fan of anonymous anything...my own blog it is. Bob, thank you for making my dream come true, I now have a blog. If you had never said that Gauloises were horrible I would never have felt the need to correct you. I smoked those things for 8 months while living in France. I owe them a good deal of my sanity.     I am now embarking on a new adventure...work. I will soon be gainfully employed by an established learning institution in the moderately great state of Missouri. Somehow I convinced a group of educated men and women that I will be a good role model for and educator of high school boys. It is an all-boys boarding school. Perhaps my acting abilities have taken me farther than I should have gone. Nevertheless, I am slowly getting used to the idea of being self-sufficient, getting up for work everyday, living in my own place, driving my own car, smoking behind buildings so not to be a bad influence on young men.     In the meantime, I will finish my carefree days with Amber...living the vida loca...I'll make you take your clothes off and go dancing in the rain, make no mistake.
