OK, I totally suspect Brittany Murphy of being a teen idol.  That said, I think her quote just about sums things up:  "First it's denial, then devastation. Then it's the tears, and then after that it's the chocolate. Then it becomes ambivalence and you get your anger, your fight up. Then you're back on your feet again, and you've learned, hopefully, a new lesson in life." --Actress BRITTANY MURPHY telling the New York Daily News about the stages of a romantic breakup.
