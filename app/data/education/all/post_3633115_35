Darnit.  The team I was most pulling for was eliminated tonight.  I don't know why I was pulling for them so much, but I was.  Now I suspect that either Chip and Kim or Cami and Carli  will end up winning, just because they annoy the hell out of me.   Okay so now I'm rooting for Mirna and Charla though I swear her (Mirna's) whininess is going to make me want to slap her through the tv screen. Mirna at the beginning..."come on Charla this is a race." Like Charla forgot about that on her few hours of sleep she may have gotten.  Or maybe the fact that she was in Argentina escaped her consciousness.  Silly. Really.  Still a great show though!  I cannot believe how into this I get!
