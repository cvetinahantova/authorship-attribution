great. i go and edit my profile and i discover i'm born in the year of the horse. the horse?! this is silly. it needs changing. if only i was born another year...*daydreams about what life would be like if i was one year older or younger*...anyway, i was appaled. i'm going to throw this open. what year were you born in on the chinese calendar and what do you think of this. i would like any fellow horses to share their feelings about this. cos i'm feeling a little pecked off to say the least. horse?!!! nooooo! i mean, what are they good for? big teeth, swishy tails, poo...this is not my life! this is not my future! nooooo!
