urlLink John Adams  This us a nice biography of President John Adams.  It is from  urlLink USA Presidents .  From the site:  John Adams ( October 30 , 1735 - July 4 , 1826 ) was the first ( 1789 - 1797 ) Vice President of the United States , and the second ( 1797 - 1801 ) President of the United States .  Adams was born on October 30 , 1735 in what is now the town of Quincy, Massachusetts . His father, a farmer, also named John, was a fourth generation descendant of Henry Adams, who emigrated from Devon , England , to Massachusetts about 1636 ; his mother was Susanna Boylston Adams.   Young Adams graduated from Harvard College in 1755 , and for a time taught school at Worcester and studied law in the office of Rufus Putnam. In 1758 , he was admitted to the bar. From an early age he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men. The earliest of these is his report of the argument of James Otis in the superior court of Massachusetts as to the constitutionality of writs of assistance. This was in 1761 , and the argument inspired him with zeal for the cause of the American colonies. Years later, when he was an old man, Adams undertook to write out, at length, his recollections of this scene; it is instructive to compare the two accounts.
