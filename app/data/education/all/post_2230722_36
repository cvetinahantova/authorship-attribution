Civil rights issues should not be put on the ballot. ... How is my marriage under attack if two gays or lesbians down the street want to make a lifelong commitment to themselves ... Love is bigger than government. Government should not have the right to tell you who you fall in love with and who you want to spend your life with. ... I don't like it when I see human rights violated. ... We are not the Hetero States of America. America should be inclusive, not separating."  --Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura speaking against the proposed Massachusetts constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, in an appearance at the Massachusetts Statehouse, March 22.  ************  "Gay marriage is simply not a civil rights issue. It is not a struggle for freedom. It is a struggle of already free people for complete  social acceptance and the sense of normalcy that follows thereof -- a struggle for the eradication of the homosexual stigma. Marriage is a goal because, once open to gays, it would establish the fundamental innocuousness of homosexuality itself. Marriage can say like nothing else that sexual orientation is an utterly neutral human  characteristic, like eye-color. Thus, it can go far in diffusing the homosexual  stigma."  --Shelby Steele writing in The Wall Street Journal, March 18.  *****************  "The fundamentalist Christians and the Catholic Church and the Republicans and the Bob Jones University assholes and the Fox media guys, they're not fun to hang around with. They're mean, and you can't have a normal conversation with them. So why bother?"  --Queer As Folk's Hal Sparks (Michael) to The Advocate, March 30.
