I would like to take this opportunity to thank Spencer for staying up to 12:30 tonight to explain sports to me.  I would also like to take this time to thank everyone who has taken the time to explain sports to me, like Josh and David.  Working with these guys has been really nice and a true learning experience in all fields.  I know...you're all like "It's no big deal.  We're cool with it," but I am very sentimental and appreciate everything, so I like to thank people.  I know that I wouldn't be half the guy I am now...and i'm being serious, if I didn't have you guys to (on a funny note) prove wrong (lol) and to keep pushing me to learn new things.  Like I said...just wanting to thank everyone while I can. (I get this strange feeling I've done this before...have I? If so..sorry!) If I get..."Bitchy," just slap me and tell me to move on...I'll get the picture!
