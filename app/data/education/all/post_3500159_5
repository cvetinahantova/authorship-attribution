Tonight I met one of my new students.  Yes he has some brain damage, but he understands right and wrong and knows what is expected of him.  He came into my class, rolled around on the floor, screamed at his parents, hit his baby sister, threw cars, etc....This is not the first child I have taught who was like this.  Do you think 4 minutes of time out will do this one any good?  Nope!  It sets him off more.  When my boys were little I never would have put up with rude, disrespectful behavior and yet these days it seems to be the norm.  The kids I teach are special ed, however, we have MANY who are very bright children who know how to manipulate better than any adult.  I am just thankful I don't have to LIVE with those kids!
