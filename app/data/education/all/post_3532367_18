Another of those questions off the doctor and one which perhaps goes someway to answering comments. When I feel bad about something I've done, does it have a stronger feeling than the high?  Well at the moment no, the high lasts for longer and is more powerful, whilst the low is very intense but may only last a couple of minutes - usually while admitting to it!!!!   Take the speakers, every time I get in the car I get a high from the music they produce as a good sharp, clear sound. That is more frequent than the low I got from hiding the boxes in the dustbin or admitting my actions to the doctor. Also the high was experienced both before and after the low and thus cancelled out the feeling of being low - does that make sense?   Sex with Sharon was the same, I was OK at the time, OK after, but felt bad when admitting it to the blog or doctor, but OK again next time I spoke to her on chat.
