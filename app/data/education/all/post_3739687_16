hello all,  well things are going pretty good here.  i'm still substitute teaching this week.  it's going o.k. they actually had me paired up with another teacher, vicky, to help teach first graders how to sew.  like i said befor these nuns are nuts.  anyway... my only complaint at the moment is that i get told what to do by several different people and all of them contracdict each other.  i just do what i think is best for the girls.  i have had one problem student the same one as yesterday.  she has some sort of emotional problem and i was told by everyone (the first time i've heard a general consensus) that as long as she is not being a major disruption in the class to just let her do whatever she wants.  since she wasn't yelling at me in thai today i let her color instead of do her homework.  well i'm playing basketball this afternoon with some of the other teachers.  i'm looking forward to being on the court again.  it's been awhile.  i'm sure i won't last long.  maybe i can talk them into playing horse instead of a full court game.  anyway... someone sent me a comment about having an advantage over the other teachers because of my height.  well this isn't going to happen.  i'm playing against western teachers male and female and  only one of them is shorter than i am.  actually i'm even intimidate by her because she is actually i good shape.  oh well i'll let you know how it went tomorrow.  wish me luck.  hopefully i just won't sprain anything.  love ya'll.  jane
