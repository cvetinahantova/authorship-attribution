Just a quick moment to say, I'M BACK! That's right, the office cannot make me remove this web blog, it has nothing to do with my campaign for a student government office. Although even if I was going to make one about that I'm not entirely sure they could even take it down then, I have a task force looking into the legality of Michelle Yankee's decision. Anyway, back to the point, this web blog is not here for my own self gain, it's here for yours. I hope that this web blog can put an end to all the "What does our class do anyway?" This blog is here to keep our class office holders, and our student body on the same page. With each blog I post, there will be an opportunity for you to get your voice heard by posting a comment, If you would rather just ask me a question without going through the site feel free to e-mail me. Once I figure out how to add links to the blog, there will be a mail link to my e-mail address. There isn't much here yet, but check back daily for more posts.
