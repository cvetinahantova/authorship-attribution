urlLink Emerging Challenges for Community Colleges. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Pam Schuetz.  From the ERIC Digest:  In just over a century, the American community college system has expanded from a single institution to over one thousand colleges serving almost half of all students enrolled in public higher education. While community colleges have adapted successfully to waves of changes over the years, a unique combination of demographic and socioeconomic changes predicted for the next decade promises to challenge the resilience of these low-cost, open-access institutions.   This digest is drawn from "Next Steps for the Community College" (New Directions for Community Colleges, Spring 2002) and summarizes three overlapping challenges facing colleges in the coming decade: educating a more diverse student body, assessing student outcomes, and maintaining the educated workforce needed to meet the increasingly complex needs of the students and institutions.
