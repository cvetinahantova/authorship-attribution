urlLink Help!    Gah! I just want the next two weeks to be  over ! Two presentations, three papers, and the friggen project. Bleh. Hopefully everything will be going on a downward slope after that. Well at least I'm not suffering from the cold anymore. It's still there, mind you, but I'm not suffering, and that's the important part.  It snowed on Thursday. And on Friday. Not to mention the horrible, horrible wind. Or should I call it a gale? It better be Spring soon.
