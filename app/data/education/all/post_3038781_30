Remember Me?   I barely do. I've been so wrapped up in working on my final project for Marketing Management 551- A marketing audit for my own business... that I have let everything get behind. Particularly my Email. When I checked last night, my care2 email account said that I have 5770 kb of messages. unfortunately my account setting is limited to 3000! I'll spend weeks cutting it down.  But on  the upside ...  at least I know I'm loved. Thanks e-Telemarketers!
