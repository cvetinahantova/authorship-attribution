This is exactly where I am right now.  Except I am sitting in the chair instead of Andy.  It's Matt and Andy's room in the Bayou.  I hang out at the Bayou a lot. Go to the gallery  urlLink here  to see more pictures of the bayou.  Matt, Andy, and Jesse live here.  It's where I write.  The band is on tour now and I am wearing Matt's coat.  Don't tell him.
