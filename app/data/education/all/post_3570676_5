Chapter 7 in my Sixth Grade Math book (Prentice Hall) and also Chapter 7 in my Community College text (Basic College Mathematics) both deal with statistics. As the word "statistics" scares students of all ages, I plan to use these three sites as a fun way to introduce the concepts of   mean, median,   and   mode   to my students.   Weather Today by BBC Education (Activity, Fact Sheet, ONLINE test)  Of the three sites, this is the easiest, giving very simple explanations and easy problems. I would use this as either the starting point for everyone or as an effective remediation tool for those who do not grasp concepts easily. urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/revisewise/maths/data/   AAA Statistics This site is my second choice because it moves students up a level. First they see a mini lesson, then they scroll down to a practice area where their reponses are given immediate feedback. Within this same framework is a series of "beat the clock" games to challenge learners further. Lastly, even greater ability can be coaxed from the student as he/she decides whether to perform   mean, median,    or   mode   as 1,2, or 3 digit operations. urlLink http://www.aaamath.com/B/sta.htm   Train Race Activity  by BBC Maths File ( need to use own calculator with this)  This site ranks as my highest level due to the applicational level of requirement. Students must know their terms as no lessons are offered, then they must determine central tendencies of trains in order to place their passenger on the CORRECT train before it departs the station. Overall, the highest orders of thinking are applied to this game.   urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/mathsfile/shockwave/games/train.html
