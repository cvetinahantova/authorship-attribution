'Twas a great weekend I did indeed had and I am starting to feel more and more like myself everyday. I feel kind of lost because I dunno where I am going to be in my life but I know everything is gonna be taken care of. I gotta stop planning stuff out. I think me having my wreck was a reminder from God that I gotta trust Him with everything and not to try to fall back on anything but Him. I also am looking at if how I view things and people in the past were accurately. If situations and relationships were healthy in an overall tone or not and I feel that i made things out to be things that they weren't. I am also getting pressured into getting into this dating business by myself with mixed emotions, and friends and stress and my sister telling me to move on from the last "loser" I was seeing. Ugh. I dunno. I just don't really wanna deal with anyone's crap and I notice myself falling for people and I wanna not screw up friendships that I already have. Oh well, just whatev. I need to get some things talked through with some of my peeps at school but unfortunately I gotta go to the doctor with my eye, which by the way I hope will get better. Well, I am tired and just in a blah kinda monetone melancholy mood sore as crap still but......to bed I must go.    Oh yes, thank you to all of you who have made a difference in my life. you are very dear to me and although I know I am an ackward person at times and a bitty, thanks for all of your support and putting up with me through all my sillyness and sadness and mostly sadness and me fighting myself this past year. I love you all, yes even those of you who piss me off, so don't think otherwise. lol.    MUCH LOVE!!!!
