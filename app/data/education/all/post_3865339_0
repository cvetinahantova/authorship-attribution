This article was interesting in that it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the Internet.  I agree with a lot of what was said in the article about the use of the internet, the influeces it has on children, and the responsibilities of the schools to ensure students safe use of the internet.  It was not surprising to know how children use the internet, but it was surprising to read that some think the internet is frightening.  The reasons given for that fear would make any person weary of using the internet for anything.  Children use the internet for games, e-mail, instant meassaging, and to find music.  Students are unaware of how to really use the internet to gather information for use in the classroom.  It is the responsibility of schools and parents, especially, to teach children how to use the internet responsibly and safely.         It is important for educators to be aware of what knowledge of the internet children bring into the classroom.  The article influences my views of technology in the classroom by increasing my awareness of how important it is for schools to include technology in the curriculum.  It also made me aware of the steps educators need to take to form and enforce the neccessary policies to ensure correct use of the internet inside and outside of the classroom.  I think that the article reinforces my views on how technology is important enough to include in the curriculum due to society becoming more technology-based.
