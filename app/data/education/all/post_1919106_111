2004   Well, it's really just another number. But things as small as a number can mean a lot to us. They announce new chances, and we use them as closure for old issues. If there is any magic in numbers then these are it - the magic is not in the number itself, but in how we think of them. Happy new year everybody, and may The Lady's blessings go with you all.
