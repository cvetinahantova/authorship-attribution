I was almost finished. Ten more minutes and I would have been long gone. They didn't look like the kind of people that would be capable of the kind of stupidity they exhibited. A normal looking dude, his sister and a friend of hers.  The friend went over and put some songs and came back and the guy said he didn't know why she bothered they would probably be gone by the time her songs came on. Then "Hello, I love You" came on and the dude says, Man I hate the Doors, they are such a copycat band, have you ever noticed how all their songs sound like somebody else.  The girl said no she hadn't and that she kind of liked them. He proceeded to say how they sounded like this band or that band and I could not help thinking what a dweeb he was since most of the bands he named did not begin recording until after the Doors.  He then went on to say how he really hated how bassy they sounded.  I was getting up to leave anyway so as I passed the dude I punched him straight down on top of his head, which made him bite off a small piece of his tounge.  He and his companions just sat stunned and so I payed and left with my pal Cheese.  When we got to the car Cheese said, I don't know why you punched that guy, you freaking hate the Doors.  I said, I know but I hate them for the right reason.
