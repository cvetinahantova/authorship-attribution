or at least thats how i feel today when i accidentally bump into  urlLink the center for progressive christianity ....  while i saw at least one name floating around who thinks quite differently than i do (Marcaus Borg and I disagree (in a parasocial way -- since he doesn't know me) about reading the Bible as "truth")...  the  urlLink core teachings  they articulate *really* resonate with me -- much more fully even than the articulations of "emergent church" that i've encountered.  so in case you've been wondering whether andrew *really* believed anything at all (since he's more likely than not to raise one eyebrow at a good deal of evangelical christianity) -- the answer, today is -- i believe!
