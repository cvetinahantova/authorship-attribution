Well, I am officially exhausted. The adrenaline has run out - for now. I could have slept all day, but we had another full day of orientation/training.       Also, I forgot to mention that yesterday when Nate and I were out and about in Hong Kong, I made a trip to a public restroom that looked all fine and dandy. To my surprise, this bathroom had no toilet paper and people had to bring their own. Fortunately I had some napkins to use...I guess this isn't so rare in China, but I was not expecting it to happen in Hong Kong. That's traveling though, right? Prepare for anything!
