Today was a busy day.  Tim and I got together for lunch, and then I went out to buy supplies for this week's crafts.  I lucked out in that half the stuff I needed was on sale, and managed to save over $60.  Go me!    I also went to the library to take out some children's books for the story hours that start tomorrow.  Or at least, that was the plan.  However, the children's room was closed.  I asked the librarian, and was told that it had been closed for two weeks because the children's librarian was on vacation.  Why no one else could work down there to keep access to children's books available, I have no idea.  The good news is, she starts back tomorrow, and since the library opens at 8:30, and story hour isn't until 11:00, I can just run over there before I go to set up at the museum.    After running around for a while, Tim and I came back to my apartment.  The goal was to install my air conditioner, but things didn't go as planned.  My screens in my window can only be removed with an 6 foot ladder, which I do not have.  Even if I did have one, it would attract quite a bit of attention.  So I guess I'm stuck actually asking permission to have an air conditioner.  If they say yes (which is unlikely) I can just put in a work order to have the screen taken out.  If they say no (which is much more likely), then I'll be glad that I held on to the receipt, and didn't open the box yet.    In other news, I'm just watching the end of "Salem's Lot" and I'm very impressed by the job they've done on it.  It's been a few years since I read the book, but from what I remember, they are doing a very accurate portrayal of it.  Now I'm going to have to make sure that rereading it becomes part of my Stephen King kick.    Anyway, I've got to finish putting everything together for tomorrow's crafts.  That, and cross my fingers for some nice weather.
