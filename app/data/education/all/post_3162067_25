Well, my back is finally beginning to feel better. The osteopath did some crunching and some acupuncture and it hurt like hell immediately after (although, strangely, not at the time...) But over the weekend the pain has definitely been easing off, so that's good! My neck is stiff now though, so I won't spend much time on the computer. As it is, I have some exam papers to mark anyway.
