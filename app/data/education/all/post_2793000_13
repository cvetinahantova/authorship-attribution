Well, the reason I kinda cut off abruptly there was that, well, English was about to end, I didn't want to be late, y'know, the usual reasons. Anyway, Tomorrow, I have to wake up at the crack of dawn to go to the gayest thing ever: the ISSMA contest. It would be great to do this if I were still in middle school, were going with my old orchestra teacher, and it was optional. But nooooooooo.... I  have  to go - a mandatory, you - fail - if - you - don't affair - with the second best orchestra at the school (we're second best on a mere technicality - there are only two orchestras at the school I go to) and the wishiest, washiest conductor I have ever met. He couldn't control someone under a  dominate  spell, he's that bad.  At least it's all over at about 10:00 in the morning, which means I have enough time to take a bath, change out of my tuxedo they make us wear, grab my gaming books, and head off to Glendale mall for five hours of gaming heaven. Now, if only I can survive the first part of the day...  So, in closing, you're an idiot.  Sincerely, darkshadows86, Lord of the Underworld
