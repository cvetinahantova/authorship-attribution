First we lost the Challenger in 1986 and today we lost Columbia.  At approximately 8 am CST NASA in Houston Texas lost telemetry data with Columbia and soon after that they lost audio contact with the astronauts.  Debis from the space shuttle wound up scattered across the state of Texas and into Louisiana.  We lost another 7 people to the space program.  This is a sad day indeed.  Yesterday I lost my job at Ahold USA and once again I am seeking full time employment either as a contractor or a full time employee.   I have two recruiters that want to talk to me next week because I have been putting my resume on job search boards since November of 2002 when Ahold USA laid off 32 full time employees.    We are on the brink of war with Iraq as our military is gearing up for a major offensive half way across the world.  Stay tuned, more to follow...
