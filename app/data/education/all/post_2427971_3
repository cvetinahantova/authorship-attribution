Christmas day was pretty quiet, it was a nice quiet though. Got up around 7 and was dragged out of bed by my brother, he was more exited than I was about getting up at 7 in the morning... But hey! It's Christmas! So yeah, got pretty much everything I wanted... The only other thing I didn't get was a CD my mom couldn't find. It's all good, umm... Should I bore you!? I suppose so... Anyways, I got a Gamecube controller, Soul Caliber 2(fucking awesomest game ever!), Akira on DVD, some nice ballpoints, a Nalgene bottle, the softest down blanket known to mankind, Eternity(Kat knows;D), a new chair(that doesn't tip forward), A MONITOR(of which I don't have to hit) and AN ALF PATCH!!!! YEEESSSS!!!!... Alf eats cats, hehe. Afterwards I had breakfast and set up my monitor*drool*... So not a little P.O.S., I feel better now. Then for most of the day I sat in front of my computer, played games and drew in Photoshop(fun!). I'm usually on my computer, but not for that long of periods of time. Been a long time since I have... Well I had fun, beat COD on Normal and am working on Hardened(hehe)... YEAH!! SOOO!! Made a flaming tree in Photoshop, that was fun... I just can't get it to look how I want, just like all the others I've made :\. Must mess around some more! Eventually we went to my cousins house for a Christmas dinner, my mom forgot a present so I had to run back down to my house and get it(don't mind, exersize is good). So we ate and messed around a little... More like sat and watched a movie while the adults got drunk off of scotch, yeah... There's a little Christmas cheer for ya! After a while I started to fall asleep so I just walked home, didn't feel like waiting... And I wanted to talk to Kat. I was walking and wanted to get there faster so I jogged, that was refreshing... It's fun to jog in the cold ;). That should be it for today, probably forgot something, oh well... Have to do a chore... at 11:30 at night, ttyl!
