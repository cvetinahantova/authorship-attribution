Why do human have to undergo illnesses before they put an end to their lives? From the Christian point of view, Human Beings are originally born with a sin. Does this refer to the sufferings that we have to undergo through? or Is this the challenge that we have to overcom in life? Have you ever wondered why some people have to to struggle a while before they really rest in peace? I always believe that this is what God arrange, even at the very last moment - the way you die and even the few minutes of struggling you have to overcome.
