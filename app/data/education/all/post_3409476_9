Last night was my first night home without any baseball.  So of course we vegged out in front of the TV.     I just can't get enough reality shows.  I guess my life is so mundane I must live vicariously through others!  I watched the first episode of the new Trading Spouses last night.  If you get a chance to see arepet of this it is hilarious.  Two women from completely different backgrounds change places for a few days with a payoff of $50,000 at the end.  There are a few catches of course but the two that traded this time is like Florida from Good Times and someone from Dynasty.    Of course Big Brother is my all time favorite.  If you haven;t watched your tape yet, you should move away from this blog.  I can't believe eraser head took off Paris Hilton!  It is fun to watch with us at home as we rename everyone on the show.  Nakomis/Nebraska/Nickle  what the heck is her real name anyways?    Amazing Race is awesome once again , but why does it have to be on so late?!?!?!  Shmirna and Mirna provide plenty of comic relief throughout the show.
