Listening to: Send the pain below - Chevelle Mood: Happy, relaxed and calm    After a remarkable weekend away in the best of company, I find myself relaxed and serene.  However, money has an aptitude of being able to complicate (slightly) this mood of mine.  To say that this month is going to be short is an understatement; however, I am more than satisfied in saying that I actually have something to show for this shortage! For once, it has not been a month where it has gone to everyone else, this month I decided to treat myself: clothes, jewellery and a weekend away… Nevertheless, this was a once off as the following months I am not guaranteed work, even if I was, I really need to get my savings account back to what it once was and even better.  If I want the future to be filled with children of my own, then some sort of fund is going to have to be started because the last thing I want is to have the day-to-day stress of having a child to have the added grief of money troubles. But as somebody said to me only a few hours ago, there’s no point in thinking of what we don’t have, what’s now important is to try saving in the following months.  Regarding the weekend away, we went to Peniche and Foz do Arelho (see below), which are both fairly close by.  It was a restful and calm weekend, with laughter, conversation and love… and a really shitty football game in the middle (Portugal 1 – Greece 2)!!  It was one of those weekends that will be remembered, at least in my mind for the serenity it bought us… oh and the 2litres of sangria!!    Foz do Arelho    Baleal beach  HASTA
