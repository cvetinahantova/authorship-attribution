Hey  Well I just got home. I spent the day with my mom and my family.We ended up going to Redondo Beach to a fish market. It was sooo Good. You buy your seafood and they cook it for you right there on the spot. Man I haven't had seafood in a while and I really like it. After we finished eating we walked around the dock and the pier. I had a good time. I didn't end up going to care group afterall. I wanted to spend the day with my mom because  I don't do it often. I thank God for a nice time. My mom really enjoyed it.
