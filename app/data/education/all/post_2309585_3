Andy's uncle Doug Mullens lost his battle with cancer today. We were expecting this, but nowhere near this soon. He was a fun, awesome human being-- very educated and talented. He lived the best part of hippie culture and always strove to embrace and understand his fellow man. He loved music-- The Grateful Dead, The Beatles, and such. He was well read and enjoyed The Far Side and Calvin & Hobbes.  Doug had a family that loved him and he loved back. He was twice a grandfather, and had a best friend and soulmate in his wife Jeanean. We'll really miss him.
