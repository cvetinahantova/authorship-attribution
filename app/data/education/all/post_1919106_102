Fire. Meat. Good   For those who are wondering what that's all about: It's a hamburger chain's slogan. Mmm... Beef. Today was the first day in  Software Architecture . This one's a keeper. And in a world that seems to be running on one or another flavor of UNIX (half of the machines here run Solaris... *shudders*), this professor takes a stance for Linux. Good. Now we're going into familiar terrain.  I have to get a crossover cable. There's no way I'm going to pay $4.50 a month for them to plug my fucking ethernet port into the switch. So technically the old laptop (P150) running Debian is off the net, because it doesn't support cardbus peripherals, and the WiFi card is one of those. BUT - the other laptop (running Windows) does, so I'm going to route requests from its ethernet card to the WiFi connection, and voila. All I need then is the crossover cable, and I'll be free of csh hell! Long live bash! Long live ping! All hail fortunes!
