The title of this posting comes from the wisdom of a fortune cookie.   Okay, I did add the "in Bed" part to the end, but it did actually say "drink to your health" on it.  This fortune definitely ranks up in the top 10 I've ever received.  Yesterday, my folks came into town.  We ended up going to dinner at Kettle and Keg and having the best restaurant made eggplant parm from around the D+F area.   Then, we went to the Opera House and we watched Supersize Me.  It was a really good documentary and my parents both liked it as well as myself.  Afterwards, a feeling of sickness overcame me.  I realized eating out for the past few weeks probably hasn't been one of my healthiest choices.  My new resolution is to get back into cooking and eating healthier.  Today, the rents and I went on a Winery tour.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a fellow Vegetarian that I knew working there.  She gave us an excellent tour and it was good to catch up with her for a bit. I wonder if she noticed that my Mother was wearing one of her PETA T shirts?  My father and I sampled some Vidal Ice Wine and it was really good and really decently priced.  I really should have picked up a bottle of it : (   Other interesting and cool stuff that I would elaborate on, but I am tired and in need of sleep - We stopped at a farm stand and bought some great produce.  My Mother and I made some good Pizzas.  I found out at PT that I am able to take over twice the amount of electricty that an average person can take.  We went and saw Bourne Supremacy, which was fairly good besides some minor technical picky stuff.  D-bo forwarded me an e-mail indicating that some people are interested in buying Barker.
