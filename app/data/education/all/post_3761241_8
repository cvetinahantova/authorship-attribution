midnight... i'm sleep as hell, and i'm closing my eyes as i write (type) this, because i want to go to bed, and i'm probably going to drift off into sleep as i blog at the moment. funny thing is, this isn't really anythign special with a particular theme, but it's mroe blabbing. don't worry, it won't be as long as the last. a friend of mine was talking about flames and what-not, and i have to say, that lamely, i keep bouncing back form one person to the next. it's weird, because once i get over one person, i just get onto antoher. testosterone, or something. i seem to settle and i think i'm done now, maybe i've just given up hope. it's so pathetic, really, and you know, sometimes you can't help it. new flames, old flames. the great part was that every rejection was mercifully short, but without the bitter chill to it. it was just a small sting, a little bit of a down feeling, but something you could bounce back from.  i guess i'm done with that. i guess college's all about that. all about finding new people. you can't really do that in a small high school, especially since if it's a population of, what three hundred? and maybe about forty high-schoolers in total? but then again, people get lucky. a friend, Max, talked to me about "people dating for popularity" that "it must be the case that the two most popular kids in the grade go out." i have to question that. he just came from a huge school in miami to this small school, and you know, i think it was really vague. stereotypical. i mean, why? why does it have to be that way? are people so shallow? i put my largest doubts on it. i guess it's in a sense what one could call "conspiratorial."  why bother thinking about what other people say? it's none of our business, and we can't here it. if they really talk behind our backs, forget it! if that's what they want to do with their lives, well, their problem. growing up's part of high school.
