Yes, yes it is... and a very boring one at that.  My dad just came over... he brought over Freelancer, so I can play it now. I play the  urlLink IONCROSS Freelancer Mod . It's quite tough, because if you die, you die permanently. You have to start all over again. So that sucks. lol. Especially for me, when I'm just learning. I've never played this before... and starting out with Total War is tough. lol. Well, it's intense training for beginners. There will be no screwing around I guess. Oh, and I see that my dad's online now too. I'm going to play now. See if I can kick his ass. *crosses fingers*
