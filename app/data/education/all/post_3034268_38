Brief Statement on Saturday's Events  Saturday was a calm and productive day.  I spent most of the day reading and thinking about Zarathustra and overcoming, although there is no chance of me finishing the book right now as I planned.  Dave Hanson came over for a bit in the afternoon, although I left soon after to meet Amy and Julie at the coffee shop to study.  Tessa came over in the evening, where we had a few productive hours working on our presentations for Wednesday.  She left around 9.  I did some brainstorming for a couple hours, and then I went to bed.  Today, I still have mucho work to get done.  I'll post in the evening if there is anything worth blogging about.
