Alright, I'm going to start writing on this blog once again.  May through the beginning of June has always been a bit depressing, at least since I began school three years ago.  They were always exciting before that for some reason.  After the excitement of the semester, I enter into a period of minimum productivity until I hate myself that it serves as a catalyst to start doing something worthwhile again.  So, I'm not sure if anyone reads this anymore, and that's acceptable.  Over the last few weeks I've wanted nothing more than to stay away from people for almost the whole day--spending it in seclusion so that I can study or reflect, and then spend just a few moments with others for conversation purposes.  Since my last post, about 45 days ago, I've been to Seattle to take care of my grandmother, started an easy summer class, gained a girl friend, read two mediocre books, and finally regained my motivation.  Lately, I've been occupying my time by spending quality time with Jennie (my gf), studying Nietzsche (via Kaufmann's "Nietzsche:P,P&AC), Sartre, Intro to Psych (my summer class), and reading "The Idiot," by Dostoevski.  I am currently in Eagan in order to serve on Jury Duty (which was cancelled) and for Father's Day.  My friend "The Stingray" has returned from Iraq, and is starting a military intelligence school at Virginia Beach.  I'll be seeing him along with Joe (another Marine) in Pennsylvania during August.  If there are too many readers, I will destroy this blog and create another one, which will have an undisclosed address.  You have been warned.
