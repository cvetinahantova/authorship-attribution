It's my lolo's birthday!!!! Kaya lang, he's been dead since 1994. Miss him so much na....  Toxic at work but was able to squeeze in my task of calling my church to ask if there's a wedding before mine. Was able to print out also some stuff for my meeting on Tuesday with Mimoy and Apple, my newfound coordinators. Heheh.  Watched Apple's wedding last night. It was featured in Pipol in channel 2. Myk and I rushed home from 2 hours f playing badminton to catch it. Worth it. She was so happy :p  Myk's leaving for Batangas today... makikifiesta in Balayan, Batangas. i was supposed to go with them but since alangin, sila nalang ni Joey.   Time to go home now...I'm pooped...
