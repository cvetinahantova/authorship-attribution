I have had the most fantastic weekend, and I have been spoiled absolutely rotten! So I want to start off by saying a very big thank you to EVERYONE whop sent me birthday wishes and birthday presents. I am touched beyond words at the thoughtfulness of the gifts I have received and I must have cried for every pressie that I opened. And I still have Anna's and Phil's presents to look forward to! Thank you again. I, of course, will be thanking people individually (this isn't my lazy way of getting out of thank-you letters), but I want to say an especially big thankyou to my darling, sexy Si (akage no inmo hehehehe) for the wonderful day he gave me. He bought me such wonderful gifts. I have a brown and white panda toy (just like in my dream), a Shrek 2 sticker album (hours of fun), a brand, spanking new CD walkman (so so cool!), Jazz Legends CD and an art deco trinket box which is too beautiful for words. I am the luckiest girl in the world to have such wonderful, generous family, friends and boyfriend. I love you all. Si and I, yesterday, went to Lorenzos to have a meal (Coco Chicken...note to self, must get the recipe) and we went to see Shrek 2, which was hilarious. I can't recommend it highly enough. I spent all day on a very happy high, and that high is only just starting to fade now. Today, with my mum and dad's birthday money, I bought a top from Monsoon (in fuschia pink, all ruffles but is actually office-smart) and I upgraded my mobile phone to one that takes pictures. It's brilliant, but I don't have a clue how to work it yet. Now I must job hunt, then tidy up the flat. Then I might try to figure out how to work my phone.
