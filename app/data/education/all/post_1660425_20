My niece will be 4 years old this month. She too already knows how to work a VCR and DVD player. In fact, Papa (my father-in-law) was trying to help her get Sleeping Beauty started on the DVD player and he couldn't figure out how to get it started. My niece (independent that she is) said, "Here, Papa, let me do it." As a young adult and with plans for children someday, I wonder where technology will be when my children become school age. Will all computers be small, portable, and fast? My hope is that I can stay on the cutting edge as long as possible before I too become obsolete.
