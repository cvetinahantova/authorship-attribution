urlLink NEWS of the WEIRD  OK, I'll try to make this my final blog post about this site.  Today I used the News of the Weird  urlLink lesson plan  which is at LibraryInstruction.Com.  It went over well with my LIB 197 students although they were a little bemused by the approach but adjusted to it fine and really seemed to enjoy the class assignment.  One warning, this is not a good idea for students not in college.  Several of the groups decided to try to verify the strange sex stories that were at the site.  As most of the reported stories had nothing to do with sex, I was surprised that several groups zoomed in on these. (I guess I shouldn't have been...)  These groups of course volunteered to share what they found with the class.  The story about the couple arrested in the park for their S&M games was a big class hit.
