I have been thinking about the word love.  Specifically, longing for someone to LOVE me, not realizing that the ultimate One already loves me.  His name is Jesus Christ.  He has died for my sins and has accepted me back into His fatherly arms after I make my mistakes time and time again.  Now, if God can love a sinner like me,  urlLink why can't I love  those who have used and hurt me?  I don't know.  It's hard, but not impossible.  I can love if I don't keep focusing on how they treated me in the past.  I can forgive and pray for them today, so that tomorrow I won't still harbor the pains of yesterday.  God will fix them in due time as He is still fixing me.  I just need to stop being so cold and melt a little so that I can love those worthy and unworthy today.  Let go and God's love will not only change your life but He can change others lives with our prayers.  Be sure to keep love behind those smiles.  :)
