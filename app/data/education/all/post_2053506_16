Bubble Tea!  I finally had some! There's this Italian restaurant we go to and the last time we were there I noticed a place near it had the word "Tapioca" on a sign.  I ignored it.  This time we drove by, and I saw the place is called "The Bubble Cafe".  So, as soon as we were done with dinner, we went down to check it out.  There was an employee out front smoking.  They had a menu thingy on the front window.  I was reading it, and then asked him if they have Bubble Tea, he nodded and said yes.  Woo-hoo.  We went in and I was so pumped. I had coconut and pineapple.  Kinda like a pina colada actually.  I really loved it!  I will get more the next time we go there. Mark didn't try any -he's pretty picky.  They had fun flavors - I am excited to try some different ones.
