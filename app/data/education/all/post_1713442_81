urlLink SI.com - NCAA Football - BGSU hands No. 12 NIU its first loss - Saturday October 25, 2003 7:34PM  Ok, this has nothing to do with information literacy or library instruction.  (At least not directly anyway. I am sure I could make a lesson plan based on this game...)  But, as a graduate of BGSU, and a native of Wood County Ohio, I am thrilled by Bowling Green's football win over #12 Northern Illinois.  Go Falcons!  I hope BGSU wins the MAC and gets a bowl game.  From CNN, "BOWLING GREEN, Ohio (AP) -- Josh Harris threw for 438 yards and three touchdowns as No. 23 Bowling Green handed 12th-ranked Northern Illinois its first loss of the season, 34-18 on Saturday.  Harris was nearly unstoppable, breaking his career high for passing yards in what might have been the biggest Mid-American Conference ever. Only once before -- in 1973 -- had two MAC teams ranked in the Top 25 met in the regular season.  The Huskies (7-1, 3-1 MAC) were just one of four unbeaten teams in major college football coming into the week and were 10th in the first BCS standings."
