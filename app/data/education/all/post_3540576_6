My ma has always told me that writing things down was healthy for me.  I figured that, on the eve of the largest adventure in my life, I should probably do so, and see how things work out.  I'm writing this a day before my interview with NOVA.  I'm hoping that all goes well tomorrow, although I'm fairly sure that I'll get the job.  I've also laid out most of my plans for my first few months in Japan, but, as they say, even the best laid plans can be laid to waste.  Hopefully this old addage won't ring true in my case.  I don't have much to say today, but I'll keep on writing here, with the intention of looking back on these entries in the years to come.  Ronnie
