This weekend has flown by. I was working in Luton on Saturday, in scorching temperatures, it turned out to be a long slog, but it kept me busy and active. Sunday was spent down the gym and doing housework - lawns, washing, cleaning floors, washing up, ironing, dropping films off etc etc. Before I knew where I was it was 20:00 Hrs. The highlight of the day was a half hour phone conversation with Angela. It got a bit heavy, but I didn't mind - such are our feelings for each other. How can one person make you feel so different about yourself?
