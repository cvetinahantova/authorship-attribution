I don't know why... but iI'm really tired right now. Daddy is not home.. he's in KL, for doing things that don't even want to know. Next week, 11th is my birthday. Two days after, is goona be my brother's first concert. I wish i could go and watch his powerful perfomance. But, I don't know, am I going to celebrate my birthday with my family? Don't know yet... I don't know if my parent can spend time  for me.I think i'll celebrate it with my friends.
