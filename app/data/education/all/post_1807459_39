Ok this is my first drunken blog but I'm going to try and keep things under control.  I'd like to say that the Hotel Ariana rocks my face off.  This place makes their own beer and has a pretty darn good live band.  I say this b/c they sung "winds of change tonight".  They did well but I could have done better.  I somehow ended up there and drank a lot of beer.  So now I find myself in a pc room b/c I don't want to go home drunk.  The hotel was really awesome, there were a ton of people there for a Wednesday night. Ok my tagboard is a little out of control.  I'm at a different pc room and I can read it now.  I'm going to ask that people keep stuff to at least and R rating.  I think I made the mistake of giving this page to some friends back home who have started to abuse the tagboard.   Today was long and boring.  I had a rough day by LIKE standards.  Which really means I didn't do much I just didn't enjoy myself.   I'm looking forward to my B-day is about a week.  That should be some crazy fun.   I was hoping to call Asma tonight and see what the deal was with Seoul but I guess I'll call her tomorrow.  Gabe did you ever get in touch with her?  Becky is in China now I guess doing the Great Wall thing.  I'm a little jealous even thought I've already been.   Ok fuck it I'm going to play some games.
