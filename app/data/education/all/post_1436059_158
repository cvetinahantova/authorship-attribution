"...I've been all over the world, I've seen a million different places. Right through the crowds and all the faces, I'm still out there looking for you..."   Where has my spring weekend run off to? It's Saturday, and I only get Monday off now so it seems to be passing me by without me doing anything particularly special. Grandma sent a card with five dollars in it for Easter, and said she misses me and loves the long letters I send her every few weeks. Well, I love her and I think she must be terribly lonely up north without Grandpa now, with only the freezing cold wind and Sugar Loaf mountain to keep her company. Still, Lord knows I needed those five dollars since I spent the last of my own money for the last payment for the Canada trip. HA! I'm poor.  Mom's painting the hallways again. Man, my house is like a madhouse! We have builders adding to the kitchen and upper level, my mom is painting the hall, Shelby is cleaning out the shed, and it just seems a lot more like spring building than spring cleaning.   Thursday night I talked online with Ryan and Keniesha until I couldn't keep my eyes open. On Friday I didn't really do much. I used two pieces of wood and hammered them together to make a cross (or the letter 't' whichever you prefer). Then I painted it blue and shoved it into the garden dirt just in time for noontime of Good Friday to roll around.   Today I haven't done anything.   I can't wait for Easter. I don't know why...I guess it's just like it's officially spring or something. And I'm sick of the rain already, since it always seems to rain whenever we have a meet (grr....) but I love spring and fall, so I can't wait...  Besides, Easter and Christmas are the only Holidays I wear skirts for (Besides the sports banquets) and dress up for.
