I finally have a chance to breathe.  School is out for the summer, so now is the time to refresh myself and prepare for the fall.  Something came to mind today. . . When things start getting overwhelming at the beginning of the semester, I ask my students one question, "How do you eat an elephant?"  The whole class will look at me with this blank stare, then one students will answer, "A piece at a time!"    Have you ever rushed through life, trying to do it all and worry about how it will all come together? Don't worry about it, God has it under control.  If you put it in God's hands, he will work it out for you.  The tough part is having the patience to let God do his work.  I don't know about you, but I have always found myself wanting everything to be fixed right now.  I can't seem to wait.  I want to know what is going to happen tomorrow.  But guess what, that is contributing to my stress and preventing me from enjoying today.  Tomorrow will come, but  urlLink let tomorrow take care of itself , there is a possibility that today is the last I may get.  So being patient and finding something to smile about today should be enough!  Wait on the Lord he will renew your strength in due time.  :)
