yeah so lets try this again.. i froze it the last time..  today has been boring. Sheila came over and hung out for awhile that was the highlight of the day so far. we went to sonic for lunch but that was to bribe my brothers to keep quiet. the thing they are black mailing me with.. i'll post later lol. after she left i watched jurasic park which is sad because i've seen it like 20x and for some reason it never really gets old.. it wasn't the best movie ever made and it's not even close to being my fav but i don't mind watching it when there's nothing to do. i played poker most of the day. which was fun cuz i suck lol. but that's ok... anywho.. i'll be back later to babble some more.
