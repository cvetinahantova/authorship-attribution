Beneath the eyes of heaven, dusty shadows push the sun westward,     Into the dark night beyond, without sound, save Cattle moving endlessly through fields of black grass, gently crushed. Black forms eagerly approach that sleep of death,     With thick poison climbing like clover honey.   Peach pits break teeth in the midst of sweet nectar while     Children laugh. Children laugh, and small children watch as death greets them     From a bloodwashed sky; And old men wash away former death with frothy glasses of future death.   Like a thundering herd, the multitude rushes with dust and darkness     Toward the sea, the burning sea; So anxious to escape fire they immerse themselves in hell.
