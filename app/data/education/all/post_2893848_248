Three weeks off of knee surgery,  urlLink Bill Mueller maybe ready to hit , but he isn't ready to construct metaphors:   "They took out a nice piece of crab meat out of there and some spinach dip and painted a nice picture in there," Mueller quipped of the arthroscopic procedure which took place three weeks ago. "Everything's good. Real good."   What the fuck, Bill?  That's gross, unnecessary, and it doesn't really make sense.  Sometimes, I think that baseball players are dadaist poets working in a strange vernacular, and sometimes I just think they're stupid.  I don't know what that says more about: me, baseball players, or dadaist poetry.  And it's not just the players, either.  Gammo's columns remind me of reading a note in illegible handwriting; any sense I make of it is contextual as much as it is present in the writing itself.
