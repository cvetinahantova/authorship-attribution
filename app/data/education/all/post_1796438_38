Ta-da!  I'm back from the non-posting place where I was (I call it school!). No Morgan, exams are not good. I havn't even started studying yet. Oh well, I guess I can do it the night before.  In English Lit we are ringing King Oedipus. It's a really messed up story. The run down: king and queen have a baby who is destined to kill his father and marry his mother. The king and queen are so afraid they send the baby away. He grows up, gets in a fight with his father (who he doesn't know) and kills him, the returns to the city of his birth (which he doesn't know). They're lacking a king and he answers a riddle, so he becomes king and marries his own mum. Disturbing.  My Restaurant Rules is sooo cool right now. Ash and Amanda rock! They won against Sydney. They beat Brisbane. Now it's them vs everyone else. I've been talking to Ash via the internet (my friend, the net). I've asked him to send down some flyers so I can hand them out around town. I'll get Candice to come with me (she's already agreed) and I'll work my way up from there. I also mentioned that I really like Room Nineteen's hats (hint, hint). I hope Ash reads his messages tonight so he can send them tomorrow, delivered overnight, here Thursday, delivered Thursday and Friday afternoon.  (I like new makeover on www.blogger.com. Very nifty)
