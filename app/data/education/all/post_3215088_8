Today went ice skating....almost more than 12 yrs since i last ice skated. Was apprehensive at first but accustomed to the ice quite fast. As i got more confident, i tried to go faster....and Faster.....and FASTER......the expectable happened. I did a fly dive after tripping over the front of the skates....as if playing subarashi at the former fantasy island. I flew and slided across half the rink with my bellly on the floor. haha...but neber say die.....tried more and more....faster and faster. In the end ....ended up with injuries on my 3 limbs....oni my right hand is free of injury. My legs were bruised while i got some a slight sprain or muscle overstretch on my left wrist which i broke 6 yrs ago. Can feel the pain. Though painful but worth the fun. I was not the oni one with injuries . In fact i had the least injuries even though i have the most beautiful dive. The rest of the gang are in a worse situation than me.  Went KFC at kallang after skating and we gobbled down chickens and had free flow of drinks. As usual the gang was never statisfied with an afternoon of activities, so am i. But as usual, we cannot keep to one topic for more than 30 seconds with all the idiotic stunts like using a bottle of shampoo as a handphone. Finally decided that we will head down to pasir ris beach for another round of drinking ( my consecutive 2nd day of drinking at pasir ris beach). Finally finished the half bottle of voldka. We had a few rds of games admist drinking and forfeits were included. I had to do a POLE DANCE on one occasion. Though i dance like a nerd, but WHO CARES??? Just join the fun.  It is now almost 5am and i wana KOONZ liao....Oyasuminasai Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
