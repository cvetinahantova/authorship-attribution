I am so tired. It's all hot out, and for some reason my bag was really heavy today, and I walked to the student parking lot before I went to the front of the school, so I've exhausted myself. I hate hot weather...  Anyway, I'm going to work on that periodic table some more, and I'm going to see if I can't get out of the house later... then I can at least have the AC in the car.
