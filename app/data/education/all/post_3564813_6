Well, this is my first update to my new blog! I'm at the library with a friend at the moment, I was going to get out some books but I don't have a library card so I can't they put me on the computers anyway.  Today was the first day back at school after the holiday it was ok, but we had Miss Beckett and she doesn't teach us anything so that was really booring, luckily she didn't talk much we just got on with doing our James Bond review.  Someone else was supposed to come to the library but he couldn't make it for some reason or another. Anyho, I'm going in to town after this, might get a game or something, I dunno.  Jack has his pool out and has his friend, so I definilty want to avoid going back there for a while, or else I may get caught up in something so boring, I dunno.  Anyway, German today was ok, we learnt new stuff with a good teacher unike ms Lonsdale, who can't teach to save her life! She would be better of as a fish merchant. Honestly, all she ever does is shake her head... constantly. UP and DOWN! ALL THE TIME!  Anyway, Darren's getting bored since he can't go on a computer so I'm gonna go out to town soon. I will write more later when I get home, ok?
