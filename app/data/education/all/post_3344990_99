I received word from a friend this morning in e-mail stating that she would like to be able to leave comments about my drivel.  Wow.  Way cool Patty.  So, I will be attempting to install "Blogspeak" which is a free service that allows others to comment on my writing within our web log.  In order to "see" the changes I have to edit my template for our weblog and then republish the WebLog for the changes to appear.  That gives me ample opportunity to both drivel about new events as well as test.  Way cool aye?    James Moffitt http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt moffittj@bellsouth.net
