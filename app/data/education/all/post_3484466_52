Well, I went to the band thing at the Monroe Boys  and Girls Club, and it was massively awesome.  urlLink Rhymes End  was there, as well  as  urlLink Smiling  Politely , and this band I'd never heard before which was called  something like One Carper Green...  Anyway, it was awesome, and I'm going to go get the  Rhymes End cd, because they roxors my soxors...  Current Music: Gary Jules - Mad  World
