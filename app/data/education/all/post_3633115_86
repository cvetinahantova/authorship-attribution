Well, at least ours does.  S broke his foot a week ago today, he still has been unable to get in to see an orthopedist in order to have it properly checked out and to determine a course of action.  Why is this?  The insurance company will not accept the referral order written by the ER doctor and only wants one from our PCP.  We went to the PCP on THURSDAY and he still hasn't gotten a referral to see the fucking orthopedist.  Such a load of bullshit.  My husband has a fucking BROKEN FOOT and can't get in to see the doctor to get it fixed because of a bunch of bullshit loopholes that the fucking insurance company has him jumping through.  Assholes.
