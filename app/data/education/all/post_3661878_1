So yeah, already three days overdue for another post.  Well, this weekend started off pretty well, I saw "The Terminal" with Sean, and I thought it was a great film.  Very creative.  THen it all went downhill from there... I had a WHOLE WEEK OFF next week between school years and a certain friend of mine is being a stinky and not wanting to go away for even one night.  Let's just say when depression hits ya, it can hit hard.  THen saturday night we almost didn't got out...I was just in a bad mood.   So I have decided to "X" out this weekend and go on...today was a crazy day at school.  Softball game was supposed to happen but we weren't allowed to watch for some lame reason...the kids are acting like, "let me outta here!"  And I'm ready for a mini-break between years.  I have stayed the latest I have stayed this year at school, (6:00) and I got a hell of a lot done.  I am beginning to get sad that my first class is leaving me.  I mean I have learned so much this year, it's unbelievable.  I had a wise teacher tell me that she cried everyday her first year of teaching.  I only cried less than a week, I would think.  So I guess I'm pretty lucky.  There's a teacher at school who had my class last year, and although he told me that they were horrible, he acts as if they are the best class ever, and seems to try to taker over my class and make it his own.  HE-LLOOO!!!  You are DONE with them!  Let go, man.  anyways, hopefully he is leaving next year because he was just always sooooo negative towards the kids and threatening constantly, and never following through with the threat.  Which is one major thing I learned this year:  If you say something to those kids like you mean it, follow through with what you have said, otherwise they won't believe you and will stomp all over you.  Whew!  Nuff said for today...
