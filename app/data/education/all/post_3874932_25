This is from a Baumgartner and Stennkamp  International Journal of Research in Marketing  (1996), "Exploratory Consumer Buying Behavior: Conceptualization and Measurement."  I'm not sure their scale/findings are of great interest to us, but some of what they say about innovativeness and curiosity in their review and development may be of interest.  From a paper on exploratory  acquisition of products (EAP) and exploratory info seeking (EIS).  "Consumers who are high in EAP enjoy taking chances in buying unfamiliar products, are willing to try out new and innovative products, value variety in making product choices, and change their purchase behavior in an effort to attain stimulating consumption experiences" (124-125). Can this be said of our adopting seniors?  In any case, here's a tidbit on curiosity: "It is generally acknowledged that curiosity is a powerful motive underlying cognitive forms of exploratory behavior (Berlyne 1978; Fowler 1965; Voss and Keller 1983).  Berlyne (1963) proposed that need for cognition was a determinant of cognitive stimulation seeking and Olson et al. (1984) have shown that Petty and Cacioppo's Need for Cognition scale correlates significantly with a variety of measures of curiosity, including Trait Curiosity" (p. 129).  "...our framework suggests that...risk taking, innovativeness, and variety seeking in product purchase and curiosity-motivated search for information share a common characteristic in that they offer the potential for stimulating experiences and are motivated, at least in part, by a desire to adjust actual stimulation to the most preferred level." I do think our curious seniors were seeking stimulation.
