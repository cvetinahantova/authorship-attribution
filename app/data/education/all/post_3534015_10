My sister is married and gone to mexico for her honeymoon. My other sister leaves to return to Washington this afternoon. We are going out for lunch later, and I am very much looking forward to it.  The wedding was beautiful. I really liked the vows. They were beautiful. The ceremony went off without a hitch, which was the most important thing. The reception was good. The food was great! I enjoyed it alot. We had all sorts of left over fruit and cookies.   :D   I'm totally not complaining on that one. The watermelon was nice. Sarah and Naomi did a really really great Spice-Girls lip-sync. It was so awesome! I've got some fantastic pictures. :D  Speaking of pictures, Herman made the observation, we will not be getting the same photographer. The photographer himself is fantastic. He does superb work!! However, "Mrs. Photographer" is horrible. She was rude and bossy and just downright ignorant. She wouldn't let him take any of his own pictures.  Like.... for real!! He ended up sadly disapointed with only 71 shots.  I got around 80ish.   Most of mine were casual shots. They were really nice. :)  Anyway, all in all, it was fantastic.  The evening just blew my mind. The reception ended around 7 or so. We cleaned up and went back to the house. Took about 30 minutes to tidy through the house, so that wasn't bad at all. We were all wiped. My feet were a tad swollen and quite sore from wearing heels all day.Herman sat me down on the couch and washed and massaged my feet. It was without a doubt the sweetest, most loving thing anyone has ever, ever done for me. I am so loved! So blessed!!I couldn't believe it. He absolutely embodies love in his actions towards me. I just hope I can show him to the same degree how much I care for him.
