So I go to write a new post, and Blogger has added a whole lotta new stuff!  How Fun!     I wonder what I can  screw up  play with.     Ohhh....new fonts!!   I really like trebuchet and Tahoma, but Tahoma isn't offered. *sigh*   So much I can do now.  I think I'll jack with it all later.  I have to attend a         "Mandatory Meeting"
