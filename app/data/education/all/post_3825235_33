So, we went to the park on Sunday.  Just AbbieDabbie and me.  It was cool, and nice to be able to be just the two of us.  During the semester, she usually doesn't see much of me, so I am going to spend a WHOLE lot of time with her during the next 3 weeks.  So, back on track...She was very excited because it has been a while since she was able to go to a park, especially with her Moma.  I love it that she gets so excited when I am able to be with her, but hurt at the same time because that just makes me think she wouldn't be like that if I were able to be with her more often, but you do what you gotta do, right?  So here she is being my Dare Devil!  urlLink     Doesn't she look great?  I  love  that picture.  We're off to get my sister, that wonderful sister o'mine!  (think:  Wizard of Oz.)  So, we went to the airport to pick up my sister earlier tonight.  SO EXCITING!  It's a whirlwind trip, but at least we get to see each other and spend some time together.  It's amazing how much my niece grew in just the month since we last saw her.  Que Chulo!  Well, I need to get in bed so I can get up to go to work in the morning.  Hopefully, I will be able to post pictures of the girlies soon.
