Off to Prague tomorrow morning and will be gone for a little over a week. I've never traveled alone so I'm not sure what to expect. Hopefully the trip will give me some time to sort out some life questions that have been eating at me...   Well, if you're reading this, pray that I'll have a fruitful and clarifying trip...and that I won't get mugged or beaten... thanks.
