I'm really curious about this whole blogging thing and interested to see if anyone reads this.  How much can I reveal in this anonymous kind of forum?  Can I post my deepest, darkest secrets and have assurance that no one will be able to track this back to me?  Can I rant incessantly about people that drive me nuts?  Can I use this as a way to do that daily journaling and writing I'm always avoiding?    Well, here it is.  Welcome to my blog.  I had no idea what to name it ~ my best friend originated the half lazy/half crazy phrase.  We both agree that all psychotherapy would just boil us down to that diagnosis.  Half crazy, half lazy!  Yep, that about covers it.  I don't have to work tomorrow so maybe I'll come back and just ramble on.  Until then... good night!
