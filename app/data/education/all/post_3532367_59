Today I've got a cycle ride planned with the kids (I'm off work this week on leave). Nothing too special but its a case of finding things to do with them, that are cheap but can involve everyone. I've also set things going with the bike. Handover has been arranged for Saturday afternoon, I've been offered a lift back by a good friend and I've spoken to the finance company with regards to paying off the amount outstanding. I've got to put this on a credit card until the mortgage money comes through and put the cash into a savings account to buy a cheap run around car, after mine has been handed back. I still have my car at the moment, but this is in the process of going back to the finance company under their voluntary termination agreement - this is where I have paid more than half of the finance and I can hand the car back without penalty. Unfortunately, I wasnt able to do this with the bike as it was on a loan instead of HP! Something to note for the future.
