GOLF AND THE GRAVEYARD    urlLink This  quote is great.   "Antelope Valley can be surreal, alien and bleak, making it the ideal location for horror and science-fiction stories," said Harry Medved, author of the upcoming St. Martin's Press travel guide, "American Backlot."  I don't know what to say.  It's true.  I was assalted by potted plants today.  i was behind a semi as was driving to work.  The backdoor of the trailer was open and potted plants were spilling out.  I had to swerve to miss hitting some.  We came to a stop light and a guy jumped out of this truck, picked up some plants, and threw them in the back of his pickup.  Good times.   I wrote a story on Friday, but it isn't on the website.  Here it is though...  Highland is team to beat in GL golf  By DARREN HARBAUGH Valley Press Staff Writer  CALIFORNIA CITY�To no one�s surprise, Highland won another Golden League match on Thursday at par-72 Tierra Del Sol.  Highland shot a 390, 28 shots better than second place Quartz Hill. Erik Jarvey led the field with a 77. Teammates Eugene Park, Pat Londono, and Ryan Kahl and Quartz Hill�s Nate Anchete tied for second with a 78. Highland has won all of the Golden League matches this year. Thursday was the fifth league match of the season. There are three remaining.   �Highland is running away with it, � Lancaster coach Steve Radford said. Quartz Hill coach Dale Carson is pleased with his team�s play this season, but the way Highland has been playing the best they can hope for is a distant second. �I tell the guys to have a good time.  Don�t worry about chasing anybody,� Carson said. But second place is not bad considering the top two teams in the league qualify for the postseason. For now, the rest of the Golden League is looking up at Highland.  �We hope in the next year to two years to really start competing,� Radford said.  The Golden League coaches would probably agree. Most teams are going through growing pains because their best golfers are underclassmen.  Nate Ancheta and Brian Barcelona of Quartz Hill and Sergio Hinojosa of Lancaster, all underclassmen who finished in the top five Thursday, offer their teams hope for the future. As teams look to the future, Highland dominates the present. They routinely place four players in the top five at Golden League matches. Thursday, the wind was a major factor. �This has been pretty rough,� said Radford, who�s team hosted Thursday�s Golden League match.  �The wind is usually 15-20 miles per hour, sometimes a little worse.� A little worse is right.  The National Weather Service routinely lists gusts of 20-30 m.p.h. in the Valley. �In these conditions, you have to play your ball differently, but it�s part of the game.  You just have to know how to handle it,� said Carson.   The wind has been a challenge for Golden League golfers all year. Sometimes, the wind is so strong that it doesn�t simply affect a golfer�s play, it wrecks havoc with it.  In fact, a match was cancelled at Tierra del Sol a few weeks ago because of the wind. �The wind was so bad that day, you�d swear the trees were bending over,� said Jerry Riedmiller, who works in the pro shop at Tierra del Sol. �The wind must have been 50 miles an hour.� But no matter what the conditions, Highland storms on, while the the rest look to next year.

Side note on all this...Friday was a very interesting day for me.  First off,  urlLink California City , where the tournament was held, was freaking no man's land.  It's over an hour north of Lancaster.  i drove from LA to get there, so I was driving for about 2 and a half hours.  Mojave is the last town before you get to California City and as I was leaving it, I saw signs for Las Vegas and Yosemite.  I was in Egypt, man.  But after seeing these signs, I looked out across the desert and saw and bunch of airplanes.  i had to blink, because I thought I was seeing things, but no, there were literally hundred of airplanes int he middle of the desert.  Not little planes, mind you.  They were 747's, jumbo jets kind of planes.  I'm serious.  I couldn't believe it myself.  I stop my car and got out to count.  I couldn't see them well, they were in the distance a bitand a building obstructed a bit of my view, but I counted 104 from what i saw, and then as I drove on I saw even more.  Mojave's a town a about three thousand.  The whole thing didn't make sense.  I was pretty tripped out.  I thought I was either in an alternate universe, or in the midst of a giant government conspirary.  I though I might be able to nab a pulitzer from it, or at least a congressional metal of honor.  but sadly, my  urlLink mystery  has been solved though. And finally, the  urlLink deathblow  for my bizzaro day was when I stumbled upon the facts.  You've got to check out those pictures.  They're pretty crazy.    I got to the golf course and they let me use a cart to zip around and find the coaches.  All I could think about was the movie, "jackass."  It was a great experience.  I almost drove into a sandtrap.  There also had this bridge across the freeway.  It was dope.  I should have jumped it.  The Highland golf team is undefeated, but I couldn't find the coach.  Rumor is he was sleeping in a van in the parking lot.  I was driving back and a blew through a stop sign.  I looked the mirror and there was a cop a ways behind me.  I took a quick right and went around the block and ducked into a gas station.  I still have Michigan plate after being in California 5 years, so I really didn't feel like dealing with that pig.  I picked up some tropical skittles and an RC Cola and headed back.  I didn't see the cop again.
