- fell asleep at nine last night.  think i'm overtired.  sorry i didn't call you, Gary (if you're reading) & Brendon (pretty sure you're not)  - rumour is that Brendon (et. al.) up and moved to Austin TX -- where I've been wanting to visit for quite some time -- still -- sad to have him go so far...   - had a family movie night last night because, i think, both parents were so exhausted that that was the only feasible toddler survival strategy.   - got some relieving news at work -- a major stressor has been removed! (not tenure & promotion -- still slaving away on that...)   - the tile we want for the bathroom is on backorder for two weeks -- so the project will be on hold once the walls are sanded and painted.  so far it looks airy & light.  so opposite from the 70s ski lodge that its been for so many years.     - speaking of TandM construction (who we love) --  urlLink Toby  is blogging now! Welcome, Tob!    - we leave for myrtle beach on friday for a week with the in-laws. Jan asked some incredibly probing insightful questions about family relations while she visited.     - Addison is cutting molars and so has this psychotic edge which suddenly appears in the middle of his otherwise: cute, happy, laid back personality.   - our basement is almost dry from last weeks floods.  had to throw out the old mint green carpet that we had salvaged from the last owners of our house.  what a loss!   - Trena successfully shot her whole film over the weekend! Kudos to crew!   -  urlLink Jared' s grandfather passed away -- (see his blog for details)   - life feels pretty much like a list right now.  ah the marriage of form and content...  ~peace.
