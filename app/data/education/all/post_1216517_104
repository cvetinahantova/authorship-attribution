We used to have a grocery store in the middle of town. It burnt down when I was six. My mother and I were inside, an alarm went off and we had to evacuate. I remember standing outside, underneath a blinking red light, watching flames shoot into the sky.  All that was left was tiles. Broken, charred tiles for years and years. I rode my bike back and forth over them and pretended I was riding though aisles of produce.  They built a new store, a bigger store, outside of town. I would ride to it on the old railroad track that was now just a white stone path. Then up a hill and through a cornfield to pick up dinner or ice cream.  The tiles are gone. They have been replaced by a dentist office and a bank. And green grass and trees But they are not very appealing to me.
