If you haven't guessed from my post titles, I love Aerosmith.  I went to see them in concert in October.  I love their music.  I love the energy on stage.  It's amazing.  Currently I am reading their biography, "Walk This Way".  It is very good.  I highly recomend it. I've missed catching my favorite guy friend on-line for the last couple of days.  I know about when he usually gets on, but that has been coresponding with times my mom wants to use her computer lately.  Ah, well.  I'm trying to figure out when I can get her to let me borrow her car so I can go to Cruses and see Luna and her little ones.  I miss them.  They are the funniest bunch of kiddos.  Ari loves the world.  Donovan is a real sweetie.  Have you noticed that the older you get the more you start calling your friends "honey" and "sweetie"?  Why is that?  Is it just that we've gotten over all our hang-ups and realize that it's okay to tell people how you feel?  When we were younger, we never told each other "I love you."  It was like we were afraid we would take it the wrong way.  Now we say it all the time with the perfect understanding that it means "I love you."  Now it's okay to admit we love our friends.  I think that's important.  To tell each other we love each other.
