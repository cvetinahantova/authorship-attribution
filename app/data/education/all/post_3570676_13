Here are some web resources for my project about autobiographical poetry:   urlLink Poetry Express   poetryexpress.org  This site will form the nucleus of the students' writing phase of the project.  They will work through the "15 poems you can write now" activity as part of their experimentation with autobiographical poetry.     urlLink The Favorite Poem Project  favoritepoem.org  The purpose of visiting this site is to highlight the connection between real life and real poetry.  This project is one in which famous people (and regular people, for that matter) share their favorite poems and tell why they like them.  Students will explore this site and develop some ideas about why some poems are dear to peoples' hearts.     urlLink The Newshour Daily Poem     This daily poetry feature from the Newshour highlights autobiographical poetry.   urlLink
