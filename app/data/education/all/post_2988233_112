ALl the kids my boys know that are homeschoolers are going back to public school next year.    I have asked my boys if they want to go back,a nd they keep telling me no.  Even if it means no sports.  TJ said it wasn't worth it to him to go back.  They would put him back int he 9th grade which he did this year.  He wants to graduate early.  Casey said he doesn't like the teachers, the kids, none of it.    Will doesnt' care either way.  I don't know why my kids don't like school.  Or the school setting I should say.  They would rather be home.  They actually enjoy being with their parents and brothers.  Even if they do get on each other's nerve and drive me nuts, they want to be at home.   That is just fine with me.
