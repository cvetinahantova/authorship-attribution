where i somehow convinced the bishop to set aside $1200 of the ward budget for senior couple missionaries every month. when he agreed, i guess i got up in sacrament meeting or something, but it was more like the marriott center than a chapel, and bore my testimony of missionary work and how important it was. i made sure everyone realized that $1200 meant that there were like three and a half people in the ward that could leave on a mission right then, with no funds, everything was already taken care of. the bishop was nodding and stuff. also, people were laughing at various points through the testimony, which isn't normal, but i guess i was making jokes or something, because i kept raising my hands as if to quiet the laughter and saying things like, "i know it's strange, but isn't that how it always is?" and, "i know, i know, live the gospel and be happy...who would've thought?"  i have a vague notion that mike was there, but i'm not really sure now.
