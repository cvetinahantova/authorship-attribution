At least I managed to get some sleep last night. I woke at around 01:00 and 04;00 again, but it was better than the night before. I feel al little more relaxed although I've not heard anything from the dealer about cancelling the car order (despite chasing him up yesterday). I've started the second hand search again and found a Proton Compact, Vauxhall Corsa, Toyota Celica and a Rover 200 - what a mix!  I should have a fairly busy day today, what with work and a school meeting to attend this afternoon - and I've got to make an appointment for the doctor for next Friday too. I've been feeling hungry today again - eaten most of my lunch already.
