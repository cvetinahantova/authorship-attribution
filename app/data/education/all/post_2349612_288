well, maybe not the world, but the country... i've been on the phone for the past 2 hours..  half an hour chatting with colleen about housing; we're doing lunch tomorrow and then visiting more places =P  half an hour on the phone talking with eric about our trip next month and about math stuff; we agreed that tomorrow we'll chat again and make ourselves a studying for quals schedule to keep each other on track; we studied for math GREs together for a semester in budapest - hopefully studying together again even long distance over the rest of the summer will be good for us too =P  20 minutes playing phone tag w/ dad for a plant question  then 40 minutes on the phone with ian renner... he was online this afternoon for the first time since march/april, when he told me his dad had died earlier in the spring; i got more details actually talking to him... he's done with his masters degree in statistics and living in michigan indefinitely long to help his mom and grandma cope with things now that his dad is gone; as luck would have it, he'll be in detroit for a concert the same day as eric and me will be there visiting on our trip, so hopefully i'll get to see the boy for the first time in well over a year!  and now here it is 6:30 -- what a day... time to read, make dinner, and be a vegetable =P  later dudes =P
