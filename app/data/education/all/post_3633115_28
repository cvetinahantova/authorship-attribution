Why is it that it is the middle of summer and not a bathing suit to be found?  I need to find a one piece, or a tankini, before tomorrow when we head to  urlLink Schlitterbahn .  I made the hideous mistake of purchasing a two piece earlier in the year, and now, I realize the error of my ways.  The result is a woman who will be wearing a bikini when she REALLY shouldn't.  *sigh*  Yep, that'll be me.  The one everyone says quietly (and others not so quietly) "what was she thinking?".
