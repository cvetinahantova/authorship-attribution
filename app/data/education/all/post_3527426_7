The Lost Along the Way of Omelas   Looking in their eyes: Incredulity. “Yes,” they say, “It’s better.” Perplexity. Astonishment. How could I not see the obvious?  The suffering of one:  Innocence.  That suffering gives contentment to all. Happiness. Enjoyment. Surely it’s worth a child’s pain!  Still looking at them: Unbelief. Where, then, is compassion? Empathy? Love? Is it worth the pain to save another?  Later, sitting alone: Contemplation. Can one know happiness without pain? Delight? Sorrow? If there is not one, can you value the other?  There must be both: Realization One cannot learn true pleasure Without true mourning.   This poem was inspired by a discussion I had with some students while substituting at an area high school. They were a great group, and we had some good discussions. At one point, they suggested I read the short story they had recently studied, called “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” by Ursula K. LeGruin (It was, I discovered later, the mild version of the story.) I did read it, and our discussion afterward led me to write several poems, firstly in despair at their calloused responses, and then in rebellion against that callousness. This poem is a sort of mediation between the two feelings.
