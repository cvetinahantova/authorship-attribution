I thought that only people wore masks.  I am surprised to see that organizations do too.  I was pleased with the change in tone from the Democratic Party, but I ask this; where was this a few weeks ago?  The Kerry campaign is without substance.  He puts forward no comprehensive view, no solutions to the problems he outlines.  Now we know that the election is really a referendum on The President, but still, what can you possibly support?  He tells us that he "would have" or the U.S. "should have."  How?  Can you say that you would have built a coalition with the corrupt French government?  The Germans would have send their thirty footsoldiers to fallujah?  So we'll see what plan he outlines.  Not one vote has been earned yet - it is simply disapproval of the current situation.  The question is, who will listen?  The ideologes on either side?  Independents aren't even paying attention, it is all gut reaction.  George, the ball is in your court.  A mask will only obfuscate your shot.
