I dont know how this is going to turn out... im in the dark again... i hope nothing to bad... um, i was suprised to see someone taunt another with something they hated so much... it wasnt right, especially after this person had been heling the other with their problems... it doesnt seems right at all, i regret not saying anything about it to them when they did it. I wish id reminded them of what they were doing, theres no use now though... the damage is done and theres nothing else that can help that. it just sorta suprised me to see them do this after all they'd been helping the other with... as was i, i didnt do what i shouldve... im sorry... i shouldve acted sooner... other than all that, there is of course more to speak of... i went to kats with zak and sarah to watch the extended version of The Two Towers... her mom only let us watch the first disk :\ wouldve been better if we had stayed up til 11 :D we had fun... ate a good dinner, i spun in a bunch of circles and got really really dizzy... i had fun, The Two Towers is awesome... i THINK we'll finish it Friday or something, dunno. thatd be nice... a few words were popped into my head while i was there, it was part of a joke but ive been thinking of them and they make perfect sense to me... it sounds sorta surreal but if me and kat are lucky enough then it can work, there will be no falling into place... thats saying it lightly, but if she really loves me the way she says than i could end up spending the rest of my life with her... im not getting to any conclusions whatsoever, but if we're lucky enough i would be the happiest guy alive. im not sure if i should be posting this, but its whats in my head... this all depends on where we both go after high school, i really hope nothing happens to us... I love her more than anything.
