July 4th is coming.  Patriotism comes to mind, but who are the patriots that you see?  For many patriots are limited to those who choose violent professions like the military.  But what about non-violent patriots?  Who are your non-violent heroes?  I have one that comes to mind:  Myles Horton of Highlander Center in East TN.  He began his life as a labor and community activist, creating the Highlander center as a place where activists from all over the country could come together and teach each other about creating social change.  The Highlander center changed over the years, shifting to civil rights in the late forties (as the left activists were kicked out of organized labor) through the sixties. Then taking on issues of environmental justice,  community reinvestment as well as anti racist mobilization.  What remains is a commitment to cooperative egalitarian knowledge transfer with the goal of social change.    What are your non-violent patriots?
