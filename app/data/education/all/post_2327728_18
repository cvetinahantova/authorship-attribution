Hmmmm... I have been neglecting you, my dear blog.  Sorry baby, but I have been busy, and these days, so rarely motivated.  That point can actually get things started.  I was reading The Coast last week, and there was an article about SAD - Seasonal Affect Disorder.  I think I have a mild case, since the only thing that I have been motivated to do this week is get out of bed in order to plant my ass on the couch.  Good times.    But, I have a new friend (yeah for me!) and she is super-fun.  I feel like a winkie in a home who needs to count the number of friends I have.  Pathetic.  But whatebs, Katherine (and friends!) is great.  A bit young, but still awesome.  That is more pointed at her friends anyway.  They are all still so much cooler than I am, but since I am older and in graduate school (oooOOOooo) I get extra points.  I have developed an infatuation with Muchmusic's new VJ, Devon.  Holy crap so beautiful.  I love him to death.  He will be mine... I have a three part plan.  Muhahahahaha!  www.muchmusic.com/vjsearch.  Look, but don't touch.  Finally, anyone want to make out?  I had a discussion with my friend Nick about my new attitude this year.  My attitude is that I know I am a great person, and I know that at some point I am going to meet somebody perfect, but right now, I just want to have fun.  Nick suggested I was looking for Mr. Right Now, as oppose to Mr. Right - which is a fair and accurate statement, but I was still insult.  Fuck him.  I'm out.  In a while, alligator.
