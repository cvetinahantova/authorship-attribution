Hey! Today's a new day and I'm supposed to be doing my work...LOL...Not a whole lot new... But This morning I herd from my best friend that my ex-boyfriend was harassing my best friend's boyfriend. It's a long story but basically by boyfriend screwed everyone over (including me) and now he's trying to make everyone's life a living hell... So this morning, after my friend told me this, I went up to My ex and "Talked" with him. I know now he is going to file harassment forms against me and everything but I just wanted him to realize that I don't want him touching my friends or my boyfriend.  Anyways; I started off with a bad morning, like usual, but I guess it's all good. This morning I lost my glasses :(. I can't see a thing but I'm not totally blind but I'm pretty close...  Anyways I'm going to go. I have another website to post on...Bye!
