I spent from 11 PM to 1 AM last night watching the Olympic Track and Field Trials. Bob Kennedy wimped out of the 10,000 (6-Mile). I watched the women's 5000semi as well, and that wasn't so bad. Between the 5k and the 10k, though, was all 100m and 200m crap. I slept through that. So then when I finally went to bed (after Kennedy left the race, consequently) I was tired as anything and slept until 11AM this morning when Kendra called me and woke me up from my nightmare about Canada.   I finished the AP Modern European History packet for next year today. I'm also going to the 5k race today at Annapolis High. The girl that always used to win the two-mile during Outdoor ran the 5k last week, and she won it with a really slow time of 26:07.7. That is slow. Reaaaal slow. Maybe it is just because it is summer.   I saw King Arthur with my dad and Corynne. It was pretty good...it was okay...the only reason I didn't really like it was because my two favorite characters died in the end, when they could have had two other guys that no one really liked die. Tristan died, the cool dude with the eagle, and Lancelot (Ioan, from Horatio!) died. Grrr.  Not much else going on. I got a capo. YAY! It cost me 17 dollars, though...
