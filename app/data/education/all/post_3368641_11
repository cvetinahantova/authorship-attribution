what I have been led to believe that you are a mirror of me I no longer accept in totality you are not reflecting me when you are cruel when you are loveless when you are without grace  I am not searching my psyche any longer for clues to my inner child's shortcomings I am seeing your darkness for what it really is: it is yours I walk away from your emotional routines  and find sanctuary in hearts like mine I will disown your world and finish with this spiritual charade  I shudder to think that I have judged myself so harshly for so many years for so much bullshit go be king of your mountain no one cares but yourself  the mighty will roar from their shit heaps across chasms of self-importance while I shall remain free from the tyranny  of defecation elevation  if you don't give a shit don't fertilize with it  Â©2003 DC Vision
