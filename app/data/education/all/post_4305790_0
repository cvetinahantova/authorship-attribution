Many inspiring environmental innovations are featured at Rolex Award. One of the 2000- winners was  Mohammed Bah Abba , a Nigerian who created an earthenware fridge named Pot-in-Pot system. The technique used is evaporative cooling. That may not be a new idea, as many Slashdotter commented  here , but upon further reading of Abba's invention, it can be seen that he applies those ideas effectively and is successful in helping his community. The invention also has potential to be applied globally where climates are warm and money is scarce. So he deserves the award after all.  There are more inventions that I like, such as  David Irvine-Halliday's LED light  and  Hans Hendrikse rollable water container . I've seen plenty of darkness and women carrying heavy luggage on their head on my car journey from Medan to Jakarta, some thousand miles in distance. I wonder if the rollable container can be used for carrying other stuff, such as liquid rubber. It may prove to be infinitely more useful if it can be modified to carry a variety of materials. Shall investigate this.
