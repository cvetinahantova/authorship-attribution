So today my friend (the one that's a mutual friend of Marine) kept asking me if I'm going to her wedding, I finally told her yes, I would at least go to the ceremony.  Then she was asking if I was going to bring Cop (we all went to high school together), I told her no, that his wife would never allow it.  So she told me to find a date, because I was welcome to bring someone.  Then Blah starts IMing me asking when he's going to get to see me again.  I just ignored him, the thought of spending time with him makes me want to drink cyanide!  I can't stop thinking about Army.  I have to write him a letter tonight.  I care, and worry about him so much!  My old roommate is going to be in town this weekend and wanted to know if I want to go out, I kind of do... we always used to go to strip clubs, it would be fun to go again.  Well, I'm bored, I think I'm going to flirt with the new guy in the office.  hasta manana.
