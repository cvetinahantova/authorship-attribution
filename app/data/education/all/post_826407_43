In fact the whole weekend has been excellent. Spent the afternoon  in the Park with Expressionistas playing Ultimate Frisbee in the park (which suddenly became quite a contact sport due- not entirely- to a future brother in law).  Just before we left off roader pulled up and unpacked a large hot air balloon.  The spectacle of this balloon inflating and then taking off turned a lot of us into little children again.  It was a beautifully site.  Afterwards we went back to Tim's and, inspired by the idea of self propelled flight, began constructing our own hot air balloons from greaseproof paper, candles and string.  We spent the good part of the evening making the "balloons and eventually even the cynics joined in.  It was fun, childlike and creative.  Sadly nothing actually took off, eventually the paper caught fire and our dreams of flight went up in smoke.  So we lit a bonfire instead.  Once again the evening felt like family.
