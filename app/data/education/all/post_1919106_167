FUCK!   Fuck fuckeddy fuck fuck fuck. Dam fucker.  FUCK .   Ah, much better. Wait, that's a lie. I hate fucking MS Word. I hate it with all my soul. When you set a text to 2 column, and use the "selected text" option, then  DON'T FUCKING CHANGE THE WHOLE FUCKING TEXT! . And to make things worse, don't  START THE TEXT IN ONE FUCKING COLUMN, THEN SWITCH TO THE OTHER, THEN SWITCH BACK TO THE FIRST! . Goddamn fucking fucker, whoever designed that should be shot in the foot, then fucked in the ear, have his/her lungs filled with angry wasps, blood replaced with caustic acid, and skin peeled away with a cheese grater. And that's only the beginning.
