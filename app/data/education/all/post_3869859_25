Texas. Where condoms are displayed prominently in drug stores (next to the check-out counter) and airports.  Texas. Where the per capita number of pickup trucks is higher than every other state.  Texas. Where an astronaut floats over McDonald's.  Texas. Where you can show your handgun license to get past the NASA security guards instead of a driver's license.  Texas. Where it's so hot that you feel like you're walking into a sweaty blanket when you walk outside.  Texas. Where you can buy fried okra in the cafeteria at work.  Texas. Where they eat vegetarians for dinner.  Texas. Where astronauts play and learn how to fly.  Texas. It's growing on me.
