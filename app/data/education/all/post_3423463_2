i guess things are bugging me today.  yesterday the home teachers came over. they seemed rather cool, if not exactly dressed for the occasion. plus, we forgot they were coming...which reminds me where i'm supposed to be right now. that sucks. ..  .  ok, now i'm not going to write.  man. too bummed to write. what a crapper.
