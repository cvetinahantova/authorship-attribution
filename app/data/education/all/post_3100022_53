Ok So Finaly I have found a real job, and in London too. Someone has been hounding me to update my blog because everyone has been wanting to know what I am doing right now. I have very little time at the moment, because I have dropped in the deep end and have to get more work done than I have hours. Obviously updating my blog is not one of the most pressing engagments I can think of right now - this is going to be a quicky and dirty post... So here goes:  I am working for a young company called Utopia, they have several business objectives: "Make money", "show people a good time" and "combat the forces of evil around the world by helping the general public become more aware of the inequities and tyrany of global corporations such as large oil companies, huge ever expanding fastfood chains (who harness the power of billions of McChildren�; to do thier dirty work for them) and crooked governments"  I am the knight in shining armour for this companies money making vehical, I am the mechanic that will finish off a three year Behemoth of a project that has been dragging along in a perpetual state of unfinishedness for quite some time. They need expertese in quite a few different areas of IT and I am able to provide most of it. I am their swiss army geek.  So what do I get for all of this? lets see what's behind door number three!  For four days work I get the following: �250.00p/wk in my rocket (tax free), free accomodation all expenses paid, no bills, nice comfy double bed and fully furnished/decorated room in a upmarket apartment on old street (know for its exceptionally good knightlife =)), sky tv, a computer in my room that I can work on, broadband internet, the list goes on...  At the moment the project is so intense that I am actually working way more hours than I am supposed to but we have a agreement that I will get paid for as many extra hours that I do. Suits me.  So I hope this is enough to whet your apetite.  Take care, I will write soon about the area I live in.
