This is a test.  Of what I'm not sure.  I logged in and now here sit, facing what some people dread - a blank page.  The fear might be like what someone once said to me about children; its frightening, because think of how much you can mess up.  I suppose all of this white space could be seen as a chance to make a mistake; but greater still the opportunity for success!  There have been many words written, printed, etched and carved, and each one was someone's attempt to communicate SOMETHING.  How to cope with death, how to discipline your children, how to get the toothpaste out.  Anger, stupidity, love, lust, lies and every other thing imaginable.  I could look at all this white like some literary blizzard in which I'll get swallowed up never to return.  But spring has arrived.  I don't think the white space will last long.
