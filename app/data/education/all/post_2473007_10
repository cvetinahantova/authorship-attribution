My soul cries out with the deepest plea for heaven To bring me a kindred spirit knit so tightly to my very soul     That I cannot move or breathe without the spirit of that          One moving or breathing beside me. I have tasted a summer closeness that died with The first bite of autumn frost; the ripe communion, so     Soft and sweet and satisfying to the soul as cold water to parched lips,         Lay brown and consumed by death. Just to see the seasons, sun and rain, move us as one Mind, body and soul ever closer to closeness; Ever     Amazed at the mere whisper of the truest words         Spoken with and without voice. To become life clearer and brighter and completely base; Existing only within the thoughts and events of each other,     Vaguely aware of the disappearing peripheral, and yet         Intensely alive with singular vision. A soulmate - not merely a disciple or a lover or even a deep-seated friend, But a yearning for the other that placed not even self before them,     Passionately connected eternally with something deeper         Than smiles and words and perfume. I lay down in the grass and weep     To love one with every moment given to love, and     To be loved by a soulmate.
