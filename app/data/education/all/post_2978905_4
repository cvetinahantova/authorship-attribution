Now is likely not an appropriate time to be writing... however, I feel that it is somewhat necessary.  I don't know why it's necessary.. I was going to rant on about my excessive boredom.  But at the moment I am absolutely irritated by a certain person. This is likely one of those blogs you write now.. and delete later.  People might figure out that you're a lunatic, if they ..even for a moment, can understand the true capacity of your brain.  By yours.. I mean mine.  So... I went to get my hair done today, always a pleasure.  This time I had to match it to some fabric for the wedding party I am a part of this weekend.  I have convinced myself, though it wasn't hard, that Saturday is going to be the longest day in all of eternity.  Hair style and make-up at 9... wedding, pictures, supper,reception,dance, bed.  Yay Bed!  Summer Holidays -->  Last blog I mentioned about how I wasn't looking forward to working.  Apparently the summer job doesn't actually need my help.  This makes me very sad, because although I can openly admit to dreading it, it's been four days of me being completely bored out of my mind.  A summer job would have been nice.  Crazy person... I'm just going to let that slide.  Apparently that is all I have to say.  My cousin is coming for a visit this weekend, starting tomorrow actually, and there is never a dull moment when we are together, so I can admit that I am SO Looking forward to her coming.  I might have to ask for time off from my boredom. Yikes.  Until Next Time.
