Pity school was kinda boring with Chemistry class. Lol we were so daring, we were listening to our MP3 and radios and discman and stuff like that during his lesson which of course he didn't notice at all. So yeah we escaped it good, though it shan't be repeated again. So I spent my day on MSN chatting...staring at the plain screen... played with little DeeJay and got biten on the thumb.Lol. Around 6 pm my butt got sore with all the sitting so I decided to head to Jake's( my bro/ closest friend) place to study. I was so glad I managed to finish at least 3/4 of my homework. I headed back home cycling in the lovely drizzle, had dinner and again went out, however this time round it was to TM with Jake. It was kinda lame, we were like going in and out, back and forth all the time but bought nothing. So our final destination... Swensens! Bought this really delicious gorgeous looking cookie summit andÂ ate to my fill. Yeap, thats been yet another day for me... hope something rather more interesting with occur tomorrow. Anyway I'm heading off to watch wrestling, peace out ya'll and pleasant dreams.
