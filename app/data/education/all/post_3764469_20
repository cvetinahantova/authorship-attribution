all right, stop. collaborate and listen.   and we're off! it's that time of the week again, friends and lovers, when we go visit the dark annals of the web searching for worthwhile stuff. mostly there's trash, yes, but we search anyway, hoping to find that one magical site which makes our day worthwhile.  side note: i went to my cousin's debut last saturday. it had a 70's disco theme, so we had a chance to let loose the raging John Travolta inside.   AND because i still have a hangover from that badass mix, this week's WTF List will let you - yes, YOU - do dat crazy phat mix in the privacy of your own home, cubicle, Starbucks, airport urinal, wherever you may be!  so, check out da mike while da deejay revolves it!     urlLink i know where bruce lee lives  - a kung-fu remixer? yo time has come!   urlLink supergreg  - you might be 'numba one', but for chrissakes shave off that monobrow. you look like edward medel.   urlLink hestekor  - in case you haven't seen the singing ponies, here they are. shoo-wah-wah-wah!   urlLink ken's virtual drumkit  - finally, an online drums tutorial!   urlLink virtual playground  - a showcase of really old drum machines. by the way, they ARE playable.   urlLink flashkit drum machine  - very low-tech. VERY nice.   urlLink create-a-band online  - so, SO awesome. reminds me of the high school days, where anybody can start a band.    stop. hammertime.
