I suppose I should try and create a bit of suspense concerning the outcome of Wednesday's interview, if only to make this a little more entertaining for you, The Reader, whoever you may be.  Can't be arsed I'm afraid.  As this somewhat downbeat introduction has probably already told you, no, I didn't get the job.  Camden Jobtrain sent me a letter which I got this morning when I got back to Yarmouth.  I have mixed feelings about it all.  On the one hand, I'm glad I got the interview, It was the first application I've made since getting back to the UK, I know I gave it my best shot etc, etc.  On the other hand, an angry voice in my head insists, 'Isn't it my turn to have a stroke of luck?'    I'm taking it better than I would have done in the past though and the experience makes me wonder just exactly what it is that I want to do jobwise.  I don't want to work in a language school.  There we are, I said it.  I just don't: most of them are cowboy outfits and (gasp! - another confession on its way...) I think I'm bored with TEFL.  It's all pretty straightforward which is why I liked it so much in the beginning because I found it easy and I knew I could do it.  I want something more than that out of a job though and I want to avoid getting stuck in something I couldn't really give two shits about at all costs.  However, I'm still very apprehensive about going into teaching 'proper': i.e PGCE, etc, etc.  I want to throw a tantrum and shout, 'It's so easy for everyone else - all my other friends have proper careers and do interesting, demanding jobs and I worked hard for my degree and ITS NOT FAIR!'  I just let the toddler within go off and do its thing while the sensible grown-up part works out exactly what I'm going to do next.  I know I want to live in London.  I know I want to do a job I enjoy, that doesn't exhaust me and that has a point.  This is as far as I've got - and I'm not a particularly patient person by nature so let's hope I come up with something soon.  I'm not really interested in standing up in front of a bunch of stroppy teenagers and trying to teach them the finer points of direct speech or A Midsummer Night's Dream.  (Note to self - No-one's asking you to).  I wonder if I would find Primary more up my street - the older ones, say 9 - 11?  I loved teaching that age group when I worked for Bell two years ago.  Thinking aloud, thinking aloud, boring myself and you too probably (U2 - now I bet they aren't short of a bob or two, just like Simon and Garfunkel, eh Rose?) so I'll draw the line __________________________________________________________________  here.  Then again, perhaps I'll just carry on with my real-time cogitations...  It comes down to a couple of things.  I don't want to wear myself out (the M.E nastiness) and I don't want a job that overwhelms me so much that I can't pursue the 'writing in the evenings' dream. Perhaps I ought to think of a job that was somehow more directly linked to writing but God only knows what.  Perhaps I should address all this stream-of-consciousness rambling at a qualified Careers Adviser rather than at my poor long-suffering friends.  I'm so jealous of people who seem to be 'sorted' even though I know that it can be a bit of an illusion.  I hate moaning, although reliable sources say that I've toned it down a lot these days - the NMC is long behind me thank the lord.  Okay, this time, I am leaving.  Here's that daft line joke again ________________________________
