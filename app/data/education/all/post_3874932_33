I keep forgetting about technology discomfort, a variable that Parasuraman measures in his technology readiness index and which we used on the survey.   Technology optimism and technology discomfort are two different variables.   What we coded in our qualitative data (I believe) is  fear .  I'm guessing that technology discomfort and fear are pretty close to the same thing.  The "fear/technology discomfort" theme should probably go in the section I drafted on technology optimism and self-efficacy/proactive coping.
