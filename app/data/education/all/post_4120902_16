I'm just a kid who wake up at 6 AM daily and spending just 7 hours at home. Nothing special, just loves to walk around aimlessly because I love to travel around and make new friends. pretty busy with school activities makes me spend less time with my family. My dad, my mom, my sista ( who lives in Selangor ) always doing things on their own. Well, i'm not going to blame on them because they have worksssszzzz to do, and i can do my things on my own. Wake up at 6, go to school, back home at 2.15, go to school again at 3, back home at 7, go toschool again at 9 and back home at 11 is quite fun for me. My job now is study coz i wanna make my parents proud of me. Hey, the trial exam will be in a month time. 7 A's, yearrgghhh!!!
