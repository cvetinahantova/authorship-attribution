You're Element is Water. You are soft and serene at most times but like Wind, you're scary when you're mad. You proabaly have a talent is singing and even your speaking voice is lovely. You have an innocent type of beauty that makes you look younger than you are and you like close relationships with people.     urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)? (PICTURES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Smeesh, did I ever fall apart this weekend. Apparantly I've gone from being mildly anemic to being all-out pretty freaking anemic. By Friday morning, I couldn't get out of bed. I just laid there and cried, because I was too tired to even move. So, Andy held me for a little while while I whimpered, and I was asleep again by the time he pulled out of the driveway to go to work. I slept solid for about 6 hours. Luna was ecstatic that someone was home with her, so she kept bringing me toys and snuggling next to me. I felt much better by the next day.  Mom's put me on a vitamin regamin and loaded me up with veggies, so I'm feeling better. Still a little weak and sleepy, but mentally, I'm wide awake.  Random note to self: I need to dye my hair again. Maybe red this time-- I haven't been a redhead in a little while.  We took Luna out to Andy's parents' yesterday, and decided to walk her across the field to the pond. Then, about halfway across the field, we took her leash off and just let her run. Chase, Tina's dog that she left with her parents, went with us, and the two of them bounced around in the grass chasing each other. It was so cute!  She's still worn out today. I don't think she's ever run that much in her whole life.  Oh, and Bennett and Alex, if you're reading this-- bring over a puppy! I wanna see one! Yay for puppies! :)
