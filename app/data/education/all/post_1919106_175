Just thought I'd post a bit of an update on recent happenings with friends...   urlLink Richard  moved to VA. Layla is currently following on his heels. So good luck Mr. Richmeister on your new job, and a safe trip to Layla.   Brooke is getting married to Aaron. No date set, but they're planning for next spring.   John Piccarazzi is also getting married. In fall.  Shabnam got her Master's, and has moved to the ECE department for her Ph.D.  Well, that's it for concrete news. And since I don't like spreading rumors, I'll stop there.
