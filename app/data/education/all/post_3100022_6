It is really hard to get good quality internet time, I mean there are internet cafes everywhere arround europe, but it is just not the same as sitting down in front of your own keyboard and typying away to your hearts content. I would really like to go through and proof everythign that I write, but unfortunatly I can not as it will cost mye extra. so please excuse the bad spelling, and punctuation.  So yes, I am still alive, but I dont often get the oportuninity to updated this blog. =(
