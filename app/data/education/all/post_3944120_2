It was rather choppy, not the best motion picture quality.  Too bad, too, for those Panasonic screens are pretty sweet!  I think the crappy video quality has something to do with the teleconference stiff that we have to blow the signal through on its way to the monitor...it's not just a straight RGB from notebook to monitor.  Phooey, there goes my idea of a HUUUGE PC monitor on the weekends for EQ, hahaha!
