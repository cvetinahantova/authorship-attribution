i've decided to keep a log of the different odors i encounter on the way to and from work every day. they're interesting, if disgusting. keep in mind that these aren't faint odors i have to look for, they're right-up-in-your-nose stenches that permeate the air for miles. impossible to miss.     july 13: skunk. and skunk poo.  july 14: the accumulated biological waste of ten thousand people  july 15: all of china is here, it's july, and they haven't showered in weeks.  july 16: decaying vegetable matter  july 17: rotting, unevacuated intestines july 21: rotting cabbage and chicken manure
