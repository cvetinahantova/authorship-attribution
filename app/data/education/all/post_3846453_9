Actually, I am not stumpy at all. I am (almost) average height for a 15, going on 16 year old. Well, 1.60m ish. Not THAT stumpy. My sister's stumpy. She's small, and probably under-average. You see, she's got a medical problem called Vertically Challenged. She goes to a support group every Monday (Oh, s***, that's her drama group, you've spoilt the whole effect now Jimzy!), ha. Anyway, what she lacks in height, she makes up for in brains. (Oi- S) Anyway, this is about meeeeeeeeeeeee, not my 13 year old sister.  I'm called Jimzy, well, thats not my REAL name, but do you think I'm  that  stupid to put my real name on the internet. Don't answer that. I'm 15,and in year 10. I live in London, England, which happens to be the c******* country/city to be living in at the moment, seeing as we possibly will be bombed with nuclear weapons very soon by countries we wrongfully invaded because of our  STUPID  prime-minister Tony Blair (Bliar).  I finished my Year 10 exams, so ROLL ON GCSEs!!!  I have to put stars in place of swearwords, because at school, there is a system that picks up swearing and disconnects you from the internet.
