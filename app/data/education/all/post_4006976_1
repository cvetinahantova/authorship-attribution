We have a friend who is a city inspector and he was out working in the neighbourhood and called me on his cell when he was at my mom's lot. He brought us back some perfect tomatoes from her garden....  We were joking that all that was left was fried green tomatoes and baked potatoes....  Today was the first day of the workshop.  Overall things went well and we had a good turnout despite the situation.   It's hard to get back to normal and do every day kinds of things right now - my mind is just not there....
