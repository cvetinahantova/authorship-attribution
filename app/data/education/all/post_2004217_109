I spent most of the day with Sean today. Sam and his brother Joe (who is ace, incidentally) were there for a couple of hours but as Sam fucked up his back (mysteriously, no one knows  how  he did it), he had to leave at about half past 2 and so Sean and I just hung out for another couple of hours, wandering, chatting, browsing CDs. It was really, really nice; I felt so comfortable with him, like I was able to just be  me.  We talked about everything from my parents to his parents, from The Streets to Slipknot, and it all clicked: while we don't like the same bands, we agree (mainly) on the bands we don't like, and we seem to be on the same sort of level morally/politically, as well as having a similar sense of humour. And he lets me link arms with him! Most guys just let their arm sort of drop to their sides, leaving me sort of *clinging*, but Sean let me get comfy and fall into step. It made me feel valued, and thus warm and fuzzy. Huzzah.  How odd it is that I'm now comfortable with writing about my feelings for other people in my blog... until recently I've just talked about me for fear of offending or scaring people, or giving them the wrong idea. But hey, this is me, this is what goes on in my head, and I have enough language capacity to explain anything, should questions be raised. Oh my god: have I finally grown up?  Ceff x   I don't care if you don't love me, and I don't care if you don't change, I would live inside the shadows that I cast for you, if it meant that you would stay
