Okay so I got the key to my new classroom yesterday.  Today I was able to move my boxes and such from my parent's garage to the new classroom.  Dave was kind enough to help with his truck.  It took a quick two trips and now everything is there.    The problem is though, that I have to set it up!  I'm soooo excited about it.  I am doing the GT training through Carroll ISD (since I am still being paid by them and because mom does the training) in the mornings so I can only work in the afternoon/evening time at the school.  By the way, the GT training is interesting because mom tends to single me out sometimes and tell stories that I have heard about 100 times in my life.  It is still a great training, don't get me wrong and I'm definately not bored and learning A LOT!  Back to the classroom topic - I'm nervous because this time last year my classroom was all nicely set up and this year I'm scrambling to even find my room in this new school.  I've decided that my "theme" will be bears!  I had sort of a patriotic theme last year and this year it's more of a bear/apple theme.  So, if you find anything bear/apple-ish, let me know!  (o:  I suppose that is all the news for now.  More classroom news to come!  (oh and I will try to post great class stories - with no names of course - but there always seems to be something good to laugh about in elementary school)
