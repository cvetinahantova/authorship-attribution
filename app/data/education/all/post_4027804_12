::yawns:: I don't plan on going to school today. I just feel like skipping, because well, it's not like I'm getting too far at the time, anyways. ::yawns again::  Revelations came through with full force yesterday. I happened to come to terms very well with myself, as well as acknowledge a few other important things that'll affect my life in a big way. Still, I struggle a bit with thoughts..ugh. Man, really; I need to think less.  I never got to go for the job opportunity. I have to call again, and since I'm taking a day off, I'll just make plans for today. ::yawns:: Man, where are friends around, when you want to talk...::shrugs:: Too bad I can't just walk down the street and pull a friend out through their window, and just chill, heh. I'm gonna go to bed in a few. Ciao.
