Corporations and think tanks hire lobbyists to influence legislation. These same companies contribute heavily to politicians' election campaigns. Lobbyist system supporters state politicians only act in the interest of campaign contributors because of shared ideologies and common interest. But the lobbyist system is also marred by corruption.       Do you believe it is ethnical for an elected official to support funding or legislation that benefits his campaign contributors? Would it be more ethnical to bar corporation contributions to election campaign?
