i have practice today. deep down in me i know that twice a week of training is inadequate. i need to train at home, but the low ceiling is a hindrance. i cannot even do men at home. i've asked the seniors for help, they advised me to cut a shinai so that it is adequate to clear my ceiling. i only have one shinai...i guess i need to get another. my target is my next pay day but i have a lot to save for and i hope i can squeeze my budget for an additional 40 dollars for a new shinai.
