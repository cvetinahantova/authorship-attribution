Anyone know of a great math simulation site?  If you do urlLink  email  the address to me Please.   I think I may need one. I'm about two mini semesters off from my statistics course, and I had a real shock Tuesday. About 7 years ago, I had studied and studied to pass an honors statistics class at DBCC, and did pass - with an A no less.  But Tuesday, a student who knew that I also tutor up to College Algebra came by and asked a few questions about statistics [from the third chapter of the same book and edition that I studied] that completely baffled me.    What makes it worse is that some how, I'm fairly certain that MBA statistics courses are going to be harder than AA statistics courses.   HELP!
