Met a boy. Met a Jack. A special Jack.  Do you know why it's called Kije's Dream? Because it's the dream of someone who isnt real. If real people dream of unreal things in their subconscious, don't unreal people dream the real?  I have a picture of what my life looks like. It's this huge set of scales....thousands of scales balancing each other out. Always in constant motion, to and fro, to and fro. But sometimes, the motion stops and everything is balanced. That perfect moment of poise and beauty is what I aspire to. Except aspiring is the worst thing to do. And so the scales tip.  Met a Jack.
