And nothing got done   I didn't do homework. I didn't clean up. I didn't do the laundry. I didn't finish my characters. I  did  call in to get the door fixed.  So, on Saturday I woke up to the tune of the badger song - you know,  urlLink this one . Apparently Morgan snuck into my room (which is easy, since I sleep like a boozed up rock, and my door is broken) and had it playing for the better part of an hour before I woke up. He was leaving for the UC to play XBox with the folks he works with. In the meantime I went with carol, Amber, and Tracy to "The Dreamworker" and got presents for Jeff. Then we got back (and another of my immobilizing scratch spots was found out), and we spent some time at Carol and Amber's. I got ticked until my stomach hurt. Then I went back, Morgan showed up shortly, we watched Army of Darkness on SciFi, then Greg and Matt and Aubrey showed up and we started the AD&D game. I almost got chewed to death, turned an orc pink, killed another enemy with the secret ninja move staff critical, set a whole lot of stuff on fire (including myself and the other party members)... And got the most experience out of it. Oh, and I found out that when I lick stuff now I can find out whether they are magical or not. By then it was 4am so we broke off there and I went almost straight to bed.  Sunday: five minutes after I wake up (I was with a pillow on my head, trying to go back to sleep) Amber IMs me, so I end up having to get up. She came over for some yerba mate tea, we talked random talk for about an hour, and Amber decided that she wanted to wake up Carol now. So she does. Everyone agrees that we should rent a movie, so we do, and get snacks... We watched Dreamcatcher and Dogma. And I got tickled a lot again... My sides still hurt. But it was fun. I got to lick both Tracy and Carol in retribution. This is going to be another of those precious moments in my "memory warehouse". Hmm... Time runs again.
