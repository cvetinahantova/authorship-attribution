Another Great run this week everyone!             Thanks for being there, and thanks to everyone who made it in the face of life's challenges.  It is a priviledge for us mentors to be of service and contribution to you.  Wendy, Debra and I are working hard behind the scenes every week to make your Sunday runs go as smoothly as possible.    We want this to be fun experience and an opportunity to share and contribute to each other.    As such I want to invite more of you to post to the Blog on your experiences and insights along the way.     Also to comment on what people post!  When you share, you contribute to us all!     Remember: It's is not all about the running! it's really about life!         It's about:          Being in action.    Being your word.    Sharing yourself.    Being good to yourself.    Being able to forgive yourself and others.    Being of contribution to others.    Being able to stumble and get back on track...    Remembering that the journey is as important as the destination!       Peace, MaryKay
