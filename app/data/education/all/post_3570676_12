I found several very good Keyboarding/Word Processing Web Sites.  This site is  urlLink Keyboarding Online at Crews Middle School .  The site has a section called “Rules & Tools” which contains questions and answers about keyboarding skills and technique, home row keys, tips for better posture, and keyboarding tips and rules.  It also contains information for parents and interactive activities for students.  This site is great!  urlLink http://www.crews.org/curriculum/ex/compsci/keyboarding/    This site is  urlLink Catawba County Schools .  I have listed 2 URLs.  The first link is the CCS home page.  The second link has  urlLink Computer Skills Remediation Materials  that are wonderful resources for the North Carolina Test of Computer Skills given to all 8th grade students.  The site contains sample questions and worksheets to help students prepare for the State test.  It contains an Online Computer Skills Jeopardy Game with questions that cover the basics of the Multiple Choice Computer Skills Test.  There are also Online Spreadsheet, Database and Word Processing Power Point Presentations.  I appreciate the School Systems who make resources available for others to share.  Thank You, Catawba County.  urlLink http://www.catawba.k12.nc.us    urlLink http://www.catawba.k12.nc.us/pages/sites/edwebsites/computerskills/index.htm     This Site is  urlLink St. Stephens High School  in Catawba County.
