Hello Everyone! To all the mamasitas Happy Mother's Day. Well today is Mother's day in Mexico. Today was another great day for me. My mom came home from school (English classes) and we decided to make a carne asada. It was a nice time. All my family was here my cousins from the back, my older bro Javi and his kids and also two of my friends came over. We ate carne asada, w/ rice and beans, guacamole, grilled chicken, tortillas, sandia, and also cheesecake and angel food cake with strawberries...yum..yum. We were also playing the UNO challenge game.  Tomorrow is going to be a busy day for me. (When isn't it??? lol) Tomorrow I am working at the middle school...Keep me in prayer. Middle school can be tuff sometimes. I also have a dentist appointment and at night I am meeting up with one of my friends. We are going out to dinner. Don't know yet but I hope it is a blessed time.
