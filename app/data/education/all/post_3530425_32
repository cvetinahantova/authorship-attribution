By far, the very best parody of the political season is at  urlLink JibJab  .  You've probably heard about it:  an all-star cast of political animations sings the 2004 version of  This Land is Your Land .  Woodie Guthrie would have loved it.  It's costing a fortune for them to distribute it, so click through the ads on their website.  And don't miss the blog -- it's funny too.
