I read this poem in New Internationalist (great mag - go buy it)  I don't understand it all but it kind of resonated with me. Even though it comes from a very different culture and situation to mine I think I heard the voice of God in it.  Create create create in mind create in muscle create in nerve create in man create in masses create create with dry eyes create create over the profanation of the forest over the brazen fortress of the whip create over the perfume of sawn trunks create create with dry eyes create create bursts of laughter over the derision of the palmatoria courage in the tips of the planters boots  strength in the splintering of battered-in doors firmness in the red blood of insecurity create create with dry eyes create create stars over the warriors sledgehammer peace over children's weeping peace over sweat  over the tears of contract labour peae over hatred create create peace with dry eyes create create create freedom in the slave stars manacles of love on the paganized paths of love festive sounds over the swinging bodies on the simulated gallows  Create  create love with dry eyes.  Agostinho Neto, Angola 'Create' from Sacred Hope by Agostinho Neto, Tanzania Publishing House  (about Agostinho Neto NI writes "The NI described Agostinho Neto as the quintessential example of the poet as revolutionary, spinning his dreams and inspirational calls to arms from inside prison cells and given the chance to turn imagination to reallity as the first President of independent Angola")
