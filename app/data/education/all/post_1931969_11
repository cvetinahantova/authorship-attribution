Well,   Now that King Otto I and his band of underpaid (according to European standards), underestimated, and misrepresented players have won the Euro2004,  Now that the lights have been switched off finally and everyone had a chance to drown his happiness or sorrow,  Now that the big question is "will he stay or will he go back to Germany?",  I would like to remind all those ill-mannered, bad-tempered weirdos who did not believe in the team (both in Greece and abroad) the old adage that says:   Offense wins games, but defense wins championships .
