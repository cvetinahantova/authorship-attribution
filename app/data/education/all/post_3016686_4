FINALLY!  The first really exciting music of 2004 is here! It's unexpected too - the previously obtuse  John Frusciante  (of Red Hot Chili Peppers / toothless addict fame) has released a beautiful new CD called "Shadows Collide With People"   Seems like he's taken quite a leap with this record.  According to Lisa, his last solo records were unlistenable noise / noodlings. This one is chock full of strong melodies, Cali alt-pop-rock arrangements and surprisingly good singing.  It's a wee bit too long- 19 tracks, including some instrumentals, that could have been cut by about 4.  The details are there too: the sparing use of vocoder on "The Slaughter" intro, the strong vocals on "Carvel" and the lovely eat-your-heart-out-Richard-Ashcroft lyrics / music of "Ricky." The sound of the CD is reminiscent of the very good 2002 RHCP record "By The Way" - minus their lingering funk and occasionally irritating Anthony Keidis raps.   His  urlLink website  has three full tracks including the aforementioned epic "Carvel" (as in ice cream cake!) - a freaking amazing driving-around-California-in-a-convertible song. That may end up in my top ten songs of the year, at least at the rate we're going so far.  Just click on the Play Music cloud on the main page.   Have been so uninspired by music lately... until this. I urge you to check it out!
