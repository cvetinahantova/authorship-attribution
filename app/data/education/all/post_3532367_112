I spent pretty much the whole of yesterday eating. Crisps, biscuits, snacks, fruit, dinners, puddings, chips....the list goes on and today I feel fat, but I'm still hungry.  Last night Sandra and I spent some time trying to find a cottage to holiday in during October. Sandra feels guilty that she is spending money, but I pointed out that we will need to spend some money on ourselves, we need a break and it will be the first time it will be paid for before we go.  Last night was pants. No sleep at all from 04:00 - again! Didn't get up, although I was very tempted this time. The trouble is, I could fall asleep standing up now, I'm shattered!
