Could someone please tell me if the creaters of the latest GTA will be creating a complete engine for the game or will they be using the same engine just making the skins on the people different and making some of their actions different. The last thing that i wanted to know is have the creaters started creating the game yet or are they finishing off a project then starting it, if so how long will it take before they get a demo out to the greater public.
