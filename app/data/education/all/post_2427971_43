turns the light off to get out what he wants, hes consumed... the glare of the screen hurts his eyes, yet he stares without blinking for minutes on end... there is no way out, leave now or suffer. spin, get up and walk... the cusions are there for you, they keep you safe and keep you warm. just stop, do what you should be doing... stop everything and give in, dont listen to the others, dont listen to anyone else but yourself... or is it better to listen to the others. whats beyond the darkness, it has to stop... there has to be an end to it, find the bottom and be content. find the bottom and be complete. find the bottom... then what, whats after that.. go back to what, the warm places? there are no warm places other that the arms you wish to be held in, no others... keep your mind on everything and dont give, theres nothing stopping you. make it all make sense eventually, be sure to keep yourself intact and sane.. HA! no one is sane here... not a single person, theres is no way to get any better than you are... there is no changing, there is only hiding. eat the black spawn inside you and choke, choke to the point of no hope... dont drop them, hold them both up with sticks if you have to... sleep can wait, but you told them youd sleep... listening are you? or are you just hearing... doesnt make sense, theres no way its a possibility... take it all and stuff it away like always and the door will pop open after too long. take it all and burn it... Impossible...  Rants that make no sense even to the writer...
