Last night was hell. Hardly slept at all. Woke up at 01:00 and couldn't get settled back to sleep all night. It was really difficult trying to keep my hands off Sandra, but I managed it. We had discussed it earlier in the day and she said that it was due to time of day - morning too busy, evening too tired. I tried to ask her if we could have an early night, she said "don't know" which is her way of agreeing, without saying so. But by the time we got settled down it was 22:00 and she said she was too tired again and her peroid had started.   That just led to frustration and anger on my behalf, although I also felt vunerable - I think that this was down to me recongising for the first time that this was one of my problem areas. I was very aware of my reaction to being denied the "chemical highs" the doctor had been on about and was ashamed of it in a way.
