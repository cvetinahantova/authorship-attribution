SALUTE TO THE MIDDLE FINGER   me and my homies (circa drew's bachelor party)    jesse is not happy with me (circa junior year may '01).  neat, huh?  I found out how to post pictures.  guess what else I'm done with.  convenience and instant gratification.  yeah, 1-hour photo.  i don't think so.  I paid 2 bucks extra a roll for next day photo.  i'm done with all of it fast food.  microwaves.  email.  internet.  caffine.  whatever.  done.
