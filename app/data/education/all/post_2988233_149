You know those days when you feel spent.  Just mentally spent.    I'm having one of those, and I don't really know why.  It is a gorgeous day, I took Tommy to work, then ran some errands and was fine.  Played outside with Savannah and the boys, watched a DVD.  BUt now, I feel the need of change.    How?  I know I'm not happy with my spiritual life.  I know I need to make some changes, like reading and praying more.  But right now, I know I need those things, I'm not sure I have the desire to do them.    I want a cigarette.  I quit 14 years ago when I found out I was pregnant with TJ.  cold turkey, I quit.  I started back after he was born, but then decided I was a moron for starting back and quit when he was 8 months old.  Havent' smoked one since.  Yeah for me.   This is bugging me, so I am gonna have to figure it out.  I just hope it doesn't take forever.
