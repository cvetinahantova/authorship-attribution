Studying too much    Â  Acck, so I have a test on monday, and basically have spent most of my day today, saturday, on studying. You think you learn a lot, and you think WOW, this field of Immunology is amazing and I know oh so much! But...but you don't! Gosh, the world of science. I asked my advisor, also my teacher for this course about this class, and she's like, Oh we'll go over lots, but there's a lot you'll still need to know! Oh well, it's all about continuous learning I suppose. No one ever knows everything they need to know about something. If that was the case, we'd all be ignorant...right right right?   Guess I better hit the books again :)
