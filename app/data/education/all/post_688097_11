Hey there! Im planning to use a new template that I found from a website that provides different site lay-outs. I will use it once I finish adding some finishing touches to it. There's also been loads of updates on my  urlLink Harry Potter  site, dont forget to visit it. But sadly, no updates from  urlLink FanMania2000 . Im also planning to get my own domain and have all my sites hosted in it. But I cant yet cause I dont have a credit card...maybe I can ask my sister.  Anyway, dont forget to visit my sites, and get in contact with me through e-mail; jcbylon@yahoo.com!
