I just sat with TOmmy while he read my blog.  It went really well.  He can't believe I posted about my shaving incident.    He also read the parts about how happy we all are about the happy pills.    Took that well too.    He mentioned a few details I could have put in the get together story.  Then cracked up because one thing he remembered, I definitly don't remember.    Let's jsut say it doesn't leave the best impression of me.  He loved it then, and still does.  I guess that is why he remembers it so well.
