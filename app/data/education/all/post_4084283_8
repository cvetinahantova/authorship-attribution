wENT swimming wif my fiance today.  Both of us had no mood to swim as the Bukit Batok swimming pool, although fabulous now, was much too crowded la!! How to swim! Half way across n we bump into a float.  Swim diagonally and we get kicked by a wild uncivilized leg! Swim vertically and the juniors swim dangerously wif no regards to me who s already half blind by my misty gonna-haf-to-chuck-it goggles! sigh.  Such s the danger both of us haf to face in the pool.  But the sun was fab! I and fiance feel so fab!!  Watching the repeat telecast of Anugerah now.  The RUFFEDGE is it? urm... they're more superb than I tot they were se! My fiance loves them since a long time back.  He's busy studying now.  I wish him well for his term test tomorrow.  His reservist is also tomorrow.  Sigh. I'm gonna miss him again.  I think we're in the love mood again.  When are we getting married? November next yr... few days before my b'day.  Hehe... den can spend my birthday together YEAH!  Meeting gal pals dis coming friday.  Wat shall we do? WOrkOut, Pig out or simply LAZE around? wat shall we do, wat shall we do?  Morro school! I miss my small sweetums!! Over and OUT!
