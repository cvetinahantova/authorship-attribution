urlLink Why waste originality when a truism will suffice   That was  urlLink this person's  response to the following quote,  urlLink "One man's cliche is another man's....uh....cliche." .  With that out of the way, I will tell everyone that is willing to listen my reasoning why this person would be regarded in public schooling as "special". First of all, he cannot even end a sentence with punctuation. Is that a question he is trying to pose? I don't know, there is no question mark. So I must assume that a series of idiotic statements that will form a SPED-like poem. But of course there is no way to tell.  Secondly, "truism" and "cliche" are basically the same word. But one of them sounds less harsh than the other. So just to make himself feel superior and lift his microscopic self esteem and ego, he uses the former.  Thirdly, he argues that using a cliche is a good thing. This in turn makes it fairly easy to believe that this imbecile has the following conversations:   Random person : How was your day?  "winner" : OK, I just have to take it one day at a time.  Random person : My day was fantastic.  "winner" : Well, every dog has its day.  Random person : Actually there was one thing that did not work out as expected. My dog broke her foot.  "winner" : Doggone.  Random person : But I did hook up with that girl across the street.  "winner" : Well, that takes the cake.  Random person : That wasn't all, then my dog did her dog on the porch all night long.  "winner" : Oy, vey!  I could go on and on, but you get the point. This person is a moron and this post is simply moronic.
