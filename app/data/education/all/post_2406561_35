My head hurts. Like, everyday of these few past weeks, I have headaches. EVERYDAY. It sucks. And I'm a chronic liar. L-iii-ar.   Christian was so funny today in Biology. Aha, the PUBES. THE PUBES. Then during the movie, I kept kicking Adrian, and Jolanda was being Jolanda. She hit me. What a biotch, only not really.   I'm currently in my "I hate myself" phase. Stupid movie, and the hidden messages. I feel so bad for yelling at Secoff. But it's Secoff.  Gag.   I question my ability to do anything.   Flings self into ocean.
