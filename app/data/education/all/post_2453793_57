so everyone makes mistakes here and there...like trying to fix a lamp, holding the part where all the wires are connected to screws and plugging it in to see if it works.  yes, needless to say, that is the mistake i made today and paid for it by getting a powerful surge of electricity up my arm and down my body.  for the majority of the day my arm was numb and tingly.  every time i'd touch something metal like a doorknob i got shocked again.  it was horrible.  i'm still not sure i have complete feeling back in my arm.  oh well...i'm sure it'll be good as new tomorrow morning.  anyway, i got a lot done today.  i got my mail and my spatula.  i found my missing shirt.  i got my car washed.  i bought a new wireless router (ours kind of sucked).  i went grocery shopping.  i ate at bruegger's bagels.  i bought a dozen bagels at bruegger's bagels to take home.  i took out all of the garbage and recycling.  i mixed some flower fertilizer and fed our dying plants.  i returned the usb hub i had bought.  i wrote valentine's cards to my grandparents and high school best friend.  i found a post office (only to find out they had already closed), bought postage in one of those little machines and mailed my letters.  attempted to fix a lamp and got shocked.  called my parents several times.  i also made keys for my tests and started to grade.  i watched say anything and the royal tennenbaums (sp?).  i balanced my accounts.  i think that's about it.  my roommate came home tonight and brought me a beautiful rose for valentine's day along with dark chocolate and white chocolate turtles (i don't like milk chocolate but i love the other two).  she is soooo incredibly sweet.  anyway, i should probably go socialize...we have a guest.  :)
