I've been trying to teach my dog to howl.  She's not a particularly loud dog, but will bark on occasion.  The game goes like this:  I howl, varying the inflection from loud to soft, high to low, and she wags her tail, sits by my feet and barks along, paying close attention, and soon enough she's  trying  to howl.  Her success varies, but the look on her face, the "Holy Shit!  You speak Dog?" it's priceless.
