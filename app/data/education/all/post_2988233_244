I am right now.    Today the boys did their state mandated testing for homeschool.  We had to be there at 8am, and I got to come home at 4pm.    I don't know if it is the stress from all 4 boys testing, or having extra kids at our church for testing, or playing hostess to all teh people I don't know, or what, but I am bushed.    The boys did ok.  TJ and Casey didn't do as well as they could have.  Will made a definate improvement over last year.  ANd Jamie did great.  I was so proud of him.    Casey had a huge case of nerves, and just shut down.  The testor knew it too.  She said she could tell he wasn't thinking clearly, some of the stuff he missed, there is no way on earth he should have missed it if his brain was functioning right.    TJ, well, he just didnt' try as hard as he shoud have.  Especially on the speed drills and stuff.  I think he froze, or got over confident.    Oh well, it is over for another year.  yay.
