Excerpt - "Today there are over one hundred laptop campuses. Most are in Canada and the United States. Within larger universities are another fifty-plus subgroups, especially colleges of business and engineering, that require commonly configured laptops of students and faculty in the programs. Beyond these universal laptop programs, we estimate that at least half of all colleges and universities in the United States are 'practicing ubiquity' -- that is, teaching proceeds on the assumption that every student and faculty member has appropriate access to the Internet. Ironically, the tight definition of ubiquitous computing no longer prevails because the concept itself has become ubiquitous."  The articles discusses the implications of a true tech savvy campus while relating the trials and tribulations of a few trailblazing college's and universities.
