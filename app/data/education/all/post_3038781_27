How are things going?   For a while, I popped off into rL to recover from work, finals, rl and other sundry stresses. But, I'm feeling much better now. The site's still not up. Everytime I try to get a start it seems like something else jumps in the way. But, I am still planning it, at least mentally, and hopefully a little mental refinement will only improve it's quality.  Hope every thing's going great with you.
