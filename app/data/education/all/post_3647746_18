It's crap like  urlLink this  that gives hippies a bad name:   Rock musician David Crosby , founding member of the Byrds and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, pleaded guilty Friday to a gun charge, was fined $5,000 and sentenced to a conditional discharge.  The singer was arrested March 6 at the DoubleTree Suites Hotel in midtown Manhattan. Police said they found a Colt .45-caliber handgun, three clips of .45-caliber ammunition and two knives in his luggage.  Police also said the musician had a plastic bag containing an ounce of marijuana, a wooden container with a marijuana cigarette in it, a package of cigarette rolling papers and two other plastic containers with marijuana residue.   What a shame.  All the lovely music he's made and the mass movement of love and peace that he was a part of is overshadowed by the ridiculous behavior of an old drug addict.  Way to go, Dave.  More talking points for chronically uptight fascists in training.  There are no perfect humans that I know of.  For every David Crosby there's a  urlLink Jack Ryan.
