Indy - Yesterday - Being at the Colts game, and although we lost, it was great to be with such an amazing group of people.  I lost a bet to friend Ed Gerety since he picked the Patriots.  Another motd was at church last night as we enjoyed being with Carolyn and attending an open discussion with Kent Millard about the upcoming Methodist Conference next year.
