I got a huge surprise tonight.   My SIL is taking Tommy, Me, and the boys to the beach.   We haven't had a vacation since we got married.  16 years no vacation.  I haven't minded, but this totally has me stoked.  I have been to the beach once in my life.  The summer I turned 18, my best friend and I declared "road trip" and took off.  A solid week, me, her, beach, it was amazing.   I loved it.   I would move to the beach if I could.  To fall asleep each night with the sound of waves slowly rocking me to sleep.  Waking each morning to  the smell of the mist coming from the water.  I would love it.  SO, now, in Sept.  The weekend of my birthday to be exact, we are taking off for Myrtle beach.   When I told th kids, it shocked them so bad, they didn't know how to react.  Now, they are all bugging me to death.  Especially Noah, he wants to know how many fingers until we leave.  Bless his heart.   Now, I get to hit the summer clearance sales, with practically no money, and try to get us set for the trip.  Tommy needs trunks, shorts, and shoes.  We won't even go to what all the boys need.  And mom, ahhhh,  I can't even start to think of that.   I'm still excited though.  Very.
