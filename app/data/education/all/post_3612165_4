h-dropping  h-dropping occurs initially in words like hit, hammer, happy, hedge (examples in this section are from Wells p.253 ff.). It can also (though less frequently) occur mediall in words such as Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Tatham.  In most accents of English underlying /h/ is realised phonetically as [h]. The underlying /h/ often contrasts with zero to produce morpheme alternation. Thus we find hall vs. all and heat vs. eat.  Note: [h] is a  voiceless glottal fricative - or, in other words, vowel without vocal cord vibration and with added frication. In most cases [h] is a voiceless frication-rich version of the immediately following vowel.  In some accents of English underlying /h/ is often realised as zero, or sometimes as a glottal stop. Wells (p.253) refers to this happening in 'most of the working-class accents' (p.253). He sets out two models:   there is an underlying /h/ (our model) which is deleted,   there is no underlying /h/.   For us, hall and all are phonologically distinct (hall has the underlying /h/, but all does not), whereas in the alternative model there is no underlying /h/ for hall - thus making it identical at all levels with all.  Word initial h-dropping occurs in RP (Received Pronunciation) and CE (Cockney English), though not in SE (Standard English) or EE (Estuary English) [the four accents this course concentrates on]. Most accents of English will regularly zero word medial  /h/ in examples such as Nottingham, though this is usually not obligatory.  Hypercorrection can often occur (when trying to 'talk posh'). Here a word with an underlying stressed vowel may well have a [h] 'mistakenly' inserted.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [ i ] becomes [ I ]  In almost all accents of English [ i ] has replaced [ I ] in final position in words such as happy or coffee. Another way of saying this is that in word-final position the vowel is realised phonetically as  more tense than it used to be. This has been a gradual shift since the Second World War (at least) and has been noted in particular in accents of North America and Britain.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  l-vocalisation  In English there is a single underlying /L/. That is, at the underlying level of the phonology (or at a phonemic level) there is only a single l-category entry. A phonological rule (note: not a phonetic one) substitutes a palatal /l/ (or clear /l/) before a vowel and a velar /l/ (or dark /l/) before a consonant or in word-final position. Phonetically these go on to be realised as phonetic clear or dark [l].  The process of l-vocalisation means that dark /l/ becomes phonetically a non-syllabic vowel rather like the one in SE book. In some speakers the process is so strong that, when heavily stressed, the vowel may take on the characteristics of a syllabic vowel (i.e. the nucleus of a separate syllable). In these cases a word like wall can become bi-syllabic for some speakers (especially CE speakers).  EE, SE and RP are all seeing the introduction of the trend toward l-vocalisation - with the degree of penetration greatest in EE and least in RP. Wells compares this trend with the earlier r-dropping in words like car or better (p.259) in terms of its impact on the pronunciation of the language.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  glottalisation  The voiceless plosives [p, t, k] are often preceded in some accents by a glottal stop. The phenomenon is referred to as 'pre-glottalisation' or 'glottal reinforcement', and according to Wells seems to be a 20th century phenomenon. The effect occurs  when [p, t, k and the voiceless alveolar affricate] come in syllable final position   when [p, t, k and the voiceless alveolar affricate] are preceded by a vowel, a liquid or a nasal.  [A list of example environments can be found in Wells, p.260.]  Although some speakers of RP, SE and EE sometimes use glottal reinforcement it is commonest in the north, around Newcastle. It seems to be a regional phenomenon, and accents of London (CE), Glasgow and Edinburgh as well, according to Wells, many rural accents of southern England (e.g. East Anglian accents) is gaining ground, particularly in reinforcing [t].  But it is important to distinguish between glottal reinforcement and glottal substitution. In some accents, particularly CE, glottal substitution takes place. Here there is a complete replacement of [p, t] with a glottal stop - with no residual of the oral stop articulation. The replacement of [t] is more likely than [p], and occurs only infrequently with [k]. Some researchers report glottal substitution in northern accents around Leeds and Manchester.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -ing variation  -ing variation refers to a surface variation quite commonly observed between [n] and [ng] in final position in words such as running, making.   [Note: [ng] is used here for the velar nasal to substitute for the usual IPA symbol which may not be available in some web browsers.]  It is also possible for the entire syllable to be reduced (when unstressed) to a syllabic [n] - the 'true' vowel disappearing altogether. As Wells points out (p.262) this can result in some pairs of otherwise phonetically distinct words becoming homophonous, e.g. eating and eaten. According to Wells  At the present day it seems that almost every English-speaking community exhibits a social or stylistic alternation between the two possibilities, the form with the velar nasal being 'high' and that with the alveolar being 'low'. But there is evidently geographical variation in respect of the point in social or stylistic stratification at which the changeover occurs. In Birmingham, England, it appears that the velar form extends well down into working-class speech, while in Birmingham, Alabama, the alveolar form extends well up into middle-class or educated speech. (p.262-263)  Note that as with h-dropping hypercorrection occurs with this phenomenon. It is not uncommon to hear the words chicken or garden pronounced with the velar nasal. This is often associated with CE in the minds of many English speakers  - partly because CE is automatically associated with working-class speech. Hypercorrection never occurs in RP, and seems to occur only rarely in SE or EE.
