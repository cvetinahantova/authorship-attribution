Still off work, but planning to go back tomorrow as being home alone is actually giving me rage and making me feel quite down in the dumps.  Thankfully it seems that I don't have Norwalk at all: I phoned the doctor and he said that I didn't have enough of the symptoms. What I do have the symptoms of, however, is someone who has recently had several different dyes and medications injected into her. So it's just a side-effect of those tests they did on me. Phew. Although, to be honest, I do feel a lot better today. It's still uncomfortable to breathe in too deeply, but I should be ok soon. I never thought I'd say that I missed work, but there we go. Bronte was a little too rough with her playing today and clamped her teeth on either side of my finger. It didn't hurt in the slightest - she literally wrapped her whole jaw around it and I could feel her teeth meet on the other side, but she's never done that before. I think she was getting too excited. Just typing up some worksheets to help my year 9's with their SATs revision. I'm not terribly hopeful about that class, but their attitude is largely to do with it. Anyway, I'd better press on.
