I ran the 5k race last night. I was top 15 for girls, and I got 23:38 for just over three miles. That's better than I did last year for Cross-Country. Must be all the running. So then I stay up until 2:30AM because I just couldn't get to sleep, and I came to regret it this morning when I woke up at six to go run five miles with Kendra.   Now I've just got to go to the 9AM mass for church, then I can come home and sleep through the hot hours of the day and go driving in the afternoon. I wonder where I am on the countdown for learners permit. You have to be 15 and 9 months...so I think I've got just under eight months left till I can officially get my learners permit. Driving isn't so bad, but I'd much rather run...but I don't think I could run to school...   Called your name today But no one answers anymore You turned and ran away Like someone came and locked the door  Paper pieces lyin' on the floor I fall to pieces now The coffee's black and  My heart is sore  Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor  Since you left that day I've realized my mind's made up on you My heart is capsized and  I dont know what I'm gonna do  Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Paper pieces on the floor and I call out to youu but you turn yes you turn away  I called your name today but no one answers anymore  Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Pick me up, tape me together Like paper pieces on the floor Paper pieces on the floor
