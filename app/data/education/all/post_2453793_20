so, maybe i'm over-reacting a bit but isn't it a little soon to spend the night at some strange guys house the same night you meet him?  i guess maybe they just hit it off so well that they know they belong together?  i don't know.  maybe they are both just looking for a one-night stand?  i'm just so confused.  i only hope that i can't hear them messing around through my wall tonight.  what did feel good though is that i didn't feel like i wanted to be with him when i saw them together...not even the slightest bit...and i think that means a lot.  i think it proves that i am truly over him.  i've known that i was over him for a while, but you never really know if the feelings are still there until there is proof.  although it sort of disturbs me that all 3 of the guys are awstruck by her.  she's not even really that attractive, but i guess she is different.  she has a lip piercing and is kind of goth.  that's not why i don't think she's that attractive.  i just didn't really think she was all that pretty.  anyway, i think he said that she works at hot topic and she definitely fits the description of most hot topic employees.  she also has some kind of texan accent...and me and texas just don't get along (no offense to anyone from texas that might stumble upon this).  but i'm sure she has a great personality, which is what drew him to her in the first place.  i really can't make any conclusions about her since i don't really know her, and she did seem fairly friendly.  i just get a weird feeling about her...a gut feeling that something bad is going to happen.  what i think is the strangest thing though is that she is the girl from a dream that i had a few days after thanksgiving.  only in my dream she had long black hair...with red streaks.  but everything else is exactly her...no doubt about it.  it's really eerie.  anyway, i guess i should go to sleep.  my sister just showed me another  urlLink  pokey comic   to cheer me up.  you're lucky...2 pokey's in one day!
