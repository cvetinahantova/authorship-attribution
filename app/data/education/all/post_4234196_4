Well, my adventures at CSU are done for the day.  I paid my summer tuition bill, as well as my Graduate School Application Fee, which I had somehow forgotten long ago.  I also submitted all of the rest of the papers that needed to be turned in to Randi.  Donna was not available, so I am to call Randi on Monday to see if the Grad School application is all ok and I am admitted and ready to register.    If this happens on Monday, I can still get my online registration done for most of my classes.  I will still have to go through the override process, but that should be easy.  I also talked with Teresa Yohon about our Business Methods class, starting next Tuesday at 3:10.  It is in room 229 of the Education Building.  I told her about my registration issues and she said not to worry.  I also ran into Mauricio at the Education Building, but none of the other PP staff were around.  I am going to try to get to the FAC this evening at Kylie's house.  I might have to bring the kids and will only be able to stay for a little while, but it would be good to see everyone again and hear stories.
