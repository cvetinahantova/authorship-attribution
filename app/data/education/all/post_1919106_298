And it was everything I expected it to be. If you don't recognize the quote, then you should go see Office Space.  I needed a rest. For the last month or so I've been getting up regularly at 8 am (for those that don't know me, that's some 4 hours sooner than normal for me) and that's really been putting the drain on me. So I went to bed early last night. And slept in today. I'd say that I put in some 12 hours of continuous sleep. Then I had some tasty lunch, and went for another nap. So, now that I'm all nice and freshened up, I think I'll start working on the project that's due... Uhh... Friday? Some time around that. The good thing is that I already know what I need to write down. The bad thing is that it takes a fricken' long time. And with the last final coming up on Monday, and the Operating Systems coordinator wanting the assignments back on Wednesday, I won't have much free time this week... Again. But the week after that should be fun. Concerts, heavy drinking, and hitting on pretty ladies. My kidneys will hate me afterwards, I know, but that's way too far into the future to worry about.  Hmm... I think I should be going to bed again, and skip dinner in favor of a nice breakfast. With bacon. Can't have breakfast without bacon.
