a few people have astutely noted that lara just isn't quite happy unless she has a roadtrip in the works... well check out the margin, now there's a bunch in the works!  *"top secret roadtrip" in may... several of you know about it, but some shouldn't yet, (so i can be all surprising and stuff)... excited about that *memphis roadtrip -- dentist, renew license plates, and fun stuff like that  but the most exciting one...  *vegas roadtrip... this probably needs explanation, especially as i don't have a summer job planned yet... eric's going home (to las vegas, yes, the one in nevada) for the first half of the summer... when he returns, he plans to bring back a car instead of just flying.  eric's not as gung ho about roadtrips as me, so he also wants company for the trip... sooo, we've been joking about me flying out there and being his roadtrip buddy to bring the car back, but today we pinky swore on it and agreed to set specific dates and book me a flight in the near future... vegas, grand canyon, and for sure at least a handful of new states in the "great out west"... this shall be a party.  how's the homework?  leigh and i worked for 4 hours and eric joined us for the last 1.5 or so... we got the two "easy" problems done in that time... maybe i'm slow, but i did it myself without major help and know what's going on... joy. =P  sleep time. night y'all!
