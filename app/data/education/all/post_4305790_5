I am frustrated at my webmaster's lack of cooperation in creating a blog for my organization. I'm the vice-chairperson for National University of Singapore's Students Against Violation of the Earth (NUS SAVE), and I have many ideas. But my webmaster loathes implementing those ideas. I may assume too much, but he did not include any blog-like mechanism in the original SAVE website. You can check it out  here . I am tired of arguing with him, so I just implement my own suggestion in the form of this blog.  This blog will discuss about the environment, links to environmental websites and stories relevant to the environment. I hope you find them educational.
