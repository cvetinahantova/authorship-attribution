Tired... Want to go to sleep... Can barely keep my eyes open... Must stay awake... x_x I'm sleepy, but I can't fall asleep now because if I do, and then my dad wakes me up when he comes home (yeah, I'm home alone), I'd never be able to go back to sleep again..-_- Basically, I have to keep myself awake. Yeah..  Yesterday, I was at the States with my parents. My parents bought some stuff in some stores, I bought books in Borders:  Airframe  by Michael Crichton, and Dilbert comic books. Dilbert is the coolest comic ever!! :D I bought a three book in one volume thing for $5.99 US, it was on sale. Hehee ^__^.Dilbert is soo cool! I will go read them now. :)  * Here is the  Site of the Day :  urlLink Dibert's Offical Website . Enjoy!
