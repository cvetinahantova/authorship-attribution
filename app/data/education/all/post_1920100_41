My Divided Heart:  Psalm 86:11-13 " Teach me your way, O Lord, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name." "I will praise you, O Lord my God with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever. For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths of the grave."  Psalm: 119:37-38 " Turn my eyes away from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word. Fulfill your promise to your servant, so that you jmay be feared."  It's amazing how God reveals our hearts but at the same time it is peaceful to know he is with us and will provide us with the grace. He is the heart knower and changer. Thanks for those of you who have been praying for me and for all the encouragement. Gio you have truly been a friend. Thanks your amiga.
