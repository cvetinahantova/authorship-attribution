I guess I need to get up to speed here... Local Moe is a fellow I met on a personal site, not eHarmony.  He mailed me first... and back and forth a bit.  I sent a picture, and he wanted to meet - right away.  We went for coffee on Friday.  Turns out I've dated (kinda) one of his best friends.  More of a friends with bennies guy, JC and I have been flirting and exchanging a kiss here and there for almost a year.  I wouldn't mind taking it to the next level with JC, but he is more of a play the fielder.  I can only imagine the look on my face when Local Moe said do you know JC, one of my best buddies?  ACK!    So Local Moe and I hung out for almost 2 hours and as soon as I got in the car I called JC.  Buddy I love ya but... please!  don't tell, and give me the 411 on your bud.    I emailed LMoe and said thanks, great to meetcha.  Same back at me... now I'm waiting for his turn to come around and email me now.  I'm into him.  He is cute funny and all that other stuff.  Kids great, family great, all the package is complete.  How much you want to bet he is not interested?     Well, I always have JC as a backup... LOL
