Wow what a week! Kids having nervous breakdowns at work, almost getting in a million head on collisions on Wednesday and then totaling my car and leaving myself in not too great of a condition either. It was Ledford day at the ER. I walk into the ER and I see Jamie and Bobbie back there because Bobbie got his nose broken in a fight. He got cheap-shotted and he looks horrible. And I am just chilling, and then my beautifulist Amanda comes in there looking very very upset with some ish with her grandpa and probably seeing me with blood all over my neck and two other people from our school didn't help.  I got out pretty good considering how fast I got hit and especially since it was in my driver's side door. I am sooooo freaking sore and it isn't gonna get any better anytime soon. lol. Ah well. I got some glass in my eye and an abrasion on it and something is messed up with my cornia (however you spell that). If I didn't go to the hospital last night I probably would have went blind on it, as I am told, but it is getting better so hopefully I won't have to have any more surgery on it. Summer is getting near again and I am gonna miss not being able to work until I am better. I have no new emotional drama to say and my eye hurts, so I'm off to bed.
