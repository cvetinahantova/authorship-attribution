urlLink    I feel like posting, yet i don't really feel like writing today. I'm so tired. So so tired... i was asked why i have bags under my eyes today. Why? I have no idea! I've been going to bed early, having not done anything homework-wise either (so the teachers just  love  me right now!), and really not being able to drag myself out of bed in the morning. I don't even know why i'm bothering to go into school, i mean, i'm not feeling well half the time. And yet, the other half of the time i feel ok... so there seems no solution. Just carrying on is what i seem to do, and eventually i get better again.  Beth said something quite funny the other day. It was about her brother Stevyn and his friend Ed - Beth told me ages ago they both fancy me, but she told me that she asked Steve since when has he liked me. Steve said that he'd always sort of liked me a little, but when i came up their stairs in my mini-mini-skirt (when they were playing their guitars) they exchanged glances like... :Â¬o! I just thought that that was soo funny, since i had no idea at the time!  This lead me to think about something i've often wondered; how do you qualify having 'nice legs'? I've never really been able to work it out! ...  Posted by  urlLink Hello   (edited with  urlLink Blogger )
