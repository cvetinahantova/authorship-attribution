Now this issue won't actually have anything to do with showers or naps, but the concept is the same as sunshine and walks in the park, or wildflowers and puppies... happy images, more commonly accepted than my usuals (thunderstorms and sex, lol).  I had the best day yesterday.  I was so comfortable and happy and smiley, and today shouldn't be any different.  It's just one lazy day after another.  My family is going out to the mall in Durham, because me and Jonathan are supposed to be going to a movie when he gets back from Kari's sister's wedding... he's supposed to call me and let me know, because his mom has a crop tonight and he doesn't know which car he's going to have... but it should be good nonetheless.  Even if he just comes over and hangs out, I like hanging out with his Liberal-Nazi butt(-crack face), lol... too many insiders there... I know, I know.  It feels so good to be back at a computer with a "1" key without tobacco juice on it... I'm so glad I can put some actual exclaimation marks in my post this time...  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, sorry, was a little obsessed for a minute there.  Dad and Mom are watching something about Da Vinci... It's pretty impressive.  They're trying to prove that Da Vinci was a genius .. though that's something that we already knew isn't it?  I mean, I've always thought of his as a genius.  There has never been many other words I could use to adequately describe him.  The were talking about  The Last Supper , how the original was done on this plaster.. the moisture in the plaster rose and the paint he used to do the picture, cracked... restorations sometimes did more harm than good... it's a ghost painting now .. but it's a wonderful ghost.  Geez, I wish Jonathan would go ahead and call, I'm getting bored and my family is getting ready to leave, and ... GEEZ.  I'm freakish about being home alone.  I have to have the T.V. on and be on the computer at the same time or I just can't stand it, I'm always consciencious of being here alone... like I feel like someone's watching me, but of course, no one's there so I can't figure out where the feeling is coming from!!  I have to find something to preoccupy myself when they leave (if he's not here yet, obviously...)    Well, I'm going to make a doll... or try to at least.  I'll write more later!
