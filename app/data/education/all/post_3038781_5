Last night an online classmate [or a class mate from my online class (MBA at UOPhx)]  described my writing style in one post as dissection. I love it.    Dissection Anyone?   Or maybe, I just love the image/thought of me in surgeon's blues, cap, gown, mask, and booties leaning over my old, defunct, pooh-let hacker lap top, scalpel in hand... cutting class posts... and pasting my responses with liquid band-aid.    [Oops, I just read back over that description ... add the pants, surgeon's slacks, or something, I'm definately wearing those]. Otherwise it would just be just plain weird.   Now the real question is  did I remember the anesthesia?
