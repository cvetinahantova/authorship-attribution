I stayed up until 3 last night... I looked like this when my mother in law woke me up at 8:30 with the phone:  >_  Went to the parade (yay!), came home and had lunch, finished J's golf clubs, went to the store to buy fabric, made a CUTE new purse!   Linky--> urlLink Outside!  Linky--> urlLink Inside!   I can't wait to make more and do things like add POCKETS and stuff...change the ways the purse strap goes, different closures etc... :)  Sorry folks, if you want the new password, you have to IM me.  Stalkers are idiots. SO if you don't have my IM, you can't get the password. :P  Yay, me! :)  Other than that, I have nothing new to say. ;)  We're not going to the fireworks this evening but that's okay...because it is 58 frickin' degrees out here. It never topped 65 degrees today...stupid 4th of July weekend Wisconsin weather. :( boo.
