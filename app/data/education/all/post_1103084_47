Friends and Family!  Welcome to my blog.  It's not organized very conveniently.  Tho' this is going to be the site where I plan to keep track of the mundane bits of life that matter -- I also intersperse these mundanities with (*VERY LONG*) musings and meditations.  Feel free to fast forward past...(as if you wouldn't on your own...)  The idea that I keep this space as my "back burner" is supposed to allow me to keep a bunch of ideas simmering for a long time -- as they develop in my mind -- and now, hopefully, in community, and (theoretically) allow me to stay focused on my "real life" -- the "front burners" as it were.   Certainly that whole metaphor and the ascendant values are worth consideration on a different day!  Glad you're here!  Let me know (or not)!  Peace~
