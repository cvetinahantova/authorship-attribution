just read a couple of my first posts and am now embarrassed for how stupid i sounded *cringe*, reminds me of the kind of people i cant stand... the entries have been fun and all, i guess. nice to have somewhere to write, dont have to talk to anyone but myself. ive been working hard for my dad and making a bunch of money, havent been getting enough sleep and am wearing down. i think ive been lifting the wrong way and hurting my back, so today it just decided to explode on me... its got to be one of the most painful things ive felt for a long time, when it gave out i hit the floor. other than that the weekends are really nice for sleep ;P ive got one more drivers ed class and 3-4 practice drives after that, then i get to go home!!! thats gonna be the best part of my summer, i know.. i havent been home since the beginning of summer minus a couple days... this summer must be karma from last summer, cause its sucking. if i could go back to germany with everyone again id do it in a heartbeat, god that was the most fun ive ever had. words can not display how much fun i had in that trip, so much crazy shit happened. i posted allÂ about it somewhere on my blog, so its there if you care to find out, i wanna do it again!.. just realized today that i had sun burns on my back after my brother slapped me, nice to know. i ordered a nice mp3 player couple days ago, will be good for drowning out the guy i work with >.o think im gonna try to get some sleep, if i can get up >.
