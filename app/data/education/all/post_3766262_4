I did it, I fell of the veggie boat and into meat-land during my trip home.  It started slow, with a slice of honey-turkey from the fridge, then a sausage link.  On Nantucket, I spotted the ultimate betrayal of veggie-hood: the homemade hamburger on a hard roll, complete with onions, tomatos and a pickle.  I knew then, as I saw the woman at the next table take a whopping , juicy/greasy bite that I was going to finally do it.  Yup, I ate the whole burger, bun grease and all.  And I have to tell you, it was damn good!                                                                                    urlLink Today , I dove into a Turkey Club, and old favorite, and was amazed at how much mayo was present.  Why?  Why on earth do people need to slab white goop onto bread before they apply white meat and bacon?  I'll never understand.  Now I'm sleepy, probably a post-turkey effect, which I haven't experienced in years.  I'll try to resist napping, so that I can on the plane this evening.  We'll see.  Adios CT!
