urlLink [Thou art] a fusty nut with no kernel!    Well it certainly sounds worse than it should be.  My head hurts. I've been putting too much work into this paper. The good thing however is that it will all be over tonight. And then I'm going home and will make myself a good dinner, pork chops and mashed potatoes. With just the right amount of butter and salt. And garlic, can't leave the garlic out.  And with that I leave thee,  Thou surly elf-skinned flap-dragon!
