At last we found Tina's baggage, actually our lives revolve aroud it till we found it, it was too important for tina that even our own solitude was disturbed because of that! :-) I visited the doctor and she told me that I have cough allergy(triggered especially during extreme init or lamig) so I just have to live with it--drink my medicine, a lot of water and fruits. Last saturday Jorge called up..I was so happy that my happiness cannot be contained! But I am worried as well because he has I think flu and cough and his physical, emotional, psychological state is perhaps still adjusting to everything there... I hope everything is fine with him. I do!  Sunday was a day of worship and thanksgiving, so we attended the 5:oo pm mass. It was very refletive then, the Gospel was about the importance of persons over material things or goods of this world. Then I remembered what does it matter if you have all the things in this world, the money, material things but you are so lonely, so unhappy..ano ang magiging kabuluhan ng lahat ng yun. In the first place they are all temporary-- "of this world" when we die we cannot bring them. SO I reflected on it, what is so essential afterall in life?  Ano nga ba ang pinakamahalaga sa mundo?  pakikipag-kapwa tao, pagiging mapagmahal, tapat  and above all I am able to see the  interconnectedness  of one another and everything else in this world in relation to a God that we have faith in.  Hey is this doing Theology?! ha ha ha.  Mahal ko, i love you.  JO
