I love Netflix. We have been members since December of 2000. It has been wonderful to rent DVD's online, pay no shipping or late fees and have them sent directly to your home. We wait for those lovely red envelopes to come, watch as soon as humanly possible so we can send it out and get another. We started with the 3 out at a time plan and we are now on the 5 out at a time. If you have never heard of Netflix, or would like to know more, check it out. http://www.netflix.com/  Now, Blockbuster started there mail program. Like Blockbuster doesn't already suck. They stick you every which way. They had that 2 day rental, then opened Hollywood Video which allowed 5 day rentals, what does Blockbuster do, change policy. Netflix opened (years ago) now Blockbuster wants part of that too. Hey Blockbuster, do something orginal would you? They have already closed most of the little video places on the corner, ya know, the one's where the guy would hold a movie for you because he knew you were coming in. Wal-Mart (don't EVEN get me started) wants a piece too. I guess it is easy to steal people's ideas. (Wal-mart seems to have "borrowed" something from iTunes too!). I don't get it. Leave the little guy alone. Isn't that what this country is all about, the American Dream. You can make it here. You can be and do anything you want if you work hard enough. Well, only if Wal-Mart or Blockbuster or some other monsterishly huge company doesn't want a piece of that action.  I can only hope that Netflix has built up enough devoted customers that don't mind paying a mere few dollars more for EXCELLENT service. Isn't that what a return customer is all about? Remember all the wonderful Mom and Pop stores? Me neither! We need to bring them back. Check it out, http://www.netflix.com/, and maybe you can see why we are so happy with it.
