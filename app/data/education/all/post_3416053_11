Did you ever notice that whoever stands next to Bush in a photo-op gets screwed by the administration?   About ten times in the last year Bush has visited a program for a photo-op just before the administration cut funding for the program.  The most famous case was when he cut Job Corps right after a speech praising the program.  What's even funnier are the press conferences announcing the next round of tax cuts or the next initiative, always posed on the stage are people who will NEVER receive any benefits from the announced legislation.  One time his staff couldn't track down construction workers before a shoot so they passed out hard hats to lobbyists.  Not very often that you see construction workers in Armani suits...  Well, you may be wondering where all this is leading;  I can't help but remember the press conference leading up to the war with the prime ministers of Spain and England.  After 2 years of war the Spanish government has been replaced, Blair is in deep doo-doo; and while Hussein is in US custody, the US government is restoring Baathists to their government positions.  I also remember Chalabi appearing with Bush at a State of the Union address, and now US troops are searching his house for evidence.  It occurs to me that we might save a lot of lives and money by simply having Bush do photo-ops with anybody we want to get rid of.
