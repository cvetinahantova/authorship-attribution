The World To One Dying    A s these eyes travel here, there and all around,  N othing of any interest to me do I find, none at all.  A  world full of emptiness and blankness I see.   C almly going to and fro, my heart barely feeling,  A nd my soul blindly searching, I trip and fall,  L ike a leaf slow-ly fall-ing, I fight to see.  M y blessed world, dear God, at last I find and see.  A las, what great waste, I had to die if only to see!
