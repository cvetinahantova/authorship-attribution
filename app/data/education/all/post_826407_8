Been thinking a lot about I quote from 'The Divine Conspiracy' about living for an audience of one (ie. God).  So often when I do anything its either with concerns or hopes about what other people will think.  Does it make me look cool or stupid?  Does it make me look a good Christian.  I find it too easy to live looking for a reward here rather than from God.  But at the end of the day only the oneï¿½s evaluation will matter.
