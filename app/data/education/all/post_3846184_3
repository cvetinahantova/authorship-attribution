I've finally decided it's time to start a blog of my own...it'll be slow to start and sparse for a while, especially since we leave in two days for a week's visit to the in-laws, but I decided to follow in Christine's footsteps and try out this blogging thing. Hopefully I won't be far behind her in getting pregnant (for good) again soon, too...thanks for showing me the way, Christine! :)
