On Sunday night when I was in Max's room,  we somehow decided to wake up at 6.00am every morning to do our devotion.       I was sleeping in their room that night and I managed to wake up on time yesterday, though I slept less than 5 hours.       But yesterday I had a good rest in the afternoon and slept early at night yet I couldn't wake up in time this morning!!! I can't even remember when did I turned off the alarm on my phone!        I 'm really unsatisfied with myself. I'm out here far from my home, and everyday I rely on God's help to pull me through. Yet I've not been spending as much time in my devotion as I used to. Hopefully this is not the beginning of my fall : (        During the cell group last Friday, they was this speaker who said something about passion. We use the word "passion" ever so often yet do we really know what it means? We hear people saying they're passionate about this and that, yet do they really know what they're saying?       According to the speaker, referring to "The Passion of the Christ", the word 'passion' here actually means 'suffering'.       So, how many of us are actually willing to suffer for something?           What the speaker said really struck me on the head. I'm passionate about God, yet am I not even willing to wake up early to spend time with Him?        So, I'll try to do better in the future, maybe I'll join (at least once) the early morning prayer meeting  in Korea :)
