Update on the dog, he is doing much better.    He took a lonnnnnnggggg nap.  Got up went straight to pee, came in, ate, then did the other business, and is now napping again.    So all of his bodily functions seem to be working, I bet he has one heck of a headache though.  Phew, that is a relief.   Scrufty is 5 months old, and Labrador Retriever mix of some sort.  We had another lab, Jesse for 13 years, she died two years ago of  cancer.  So we waited a long time before getting another dog.  We had a Jack Russell Terrier for a very short time, then someone kidnapped him.  So for Son #3's birthday he asked for a dog, we went to a dog rescue place and instantly fell in love.    He was the first puppy I made eye contact with, but I didn't tell my boys.  I let Will pick.  And he picked scrufty.  He is huge now and getting more huge every day.  One day I think he will be taller than me.    Our catastrophe for the day is over, or at least sliding downhill fast, and that is a good thing.
