hey everyone,  well i've gone from the calm of koh chang to the chaos of st. joe.  the  school is moving into new facilites today.  why they didn't move everything  on our week off is beyond me!   now there are 7 year olds moving boxes which  i wouldn't carry up four flights of stairs.  anyway...  i'm glad i don't  have very many classes this morning.  other than that not much to tell.  i almost bought a computer that i would  have regretted purchasing yesterday.  very hi-tech and way too much money.   the internet really is wonderful sometimes.  i went to a site that warned me  against that model.  yeah me!  thank god the woman couldn't get my credit  card to work yesterday or i would have a crap computer.  well gotta run before sister erlinda catches me in the students only  computer room.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Is your PC infected?
