I'm a librarian, as you've probably guessed by my username.  We are in the throws of the Summer Reading Program during which each week various performers visit the library.  Some put on puppet shows, others do storytelling, and then there are the magicians.  Magicians are by far draw the biggest crowds.  Everyone is mesmerized by them - who isn't fascinated with magicians?!    Well, my husband has today off so decided to spend the day with our daughter and take her to the magic show later this afternoon (instead of having her go to the summer program preschool, like normal).  Last night he asked her if she wanted a daddy day... "No!" she said, "I want to go to school".   I was thinking to myself "cool, she finally likes going to school"... that isn't what my husband thought!   He knew it was silly, but he was hurt she'd rather go to school than spend the day with him.... she's almost 5, starting to grow up and show her independence - are we ready?!  This morning my husband thought he'd try one more time.  He asked her yet again if she'd like to have a daddy day and go see the magician later on.  She looks up at him and says "No I wanna go to school.  Hey!  I've got an idea!  You go and tape the show.  I'll watch the video tonight."  I had to chuckle... it is good though, I think.  She actually WANTS to go to school - I like that.  Knowing she can catch the show later on video is a bit disturbing, but part of the culture I suppose.   My husband at least sees the irony - he's trying to get her to not go to school for a day and she's saying no, that's where she wants to be.   If this is the least of our problems, we'll be lucky.
