Hey! Right now I'm back in school. Its Monday so I'm both tired and bored... Its been a long day so far, and it's only 3rd period! My weekend was interesting. I wasn't able so spend any time with my boyfriend because he was camping, but I still had fun. I can't relay all of my weekend, because I'm trying to keep this web-Blog as G-rated as possible. Anyways, I'm sorry that this is so short today, but I got to go. Bye!
