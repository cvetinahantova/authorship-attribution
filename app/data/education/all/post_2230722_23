If you haven't ever followed the Adam & Andy link here on my blog, do so today.  A&A is just the cutest little strip (not cute in that make me want to sacrifice Bil Kean's children to the devil kind of way) about a mid-thirties gay couple.  Now, James Asal the creator of A&A has posted the original run of strips on his website along with DVD-style commentary. And everyone I know knows that I just LOVE DVD-commentary.  Check it out  urlLink here  and then go read the modern stuff.
