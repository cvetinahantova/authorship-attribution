Okay, So lately I have been so annoyed online. I am actaully only annoyed at two people and about one subject.                  So, the other day i was online and there really wasn't to many people on. I was just kinda messing around with some settings and stuff. Then, all of a sudden this girl, Emma, from my school started talking to me. And we weren't really into a conversation, it was still the little stuff like "hey" and "whats up", when she asked me if i could do a favor for her. I really thought nothing of it and i was just like, "sure, i guess."   Then she said, okay will you sign onto my new screen name and send my buddy list to the screen name i'm on now. So i told her that i needed her password in order for me to sign on. Then, she signed off. I was talking to BB at the time and i was telling her how pissed i was getting and how mean it was for Emma to just talk to me to get a favor.   So, about like, a couple minutes later Emma signed back on. She never said Hi or anything she just told me her password. So im like, yea whatever, I'll just get this horse s*** done with. Then, when i got onto her sn it didnt work and i ended up having to do it twice more, and when i was done she didn't talk to me anymore.. and she still hasn't!      The other time was right after the Emma thing and it wasn't as bad.   So, a girl named Taylor started talking to me. We actually got into a real conversation before she asked me to send one of her other screen names an email. But the thinng that really bothered me about this 'favor', was that she could have sent the thing herself, because she obviously has the internet and an email address!   So, if you know me and we never really "talk" DONT EVER GET INTO A CONVERSATION WITH ME TO ASK ME A FAVOR!!
