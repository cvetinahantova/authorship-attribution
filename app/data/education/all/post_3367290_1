Its a Monday of course and I'm so bored I didn't go to school because I'm just so tired and I don't have the energy to go. But anyways on to a better subject, next weekend were (by means my whole family) going out to the lot (campground) well I wasn't going to go because I knew Jon wouldn't be able to go, or well thought. Well it came about that my mother asked my father if Jon could go with us and he actually said yes. The reason why I was so worried is because my dad is one of those people that is against older people dating younger people well so much younger I should say. Jon and I are eight years difference in age but that doesn't matter because I'm so mature for me being as young as I am. I had to grow up so fast I never got a childhood so I do feel as if I'm out of place if I hang out with other 16 years olds. For gods sake I had a child at the age of fifteen you cant really still tell me I'm a child. It hurts me that my dad is like that too because I love Jon so much I don't want to have to hide our relationship from him I want my father to know how happy I am and how good Jon is for me and my daughter. Also I have to hide that Jon and I have decided that he would like to take the role as being Justices father. That means so much to me because I know how hard it had to have been for him to do that knowing that she's not his biological child. Anyways I would love to tell my father that we've decided that he would be her father and I cant for another two years till I'm eight-teen. It scares me I'm afraid that Jon will get tired of hiding it and hell want out of this relationship.
