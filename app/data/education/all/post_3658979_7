Romance is not dead.  Many people say it is, but it's not.  My husband surprised me last weekend with a stay at a true bed and breakfast.  It was our two year anniversary.  He even had the host order a purple bouquet of flowers for me to be waiting there.  It was adorable.  The card said "Here's to two wonderful years with my greatest love and to the lifetime of memories we will share."  And the best part is....he came up with that all on his own.  Most people wouldn't believe that a man could come up with that.  Amazing, I know.   I haven't written in ages.  I just haven't had anything to write about.  Why write about the mundane every day activities I undergo at work?  You'd think I'd have a lot to write about since I work in a prison for juveniles.  But no one wants to read about my boring events.  But then I think about it.  No one reads my blog.  I'm being serious.  No one reads it.  So why should I care if I'm boring someone?  Right?  Because there is no one.   "I would swallow my pride; I would choke on the rinds, but the lack thereof would leave me empty inside."  Is it a  rine  of a fruit or a  rind  of a fruit?  Oh well.  Anywho.  I heard this song (I know, it's old) on the way home today and that lyric hit me.  It's genius.  He'd take care of his pride, swallow it, just to save face.  He'd even choke on his pride for this ex he's "through with."  Yet he's throwing it back in her face, saying he has no pride whatsoever.  He'd feel empty after eating it.   Why am I explaining these lyrics to you?  Like you're stupid or something.  Why am I even talking to you?  You don't exist.  No one is out there.  Is the truth out there?  I'm going insane.   Signing off now.  You can stop reading.  If you ever started.
