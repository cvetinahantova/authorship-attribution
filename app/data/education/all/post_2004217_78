The terrible person within me who never, ever blogs because she is a lazy git has returned. Hola. Now is the time for a list:  1. Easter/The Zoo 2. Barnsley 3. Work 4. Dad 5. Comics 6. Miscellaneous  We are now in our second day of school after the poor excuse for a holiday that was Easter. I had lots of  urlLink driving lessons  and can now do left turns and... well, that's about it. We went to  urlLink The Zoo  on  urlLink Easter Sunday , and it was soooo cute and there were sooooo many cutesy lil  cute animals! There was a baby  urlLink elephant  and  urlLink lions  and  urlLink tigers  and best of all...  urlLink MEERKATS!  I want a pet one. Don't laugh! They're so sweet, all fluffy and squiggly and... aww. :o)  Went to Barnsley on Easter Monday. Stayed with my nan. I haven't done that since I was about 7. Oliver came over and we all discussed... stuff. It felt like some sort of horrible secret summit, a nasty little bitching session. Very odd. Dad found out about the whole sorry affair on Monday, and he seemed strangely accommodating about the whole thing. What is wrong with all my family members? Hee hee.  Work, to be specific, revision, is looming ever faster towards me, being all scary and huge. I keep telling myself "It's OK, I have a whooole month before exams" and then I remember my German oral which is on the 6TH OF MAY (sob), and then my heart starts to beat faster and I feel sick. Blergh.  Dad is scaring me. He's going all out on the "you're my favourite daughter" routine. From New York, not only did he bring me the hat I requested, but some choccie lip balm, a note book, a Hard Rock Cafe pin and two tops! Mum reckons some of it was meant for Em... hehe. Apparently she was meant to come to Dad's house this weekend but he said something "wrong" on the phone the other day and she got all stroppy. Oh well, at least now I get the best bed for a bit longer....;o) I'm a bit apprehensive because this weekend I'm going to have to discuss  urlLink Uni  fees; we've been getting on so well since  urlLink Em  fucked off and I'd rather not jeopardise that by bringing up the ever painful subject of money. It always turns things sour.  What's next on the list? Ahhh, comics! Ed Blann has made me a compulsive webcomic reader; not only am I reading all of  urlLink his  comics, but 3 others:   urlLink Questionable Content , which is about some indie kids who may or may not fancy each other   urlLink Count Your Sheep , which is about a little girl called Katie and her imaginary friend Ship, who just so happens to be a sheep   urlLink Chugworth Academy , which I started reading today. It's about a group of naughty teenagers supposedly at high school in the good ole US of A, and their lives in general.  Help me. I think I have a comic problem. Looking back I also think I have a hyperlink problem. Still, I need the practice, right?  In other news, I have decided I am going to actually DO something with my hair. Mum got me some volumising shampoo for me today, and she's gonna trim it for me (finally!) and highlight it. She also suggested putting a broad pink stripe in it somewhere... hopefully it'll turn out alright... meep! I've also started listening to "North" again...it's such a smooth album and some of the tracks make me go all *mmm*. Ooh, and I randomly downloaded this thing from Microsoft which has made me a database of all my mp3s! Genius! If only it could do that with my CD collection... which reminds me, new  urlLink New Found Glory  album, Catalyst, in the shops, 17th May!! Bring it on! The new single, All Downhill From Here, is released the week after and I've already downloaded. Sweet as.    PLUG PLUG PLUG : Buy Rock Against Bush, show your support for a)  urlLink Fat Wreck , b)punk rock and c)MVC- it's only Â£4.99 if you buy it from there and it's got about 294958939394 tracks on it from some wicked bands.  Ceff x   Catalyst, you exist to pull me down...
