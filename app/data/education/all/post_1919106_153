If anyone tried to e-mail me within the last few days, there seems to have been sporadic downtimes on my mail forwarding service, so some of those e-mails may have been dropped. If you e-mailed me and got an  unknown recipient  response (or similar), then please re-send.  Now to the good end: I just love Gmail. It does an awesome job at managing long threaded discussions, and for all I care, the ads can stay. They've non-intrusive, and they're actually relevant. Having said that, I can invite 2 persons to try out the service. So if you are interested, drop me an e-mail, and I'll follow up with the invitation.
