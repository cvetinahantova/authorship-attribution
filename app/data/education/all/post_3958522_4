Well, our first meeting was Tuesday night, and all in all, I’d have to say it went swimmingly.    There were five people, plus Oreos and coffee.    The bulk of the time was spent discussing the shape we see the group taking and what we desire both from this church and from God.    We did arrive at a few basic conclusions:     Wendy      and I are leaders only in the loosest sense possible.    The members of this church own it, and will      take ownership as such.   The      church will grow no larger than about 10.         After that, a new church will be planted.   There      won’t be a planned lesson.    Everyone      is responsible for bringing something about their life and relationship      with God that they’d like to talk about.         That doesn’t mean that we’ll talk about everything everyone brings,      just that we’ll have plenty of fodder for a lively and productive      discussion.          That’s about it.    There was prayer and fellowship and discussion of cartoons afterward.    All in all, a lovely night, and one with which I sincerely hope God was pleased.
