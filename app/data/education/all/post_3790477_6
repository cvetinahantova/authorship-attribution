Wanna read something that will help you in the school of prayer?  Alexander Whyte (Scottish preacher 1836-1921) book is one of my favorites.  He's very honest, he reminds us that no one is fit to pray, it is a huge obstical.  But the man who get's into meditation and communication with God changes, from the hardest, meanest people to gentle and quiet.  What makes this different then any other work on prayer is the ephasis Whyte put's on imagination.  He'll give you many helps on focusing yourself, and will always be using his own word's to spark your heart on the eternal truths of the gospel.  Sometimes we need to put ourselve in the way of desperate pleadings to Love God, to know the way He first loved us, to think on Jesus, and have our hearts warmed to him.  Sometimes we need to hear clear portraites of heaven and hell before to spur us on, and bring us back form insanity and infatuation with the world, and the numbing and shrinking of our attention of the world.   urlLink On Amazon..
