Nothing deep or meaningful from me today, as I only got about five hours of sleep. Guh...  Why does every woman in corporate America have to bring a sweater to work? Why are all places of business like meat lockers by mid-afternoon? Is there some sweaty, obese guy in the basement cranking up the  air conditioning  so the rest of us have to suffer? Although that blast of cold air does help wake one up when you stagger in hung over. Maybe the sweaty guy is just trying to help us alcoholics out.  On another, almost-completely unrelated note,  ponchos  in summer are wrong .  I understand that some of us want to hide our pudgiferousness in this body-revealing season, but the hippie overtone of the poncho does not play when underneath you're rocking Corporate Casual.  Ponchos also look incredibly stupid with shorts and most skirts. Save the ponchos for Fall, will you? They might look nice over jeans or a short skirt and boots. (I'm not promising anything, though.  Ponchos are fairly annoying as a fashion statement - or lack thereof.)  The upshot is, I know it's freezing in your office, but leave the Jessica Simpson look at home.
