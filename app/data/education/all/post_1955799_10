Hmmmm.  I'm at work, and I'm still not fully awake.  Proud of the work I did yesterday for my novel.  I worked on charcters, so now I have a list of them, with their motives, and their relations to other characters.  Mind you. I also have the first ten pages typewritten, and at least five more handwritten.  I hope to produce some work later, when I go home.  Have to remember to make a back-up copy of my work on disk, so I have spare to work on.  Also need a print version of it, so I can edit directly on the text.
