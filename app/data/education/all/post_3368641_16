I have rode the wake of the ebb and flow of tides for some time now I feel I'm more relaxed treading the waters within and without me  I have been born into a weighted responsibility that hangs between humility and whatever created the universe I am learning to swim the blur of this metaphysical mile that it may touch both other lives and mine  what do I know of being a holy man I feel inadequate and unworthy to be on any pedestal  that is not of my making or understanding  but free will is the delusion  of the dreamer and my eyes are wide open I am obedient in this calling and in this fine line so that no shadows are cast If it were about me I would find it easier  to sleep  and if it were about me I'd never of allowed the tide to take me the symbology has not  eluded me that the ocean is measured in 'fathoms' because swimming a metaphysical mile offshore feels like 6 feet under understanding  Â©2003 DC Vision
