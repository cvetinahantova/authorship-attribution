Today, after a session of Interesting DISC assembly, and a Long Tiring day in school, i had a Fun game of bball which caused the Painful injury of my thumb...   DISC... for those who dunno my personality and wanna know it, i am a S/C... in the first 3 mths was C/S... but almost the same lor.. CS or SC... just a little difference in priority.. In fact, i decided this change.. sound unreal.. but it is so..   I used to be one who would always be there to prove that i am right, making many conflicts and stuff like that... i realized that such arguments are redundant.. so i made the decision to give in more often.. which probably lead to this change..  Then the long day nothing much lor..   Now, the game!! hehe.. I think i have improved.. dunno how dunno why... but today was like WooHoo!!! haha.. but that's what i think only.. dunno what others think.. Overall, i had a great game lor.. =P though we lost, i still happy =) er.. anyway, paiseh wor.. if i did not fooled ard at the end.. we would surely have won.. sorry ar :s  hmm.. Painful thumb.. thx to _______ lor.. use ball hit until my thumb.. inner bleeding.. pain sian.. now thumb cannot press stuff normally.. sianz...  Then end of day, go home, i read comic read until like in the comic like that... i missed my stop.. had to get off, cross the platform, take train back.. sianz.. but funny..   ha...
