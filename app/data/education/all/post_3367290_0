Its a wonder why people act the way they do. I dont understand where they figure they have the right. Okay where im going with this is, last night my father throw a huge fit on me about me not going to school. It wouldnt have been so bad if he hadnt threatend to take my child away from me, i mean come on, just for the fact that im not going to school every single day! I mena i get my hourse in like im suppossed to ( uselly) its not like i absoultly do not go i do. I just hate going there couse im not a crackhead and im not stupid witch is what my schools for im just a teen parent. I figure though this summer i WILL get a job and will move either movewith my special someone or back to portland but i will not stand by and listen to my parents threaten to take my child way. Oh by the way another thing they said was they thought i didnt love my daughter, now who in there right mind could tell me i dont love my child ( i will say again my child) dont you think if ididnt love her i would have choose to give her up when my mother gave me the chance. Even when i was pregnant i had the chance to give her up ( the morning after pill) and i wouldnt it was my choice to keep her and i wouldnt have kept her if i didnt want her and its not like i kept her to just have a baby. By the way the person who suggested that i give my baby up and who suppiled the morning after pill was my mother so i dont think she has any room to talk. Well thats my drama for yesterday hope you enjoy it more than i did. Be back another day!
