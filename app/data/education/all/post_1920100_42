Finally Friday! I am so glad it is Friday.   This week was a bit stressful. 8 more days and school is out. I am excited. It is going to be weird though being out of the classroom in the summer. I will still work with kids though (which I love) at the art camp.  This weekend looks like it's going to be nice . I really feel like going to the beach. Hopefully I will make some time to do that.  Tomorrow  I am going to some women's conference in Carson. Its the series of conferences I have been attending for a while now. They have them every 3 months and each time it is a big blessing. I really enjoy them. There is good teaching, fellowship and worship.  On Sunday , the usual...church and care group.  I will keep you updated to let you know how the conference was and how the weekend ends up.
