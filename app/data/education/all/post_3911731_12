this is obviously my first day writing in here, since this is entry numero uno. Ummm...anyways, today was a nice/good/fun day. I woke up and janelle called and told me to come over. So i got ready and all that crap and went to her house. Her mom made some really good homemade chicken corn soup. Her mom is the best cook ever and she always makes big meals on the weekends. After lunch we swam for a couple hours. Swimming is fun except when janelle gets out and tans and im left alone :-( Her sisters are usually there with us though so i can swim with them then. After we were done swimming we went and got some fishing rods and lures together and we got our bikes and road to conodoguinet creek. Her house is semi-close to Armitage golf course and theres a bike path near there that leads to the creek, so we went that way. We only fished for about a half hour because she doesn't really have the patience to fish, but she really likes to do it, for the couple of minutes that we do each time we go. I was getting real close to the edge of the water and i didnt reall notice that it was all muddy and i had my old shoes on from 8th grade that have no grip left and i slipped and fell in the creek. I Didn't really fall the whole way in, just my legs went in, but it was pretty deep for being right on the edge. my shoes were filled with mud and my hands were all muddy, so janelle just told me to go out in the middle of the creek and fish, i agreed but for some reason i didnt go out right away, i got out of the water and walked around for some reason and i was getting ready to get back in slowly so i could go out in the middle, and then i fell in again. Well this time i got big chunks of mud in the bracelets that janelle made for me so i got out of the water again so i could lean my hands in the water (instead of easily placing them in the water while i was standing in it), and when i leaned in the wash my hands off, you guessed it, i fell in again. Somehow all three times i fell in, i only got my legs wet and not my shirt. Luckily i was wearing my swim shorts, so it didnt really matter. After the third time, i just grabbed my rod and told janelle i'll be back. I fished in the middle of the creek for like 5 minutes because janelle wanted to leave right when i got out there. So we pakced up and rode back to her house. We got back and swam some more then her grandma took me and janelle and her two sisters to brewsters for ice cream. It was good, but i couldnt eat all mine so i threw the end of it out. We came home and me and janelle and her sister melanie (her oldest sister, shes 12) watched a movie downstairs, its called "MadMan" its one of three horror movies i bought at suncoast two weeks ago. I buy a scary movie like every weekend at suncoast because i love them, but i bought three on a "triple points" weekend there. I belong to the replay points club and each penny u spend there, u get one point, for every 10,000 points u get a $5 gift certificate, and on the triple points weekend, my total points from my purchase gets tripled so i got a shitload of points. I spent 45 bucks. I have 25 dollars in certificates so far. After we got done watching the movie it was like quarter till ten so her mom took me home. Now im here typing this and stuff. Thats it for today, come back tomorrow night for my daily update.       urlLink     urlLink  Click Here         [  urlLink View Guestbook  ] [  urlLink Sign Guestbook  ]  urlLink  Get a FREE guestbook here!
