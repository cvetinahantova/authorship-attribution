urlLink Impact of Two-Way Immersion on Students' Attitudes toward School and College. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Lindholm-Leary, Kathryn J. and Borsato, Graciela.  From the ERIC Digest:  One program model that has shown positive outcomes for Hispanic students is two-way immersion (Lindholm-Leary, 2001), also known as two-way bilingual or dual language education. Two-way programs integrate native English speakers and English language learners in the same classroom and provide content instruction in both English and the native language of the English language learners. These programs aim to provide high quality educational experiences for all students and promote higher levels of academic achievement.  This digest reports on a study that examined the impact of participation in a two-way immersion program on the language and achievement outcomes of former program participants and on their current schooling path and college plans. The study explored outcomes for three groups of students: 1) Hispanic students who began the two-way program as English language learners; 2) Hispanic students who began the program as English-only or English-dominant speakers; and 3) European American students who entered the program as monolingual speakers of English.
