Have you ever thought about why things turn for the worst at the worst ttime? Everyday that thought crosses my mind. Yet..it all seems like another bump in the road to me. Nothing is ever the same arounnd me sometimes. like at school it seems surreal to me. Like it couold all fade away like a drream. Disapear in the light of the sun.  i donno I am having one of those days ya' know. Insain huh? lol.
