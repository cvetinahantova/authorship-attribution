I find this  urlLink blog  randomly last night... Made me cry. ;)   I concur  As  urlLink Paul notes , we had a difficult meeting at church Sunday night. I was there partly because some friends talked us into seeing Shrek 2 with them, so we never made it home to Mebane in the afternoon, but also because I wanted to be there with Paul, since it involved him to some extent, and I was afraid it was going to get ugly. In my past experience, usually when something threatens to get ugly, even within a church congregation, it does. I was very pleasantly surprised. No one cast harsh or undue blame, and no one used the occasion to build him/herself up or to tear others down. I have to give a lot of credit to our pastors for setting the right tone and saying the right things, but also to the congregation (at least those who were present) for respecting the pastors enough to listen to them and recognize that they spoke the truth. I told Paul how surprised I was at the amicability of the whole evening and he said "That's why I love this church." And as much as I miss some of the liturgy and traditions of the Lutheran church, I've never seen a Lutheran congregation so serious about treating their brothers and sisters as God requires.
