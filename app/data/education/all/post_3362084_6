I have to put this post up about this really bizarre dream I had last night.  First of all I was in front of a slot machine with some other people and we all put money in and got three "7" in a row.  I think "Yay, we won," the number "370" flashes on the screen so I take the ticket to redeem it for money.  Well instead they give each of us a nice shiny handgun.  Me I am thinking "What the hell, I've never even held a real gun let alone use it!"  So than I go into this cafeteria like area to go eat with some friends when all of a sudden my former housemate (Chhimi) storms in.  Apparently in this dream he is a police officer/FBI that type of person and he proceeds to arrest me for having things on my computer I didn't pay for (updated windows programs and all the "shared" music).  I freak out and hand over my gun I won from the slot machine and he takes me away, but not in cuffs.    BOOM I wake up confused as hell.
