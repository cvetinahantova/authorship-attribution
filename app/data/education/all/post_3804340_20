It is the reunion day of HKSAR. To me, it's just an extra holiday. This extra holiday is a headache day for the government as there was a demonstration. The organization body claimed more than 510,000 went demostration under the hot sun.   As my father usually says, politics is a dirty game. The further you stay away the better.
