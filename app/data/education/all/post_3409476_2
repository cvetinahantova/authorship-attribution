I just got a call from Adam, they've arrived in Cleveland safe and sound.  They are attending ( feasting  is how he put it) a reception for all atheletes before they go to their dorms.  Kathy sent her digital camera with him, so sometime between now and Tuesday when he gets home, Erika or Gretchen will have to teach me how to post pictures.  If you want to keep track of the games, I think they will be posting scores and info on the website  urlLink http://www.childrens-games.org/   (Erika it made it a link automatically on the PC)
