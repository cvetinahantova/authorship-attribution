It starts like this, I suppose.  A blank page waiting to be filled with mild musings, wild flights of fancy, and everything in between.  I have a website, http://www.greyhawkmanor.org, but by the time I get around to updating anything I have forgotten HTML and must relearn everything from scratch.  At one point I kept an online portfolio at Writing.com, but endless hassles with the parnoid hacker who runs the joint resulted in two portfolios being deleted, the first by me, the second by him.  It wouldn't be so bad except in the end the loss of both portfolios resulted in his confiscating over $400 of my hard-earned cash.  Criminal complaints have so far gone unnoticed.  I guess the FBI is too busy looking for Osama BinLaden.  I don't know if this blog (goodness me, is that an appropriate acronym or what?) will ever amount to anything, but I'll run with it for a little while and see how it goes.  Cheers to anyone who wastes a minute reading this!
