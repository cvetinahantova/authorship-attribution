man, even if telemarketing stinks, i have the funniest boss ever :-)  2 stories from today: today, her 5 year old joshua mostly hung out downstairs playing with his matchbox cars and watching cartoons, but he came upstairs to the office at one point and said his nose hurt.  carolyn (my boss) didn't see anything wrong, but to make him "feel better", she put a bandaid on it... she didn't feel like going downstairs and all she had upstairs was a huge butterfly bandaid that covered his whole nose!  everytime he came back up to say hi and went away we laughed for 10-15 minutes about how funny he looked with a bandaid he didn't really need on his face :-P  heh :-P  story 2... halfway through the afternoon, carolyn all the sudden jumped up and said "hey let's watch the garbage men out the window"... explaining... there was a big thunderstorm last week that threw their pool furniture all over the place... apparently something hit their neighbor's cat because after the storm, they found him dead under their swimming pool... they put him in a garbage bag in the trash (this part is sad, i agree) and he'd been there for 4 days in the 90+ degree heat and humidity, so it stank pretty bad out front... she wanted to watch their faces as they dealt with throwing the trash into the garbage truck... that got us laughing for another 20 minutes -- dude!  so yeah, i have a humorous boss ;-)  more data entry fun tonight after checking email and prolly going to starbucks with mom for a bit :-P... then again every night but one since i've been back in town, travis has called me to talk for awhile, so it's really more a factor of how much i get done before he calls rather than how much i get done before i crash ;-)  later dudes :-P
