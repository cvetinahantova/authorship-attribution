Welcome Friends and Onlookers,  After months about hearing about these "BLOG" journals, I have finally decided to give into peer pressure and begin my own, documenting the weird, the interesting, the delusional, and seemingly surreal, parts of my life.  I hope it is an interesting journey for you as it is for me.  I am a 26 year old college student living at home with his parents but pretending not to.  I somehow managed to drag out what should have been a 2-year diploma into an 8-year adventure.  It's a long story that I hope to share with you sometime.  My only crowning achievement during that time is that I found a job as an overpaid instructional assistant for the college's ESL department.  It's a great place to work that challenges my creativity (as long as you don't let the internal politics get you down).  Plus, you get to meet some interesting people.  As for the romance area, it's been rocky at best.  I will even go so far as saying that my relationships have the same effect as kryptonite on Superman.  I have recently broken up with my girlfriend; mostly because I am hopelessly in love with a coworker who is totally unavailable.  I welcome your feedback, comments, wisdom, and your plain old criticism.  If I can accomplish anything with this blog other than chronicling my daily mishaps, it would be to give you a sense that your life isn't as complicated and screwed up as you think it is.  Hell, have a laugh at my expense if you can.  ^_^  Cheers,  Faceless Butcher
