Last night I dreamed we were at the beach.  All of us,me, Tommy, the boys, Renee, Stan and Savannah and EJ, my sis, and I don't know how many others were there.  All of us women were  sitting in our beach chairs, enjoying the sun and mist off the water, and the kids were all playing in the sand, building sand castles and pretending they were the kings and queens of beach Rogers. Then men were skeet shooting over the water.   All of the sudden, Savannah starts talking just as plain as a 3.5 year old can.  Talking about a chocolate fudge ice cream sundae.  She wanted one, and was going to eat it all gone.    I woke up with a smile on my face.    Right now, Savannah is very speech delayed, she talks and is getting better, but is still very hard to understand.  She also can't eat a chocolate fudge ice cream sundae.  Her liver transplant would make my dream possible.  Now I know what food I want to be the first to give her.  A chocolate fudge ice cream sundae.  Maybe we will make it a weekly tradition, just me and her, off to the ice cream shop for our girls time.    She just needs to wake up first.
