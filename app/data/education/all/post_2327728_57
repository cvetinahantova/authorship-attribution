The content of this entry was too infamitory, and might be construed as malicious - which it was not. But after re-reading it, I thought better of publishing the whole thing, and decided to simply publish the following thesis statement at the core of the entry:  I am sooo right all the time.  Seriously.  NOW... I just wish I wasn't so cynical; otherwise, I might have a really great life.  Also,  urlLink Jonny Rocket , your picture is gorgeous (who is your photographer??! Lovely), and I have just added a link to your blog (on the side, too). Everyone should go read it, and leave a comment (or just send out good vibes to make sure he gets his trip).  Ciao darlinks.  And it wouldn't kill you to leave a comment here, too.
