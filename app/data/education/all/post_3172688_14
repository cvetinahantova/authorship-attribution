Hi! Ugh, right now I'm in computer applications and we are doing these Tab-Tables that are really stupid because they're hard to do and you can do the same thing with a regular table in word! Itâ€™s all right, I'm finished with the assignment now...I think I finally got the hang of them :D.  Anyways I think there is only like 20 days left of school... I'm so happy! Anyways Today I ate: 1 doughnut 1 Cup Of Noodles
