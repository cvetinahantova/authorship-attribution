Part one of my adventures  I've always like traveling.  Whether it was riding in the station wagon to the grocery store or a spring break trip to Florida.  I loved being on the go.  It was the otherness of it all.  Knowing that I was not at home.  How did the Europe trip begin?  It began in my mind.  The Legend of Backpacking in Europe.  It's up there with Working on a Fishing Boat in Alaska.  It is the ultimate lure for an idealistic young man on the verge of having to face reality.  I decided that after I graduated, I was going to Europe.  Alone, if none of my friends wanted to join me.  But I was going.  The actual formation of the trip began in Billy's massive bedroom.  His room was so big that you could fit the 12 Days of Christmas in there with room to spare for an extra partridge. But this time is was just me, Billy, Dan, and Jesse.    After a few beers I told them of my Europe plans and next thing I know there is a map sprawled on the carpet and we were picking out cities to visit.  That's how The Legend is.  One word of it and it speads like wildfire.  Eventually, Dan and Jesse dropped out (It was not  unexpected from Jesse, who also elected not to attend Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, but that's another story altogether).  It was Billy and I.  A modern-day Lewis and Clark off to explore the undiscovered European continent.  Hopefully, we thought, it is big enough to contain us.  But first, we had to negotiate the wilderness of McMaster-Carr
