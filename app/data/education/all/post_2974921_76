this week had been so hectic!!!!  for the past days, i haven't been able to eat lunch at the right time because i had to stay in the library to do my research for our religion project which seems to be some kind of mini-thesis. i remember last wednesday, i had to eat my lunch under 3 minutes before the bell rang. then last thursday, i ate lunch after school. it was ok since i eat in class. i bring 2 sandwiches to school because i eat one during recess and the other during AP, ms. san andres doesn't see me anyway. i don't have a problem with my time of meal, i'm just surprised by how busy i am...and by how i'm coping with it. lately, i've been feeling kinda responsible. i actually did a "to do" list for the weekend! maybe it's because i found out how hard it is to be a senior because requirements flood their lives. i don't wanna die so i might as well practice now that i'm still a freshman.  i'm a member of the art committee in school and we had a project last week. we had to make posters for the campaign of the soda can drive. i participated a lot in that! i came up with 2 slogans, i brought materials and i attended almost every meeting! i guess i felt bound to that. i kinda miss being included in something like the magazine. i swear next year i'll be a staffer! anyway, i noticed that most of the active members of the artcom were freshmen. it was ok, though i'm not so satisfied by our products. it wasn't that good and i bet the student body wasn't that happy.  I met ate lia in that committee. She’s this pretty senior who was really kind to us. I like her because she’s responsible.  Yesterday was fun! We had a jamming session in the morning. 5 of us brought our guitars and it was fun! I guess guitar-playing is the new trend these times.
