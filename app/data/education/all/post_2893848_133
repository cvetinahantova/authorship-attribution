Desperately Seeking a Telephone Booth   I've caught wind of the murmerings:  you people think Scott is my  urlLink alter   urlLink ego .  Did you people honestly think this?  Really.  If I was going to have an alter ego, would it be a librarian obsessed with apes and viola players?     And I know what you wiley conspiracy theorists are thinking: that I, Pete, am in fact an alter ego to Scott.  But that makes no more sense than the opposite.  Would Scott do all the research of feigning an obsession with the red sox?  Of pretending, generally, to be a oversized Italian trapped in Iowa?  To what end?  Wouldn't it be a lot simpler for me, who exists, to have just asked my friend Scott, who also exists, if he wants to post on my blog?  Ockham's Razor, people.   urlLink Ockham's Razor .  But I realize that my reasoning will not appeal to the suspicious.  You want proof.  Cyber-proof.  It's just that I'm not sure what cyber-proof would be.  I could post a picture of us, but you will just say: hey, a picture of two guys doesn't prove anything.  I could have third parties write in support of both our existences, but you will just say: hey, they're no more legit than Rick Moody.  (No, I didn't impersonate Rick Moody, but someone else easily could have.)    What would do it?  We're not about to scan in our driver's licenses, and anyway, you people would just say:  photoshop.  So what will quell the suspicions?
