Last night was so bizzarre.  It started as Lauren and I were discussing how extremely hot it was in the ASD dorms.  I was really thirsty because I was so hot.  Due to the fact that I didnt want to change out of my pajamas, we figured it would be smart to go to McDonald's drive through and buy some drinks.  We arrive at McDonald's and I start ordering for Lauren.  My mind was in a blur (surprise surprise!) so I started reading the board...a new item...but, I ended up ordering things I didnt want because I read it outloud.  So I ordered these apple slices in a bag.  From McDonalds?  Eww!  On the way back we saw this VW Bug.  It was white and Black and in big bold letters on the side it said "Geek Squad."  Lauren and I laughed so hard.  Lauren tried to look at the driver, but he noticed we were trying to see who would drive such a car, and used his arm to block his face.  When we got back we did some research.  http://www.geeksquad.com  The Geek Squad is a computer company and every "agent" has his own number (I think we met Agent 36 last night), identical cars, and identical black rectangle rim glasses.  Wow, it is really funny.  I want to have a squad.  I can be agent P.  So, we get back to ASD, laughing hard.  I realized that I left my wallet in the car so I went to grab it.  As Lauren closed the door, my drink went crashing down to the floor.  We spent 1/2 hour getting a drink, and I didnt have 1 sip!!!  Sad News!  So, we got back into the car and went to the local gas station.  What a bizzare night!!
