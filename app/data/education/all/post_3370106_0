I wonder what it takes to remove all the fear from my heart?  What does it take to let go entirely into the loving arms of the almighty?  What does it take to give oneself completely to the divine spark that permeates everything?  I can't answer any of these.  I only know that I must find the will, the means, and the honest reflection that should accompany the attempt at finding an answer.  Never mind what has passed before!  Nothing from the past can put a stop to the momentum that has started building already.  I am no longer stuck in a spiralling whirlpool of destruction, but I must remain constantly aware of the dangers from delusion.  I pray that today I will live fully in the moment unified in my movements with all that surrounds me, open to possibility, fully awake, and fully aware of the life I am living.
