hello,  well i'm doing great.  today's lesson at school went very well. i played 20  questions with them and worked on how to properly ask questions.  it went  great and the girls loved it.  it feels great when i actually get to teach  them something and they enjoy it.  other than that i don't have much to say.  i also had a great dinner with nancy and cammie at a local thai restaurant.  also, my cold is much better.  yeah.  well gotta run.  i'll write more later.  love ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!
