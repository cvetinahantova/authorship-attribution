I hate to have to break the news to you, Pete, but Troy was a stinker.  Bad dialogue, confusing action, all moneyshots and silly close-ups.  Like a porno without the penises.  I was bored.  Most suspiciously current exchange: Nestor:  If we leave now we'll lose all credibility in the region. Odysseus:  But if we stay and fight, we should do so for the right reasons. (I'm paraphrasing.  I might have added "in the region," but "credibility" was definitely in there.)  Big Bad Brad's best line:  "Everything is more beautiful because we are doomed."
