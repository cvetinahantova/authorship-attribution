Financing Available   Need an  urlLink imaginary girlfriend ? (Via  urlLink Memepool )  I can't decide whose psychology is more interesting to me here:  the guy who buys the service or the girl who provides it.  I imagine that the site does something to protect these girls from clients who have trouble differentiating fiction and fact, or I hope so, at least.  I think I need to write a short story about this.
