Event of the day: Erotic fiction! The "Better Than Cosmo" area of the Wonderbook (notice proper nounage) somehow  morphed  into page upon page of erotic fiction, plus a rather random "What turns you on?" list that Lucy plans to turn into a story. Hee Hee! Much fun was experienced by all during our frees this morning as Liz and I created some naughty stories for our own sordid amusement/pleasure. Mwahahaha.  Event of the day before: Yesterday saw the final, much welcomed episode of the Ceff-Draper saga, when Coz rang him and asked him if he fancied me. Much **FEAR** occurred and I had to Calm myself by listening to the following songs while I waited for the outcome:  Hell Is For Heroes- I Can Climb Mountains Good Charlotte- Waldorfworldwide Something Corporate- I Woke Up In A Car  After YEARS of ":::calm:::**FEAR**:::calm:::*FEAR*" the message came back...  He doesn't fancy me.  I expected it really, and I seem surprisingly un-bothered. He likes someone he works with. I could be seething; green with envy at this WITCH that is stealing my Drapes from me- but I'm not. I suppose it would be more interesting that way, but I've never been one to be predictable. At least, I hope not!  Ceff x   By the way, your hands were shaking...
