I spent 2 hours looking for something to write in here that would actually be interesting.  Here's my go at it:  A recent article was taken from a Vietnam News Paper that discussed 9/11.  The main point was about if we deserved it or not.  Apparently, 76% of the people questioned answered YES.  They said several years ago they would have gladly came here to live, but after 9/11, they said that they saw how awful our country was and were halfway happy that we were attacked.  "It put them back into prospective" said one guy.  I just thought that with everything going on that this would be something we could talk about.  Personally, I think Vietnam can go stick their heads back in their own tree hole and leave us alone.  Do  you  think that we deserved to be attacked?
