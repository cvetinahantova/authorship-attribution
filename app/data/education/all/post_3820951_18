can a guy and a girl really jut be friends? without one of them falling for the other?   i found out something about myself today…actually i’ve been this for so long a time already but it’s only now that i have the term for it. thanks to my philosophically-gifted buddy who gave it to me… i am a sapiophile! look it up people…=)
