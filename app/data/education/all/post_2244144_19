urlLink Heather La Bella, the LA Spark's tactical marketing director, is going to pose nude for Playboy . Apparently it is her belief that this will increase the teams's and, to some extent, the sport's popularity.  Her way to attract the potential fans is to hold a WNBA basketball while she is being photographed naked. Now the reasoning with her logic is idiotic because...   She is not even a player in the league. It would be one thing to actually have a player pose for a photoshoot to get popularity, but this person is the TACTICAL MARKETING DIRECTOR. What is the likelihood people will ever see her at a game? If there is a number equivalent to that answer, it would look a something like 0.    Her way of advertising the WNBA to the Playboy audience is to expose a WNBA ball in the photos. Now as a man I am very sure that my male cohorts will be staring at some other round objects if they are looking Playboy.  Secondly, the problem with only the WNBA ball is it will provide no incentive to actually like the WNBA. Take for example last year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue where [insert anorexic model here] posed provocatively with sheep. Let me ask you a question. Did you want to go out and buy some sheep after looking at that? Of course not. You wanted to look at some more naked women. That is all this Playboy ploy is going to amount to. It will have no actual value to the Sparks or the league.   Of course with the way the league is going right now, maybe Heather needed a little extra cash and this was her excuse so people would not ridicule her.
