Happy 4th of July everyone.  We are going tonight to our town's celebration.  They have a street party on main street, then at 10pm  set off fireworks.    The town officials decided to do the fireworks tonight instead of actually on teh 4th out of respect for the local churches.    Did everybosdy get scared off?  NO one has left any comments lately.  If feel left out!lol.    Have a great weekend.
