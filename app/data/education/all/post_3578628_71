This has been an ongoing thing for a while, but now it's reached a new high.  Now I'm aware of the fact that lawyers aren't really held in too high esteem with the public, but what's going on now is blatant discrimination.  Doctors in certain areas across the country are refusing service to lawyers AND their families due to an increase in malpractice suits.  WHAT?!  Lawyers are supposed to be held to some moral and ethical standard right?  Aren't doctors supposed to be held to that same standard?  They both have a duty to do their job. It's the JOB of a lawyer to take cases.  Whether it's prosecuting or defending, they are doing their JOB.  By refusing service to lawyers and their families they are effectively doing the exact opposite of what their job is supposed to be.  You know, I wanna be a lawyer.  I wanna help people.  That's what doctors are supposed to do too, but they won't because of malpractice suits.  Well, if doctors didn't commit malpractice, then this wouldn't happen.  Oh, did I mention the reason that doctors are so upset about malpractice suits?  It's not because they're worried about hurting people, it's not because of their repuation being ruined.  These "moral" and "ethical" doctors are complaining about increased insurance premiums as a result of these suits. Yes, the same doctors that are refusing service to lawyers are complaining because they have to pay more for not doing their own job right.  I refer you to the title of my post.
