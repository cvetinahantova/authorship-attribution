When i'm alone...i always think back...Think about the happy & sad things happen in the past...Many happy things happen in my life that i will never forget...For Example Celebrating Mark's [Lao Tai GOng]Birthday the way we torture him, Kana suan by my shsb family member or when toking crappy things...haha really got alot of fun...Then about sad things I will think about how my friend make my bf n i break up, SOme women trying to steal the guy i like away, or some idiotic people make life diffcult for either one of my shsb family member...I tell u i will make sure the idiotic pple life even worst then wat they giv to my friends...But after thinking all that... i feel that in life pple have to be happy & sad... But when u think about sad things better dun think of going commit suicide or watever thing that r stupid... After doing that i tell u regret also no use le... u r going to die... SO moral of the story is ask u dun do stupid things..
