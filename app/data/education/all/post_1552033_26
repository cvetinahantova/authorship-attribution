Tokyo today is hot, sunny, and mildly humid.  A brilliant summer day.  If more days were like this I would have grown to love summer here a long time ago.  Sadly, today is the exception.  The majority of days are either grey, overcast, broiler hot and unbearably humid, or cold, miserable, and rainy.  In all my many travels, Tokyo has the most unusual summer weather I have ever seen.
