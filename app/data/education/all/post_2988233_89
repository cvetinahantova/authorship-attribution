Seema as if our streak of bad luck has now reached the dog.  Poor thing, his face is all swollen up like he got into something he is allergic too.  He can barely see.  I fell so sorry for him.  I bet he wishes he had different owners.lol  American Idol- what can I say, Jennifer, Fantasia, and LaTonya are amazing.  Those women are in a three way tie for first I do believe.  They all know how to feel the songs they are singing, and make you believe it.  I am getting tired of George Huff.  Just the look on his face all the time.  He jsut looks goofy.  And as much as I hate to say it because I love his voice, I think red head John needs to go.  I love his voice, but he isn't the American Idol.    The apprentice comes on tonight.  Whohooooo.    My teeth/jaw are feeling better today.  I have been resting it like they told me to.  And taking my tylenol every 4hours like they said.  Just untl the pain stops.  Casey is doing good with his arm.  Really good, he has full movement now.  So maybe the Orthopod was right? (go figure) lol.    My m.o.m. degree doesnt' cover broken bones and reading xrays.  Just changin diapers and wiping noses.
