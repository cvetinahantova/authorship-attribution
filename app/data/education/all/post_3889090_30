Just saw this amazing movie  It's 3:00 am and I shouldn't be here. It's just that I feel so alive, my brain is so awake. I feel like a frustrated creative type - I've got spans of pent-up mental energy and I don't know what to do with it. I feel like I could solve the worlds problems right here, right now, but I know from past experience that my thinking isn't great at this time of the night. It's very frustrating. There's something in me just bursting to get out, but it never comes out.  I guess I'll just have to go to bed. How mundane and anticlimactic. The real world is so boring sometimes.  bye.
