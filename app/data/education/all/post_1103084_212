. a near miss conversion on drop ceilings .  grading is done -- all turned in.   i'm still 200 emails behind.  weather is finally beautiful consistently.  office is such a disaster that i (literally) can't open the door to get in.  jaelyn has strep throat (again!).  graduation was filled with happy / odd endings with many student/friends.  i'm writing a play about superheroes and lumberjacks.  Sort of.  Lynn and I are both teaching Summer One Session -- so til June 10 or something like that.  its only one class each which seems much more manageable.    finished the kitchen floor, too, for those of you who have a better ability to keep up on such details...its much more squishy beneath our feet.    i've been a strict opponent against linoleum for as long as i can remember -- along with wood paneling, drop ceilings, and formica countertops.  now that i know how cushy this rolled vinyl is -- i'm thinking that i should give up all my elitist preconceptions regarding natural vs. synthetic surfaces -- tammie challenged me yesterday on my non-formica stance anyway -- she said as someone who has a moniker of retrorudd *really* should give formica the time of day.  so maybe i should embrace the simulacra...enter more fully the swirl of popcult...  it really is the drop ceilings that is holding me back.  They just feel like a crime against hope.  always squishing us down -- making us feel like we should live in low slung spaces....
