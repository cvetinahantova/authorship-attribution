OK...I'm sure that you have all scrolled down through this EXTENSIVE list...but have everyone taken the time to actually read some of this stuff?  For the newcomers, like Barbie and Ambur, I ask that you go through all of the blogs, at least pick out the one's that interest you, and   LEAVE COMMENTS  . The whole point of this is to hear each other's views on different topics...so if you don't leave comments...then it will fail, or at least post a new post about something.  I'm not being crabby...at least i'm not trying to be, I'm just stating that if you don't leave comments, even on topics you're not sure about but have feelings for, then none of us will have anything else to build off.  Thanks for listening to little ol me!
