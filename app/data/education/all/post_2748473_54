Wow, my life is extremely mixed up. I am realizing how poor of an example I am in being a child of God and it eats me up how inadequate I am and where and how I wanna be and I wonder if I can be the person I wanna be. All these people that I am close to are leaving me in miles or in hearts so I am in a scary situation wondering what is gonna happen. I am not scared but just kind of just wanna let whatever is gonna happen happen and not really care but hey, whatever. I notice I am starting to fall for this girl I am really awesome friends with but I am so screwed up over losing a friend in my whole day to day issues and they deal with my crap everyday, but I dunno. Girls are confusing me to death right now and there are a million on my mind and two that matter to me. I am ready for summer for real though. I wanna just get lost somewhere and just go skate and go work. That would rock so freaking hard.     Sing like no one is listening
