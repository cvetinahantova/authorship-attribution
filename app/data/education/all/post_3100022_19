Pie floaters in pea soup is pretty much how one would describe London at first glance, on decent to Heathrow we passed through not less than five layers of cloud, quite surprising considering the fact that as I write this the sun is beaming happily through the slider doors of our generous hosts living room. So the two current most notable things about London are fog so thick you can slice it with Boeing, and size; London is big... no bigger than big its really really big, noticeably twice as big as any of the cities we flew over while travelling to this illustrious destination. You can't see the ends of the city lights, it's almost overwhelming. Especially when you see the mix of industrial areas and suburban slums intermixed like the strands of a flax basket.
