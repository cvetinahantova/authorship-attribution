Book   That dusty, old book  The kind of the look It gives me a spook A rare bewitchment It says it will cook A raw mystery I took The risk, and it shook I - a new wonderment It calms me like a brook It gives me a good hook For sure, am not a crook To voice my amazement A friendship with rook  Of literature, my nook That dusty, old book   ~Kekua May 2004
