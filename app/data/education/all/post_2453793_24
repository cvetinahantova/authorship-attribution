i am mad but i don't exactly know why.  i am sad but the reason remains hidden...from mine and everyone else's eyes.  i am jealous and i know exactly why.  even though it's not my place to feel that anymore...it's so hard to let go sometimes...even as just a friend.  you should know that i simply wanted to know how you think, who you are, what you believe, what you feel, what drives you, and most of all, i wanted to understand...i wish so much that i could make you see.  i want you to understand too.  i want you to know me.  why couldn't you let me in?  why couldn't i let you in?  i need answers, but the questions are ones that supposedly only i can answer.  it seems like such an easy question, "what did i do wrong?" but the answers never rise to the surface.  everyone is so damn afraid to hurt me that they keep me from the truth.  my universe is filled with lies...lies that others have told me...lies that i've told others...lies that i believe.  i don't even know who to trust anymore.  and here i'm left...alone...without any answers.  just this desire to change myself.  i'm not sure who i have become, and i'm not sure who i will become.  all i know is that i will never be the same.
