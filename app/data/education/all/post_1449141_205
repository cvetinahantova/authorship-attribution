This is Your Story - The Progressive Story of America. Pass It On.    http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0610-11.htm   by Bill Moyers        Text of speech to the 'Take Back America' Conference    June 4, 2003    Washington, DC      ï¿½     Thank you for this award and for this occasion. I don't deserve either, but as George Burns said, I have arthritis and I don't deserve that, either.   Tomorrow is my 69th birthday and I cannot imagine a better present than this award or a better party than your company.      Also See:  Bill Moyers' "Presidential" Address  John Nichols/The Nation 6/9/2003       Fifty three years ago tomorrow, on my 16th birthday, I went to work for the daily newspaper in the small East Texas town where I grew up. It was a good place to be a cub reporter  ?  small enough to navigate but big enough to keep me busy and learning something every day. I soon had a stroke of luck.  Some of the old timers were on vacation or out sick and I got assigned to cover what came to be known as the Housewives' Rebellion. Fifteen women in my home town decided not to pay the social security withholding tax for their domestic workers. They argued that social security was unconstitutional, that imposing it was taxation without representation, and that  ?  here's my favorite part  ?  "requiring us to collect (the tax) is no different from requiring us to collect the garbage."  They hired themselves a lawyer  ?  none other than Martin Dies, the former congressman best known, or worst known, for his work as head of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 30s and 40s. He was no more effective at defending rebellious women than he had been protecting against communist subversives, and eventually the women wound up holding their noses and paying the tax.   http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0610-11.htm
