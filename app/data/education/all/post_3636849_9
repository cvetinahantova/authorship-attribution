My grandfather built magnificent clocks. Actually, he built many things, but he excelled at clocks.....grandmother, grandfather, desktop, etc.  As a child, I loved to stand in his woodshop and watch him work. He was of a careful sort; take your time, and pay attention to the grain. He built me toys, and sometimes he let me help.  I built a desk last month. The process is ongoing, but I've been learning small lessons as I work:  1)  No matter how warped a plank may be, you can make it work. It takes only time and pressure. And some screws.  2)  Cutting against the grain shows the true makeup of your wood.  3)  You can cover cracks and holes with filler; you can mask scratches by using varnish; you can do these things and more, but underneath it all a shitty piece of wood remains just that.  4)  Never be afraid to ask for some help.  5)  Projects worth the time will take much of it.  ___________________________________    playlist for 8/3  earshot - Wait a perfect circle - The Hollow skywynd - New Year Evolution josh groban - Oceano killing heidi - Weir pearl jam - Smile
