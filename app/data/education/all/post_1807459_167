So as it stands I'll be taking a boat into Vietnam.  I'm really wanting to get to HCMC but if I don't see this part of the country first I probably won't ever see it.  There isn't much to tell about today as I only came back to Phnom Penh and I'm keeping it pretty low key since I have to get up early tomorrow.  Yesterday ended up working out well.  I had some great fish and chips after blogging and then the rain cleared up and I cruised all over the town.  It is pretty cool to actually know your way around town.  I hit 3 or 4 different beaches and got to watch a great sunset at the end of the day.  I started on the book GJ gave me (Rich Dad Poor Dad) and it's really good and an easy read.  I think I'll finish it on the boat tomorrow.   I'm looking forward to getting out of Cambodia.  I've enjoyed my time here a lot but it's time for a change.  People need to update more.  Caleb and Becky (what and odd combination) have been doing good jobs but what has happened to the rest of you guys?  Give me something to read at night.
