my head is in a whirlwind...cant think proper....wait first while i think things out! i apologise. i just came home and cooked for myself a bowl of pasta... pesto  sauce...it was too oily...then i had yoghurt...so im not really that awake yet...   Â   kaleidoscope  is tomorrow, and i had my faith and hope concert tonite at the cpa (center of performing arts) in school and we screwed up the 2nd song...rushed as well and i could tell that mrs wan our conductress was not too glad...she seemed to tell me that i needed to smile....i did--a  plastic  one, which wasnt so pleasing an effect...  just got home and i hate using the com so late but titus nabbed it first and besides i had to eat dinner...my cousins are goin home soon, in fact now...so less noise for now...  i finished reading  the brethren  from  john grisham  and i thought it was good ... now im reading  anita shreve' s  the pilot's wife... so far so good...what i like about her writing is that it includes a lot of flashbacks and her writing is very detailed and flowery...and after i finish i will try to finish watership down and borrow the sequel-- other tales from watership down --and finish it before borrowing the next target-- anita shreve 's  fortune's rocks... i think im some anita shreve fan ... and her cover pics are so good ... the next target writer will be dean koontz...  i went to border on my last post right? i forgot to tell you how good the  emma bunton  album was...the title is  free me , which explains my msn nick...i heard the song 'take my breath away' on her previous album (no not the one that  jessica simpson  sang) and it was like a really nice memory, it was a song i hadnt heard for ages...  ok, im gonna sleep soon...i'll post again if i need to...cya!
