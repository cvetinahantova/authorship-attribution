I'm at work.  Nothing new.  Last night I worked on my HTML portfolio.  the work is slow, but steady.  Classes start today.  My Mpowepoint class is online, so I didn't have to get up early.  Tomorrow is my Illustrator class.  I do have to be up early for that.  LOL.  I'm such a night person.  How do I get into thes ethings?  It's for a good cause, so I shan't whine too much about it.    atched CSI Miami last night.  I love that show.  Also got to watch some reruns of Law and Order.  Stayed up late watching the history of barbarians on History Chanel.  It was so goo, and I should have wnet to bed.
