Did you know that you can see anyone's Drivers License on the net including your own? It's an American based site, but apparently it now links into Canada, and the Philippines, and other countries where they've been for nearly a year now. Just key in your first and last names and then hit the search button. Just disregard the "state" field, you can bypass it and just input the "city".  I just searched for my license, and there it was, picture and all. This something I didn't know you could do. I'm not sure I like this info out there ready for anyone to access. This is a serious breach of privacy!   http://www.license.shorturl.com
