*this post is dedicated to K--the rainbow of  my latest storm...*          Well, after the rain, there's always a small measure of calm that's still blanketed by the dampness of everything, but it's calm nonetheless.  That's how I feel now--like the "after-storm".  After yesterday's post, I felt kind of drained, but I think that's a good thing.  I think feeling drained like that must mean that I'm being purged of those bad feelings--otherwise, why would i feel "drained"? (didn't think about it like that, did ya?-lol)       Well, I think one thing that helps is validating the idea that the people in your life really should be there--although you  may never know in what capacity.  I can just say I really have to thank K for being the person that he is.  He came by today to hang out and I made dinner (which he SAYS was good, but he's nice like that...)  Well, not that I expected anything less, but we had a really good time.  We bounced back between playing playstation (he sucks at tennis-lol-j/k) to seriously discussing how we felt about life/love/etc. in general to being REALLY silly at Connect Four.  I don't know 'bout K, but that was one of the FUNNIEST things I've done in a long time--I had a good time.  I am very glad to know him--we ALL need a person like him in our lives, trust me.  So anyway, that totally lifted my spirits.  Also learned a lil more about him and how he sees things; explains a LOT for me(not in a bad way)--I like the way he thinks.          I am so sleepy I could just....uh...well...sleep!-lol.  Sorry, nothing profound to say there!:)            I know there's always gonna be a storm--ALWAYS.   The thing to remember is that wherever there's a storm, a rainbow lies somewhere--maybe not in your direction every time--but eventually, you'll see your rainbow.  K is a person I am so very happy to know and he, unknowingly, helped me remember that the rainbow does exist, even if I can't always remember to look for it.  (hey, K, did I blow your head up enough?!:))
