After a over long trip in the bus stinking and smelling from being couped up like chickens in a hatchery, we arrived at an town called Bidot, located in the french riviera a nice little place to hang out, but really a center of operations for our day excursion to Nice (pronounced neese). Neice was okay, quite a lazy wee town really but, it was built along the foreshore of the mediteranian sea, and for that you had all the things you may associate with such a setting. The beach was Awesome, I have never seen such blue water, blue within blue, and crystal clear too. even though it was a working day there were people lazing beside the beach, rollerblading, eating icecreams, drinking coffee, and generally enjoying the sun.
