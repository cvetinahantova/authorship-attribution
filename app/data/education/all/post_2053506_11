Today we had the pleasure of going to a tea room in Augusta, Kansas, called Miss Muzzie's Tea Room:     I found it by going to the tea room  urlLink map  at  urlLink  Teas . Which, by the way, is my favorite online place to tea shop.    We were way early - it was only 9:30 and they didn't open till 10:30 - but the owners were in the building and saw us peeking through the window.  So they actually let us in.  I was so surprised!  This was such a fun place.  This is the main seating area:     Then they had various seating areas throughout this cute little shop, like these:        They also have fun little hats you can put on and wear while you're having a tea party:     They also sell gifts and stuff at the front of the shop:     I bought a  urlLink tea shop mystery  book.  I can't wait to read them all, I think they'll be fun.   I also bought a cute little tea bag holder.  I had a great time and would love to go back and have tea sometime when they're actually open.
