to WiFi, or not to pirate WiFi? i can remember times when i was little that we had cable tv for free. my dad would sneak over to my neighbors house while they were gone, throw a splitter on their cable line, and manage to hide the fact from them for years.  so now, faced with a similar chance, without all the sneaking around... should i continue to sneak onto the WiFI network i find in my new building, or should i just let the charter communications guy actually install the internet for me when he gets here tomorrow? free internet... or $50 a month for internet and cable tv, what's a guy to choose?  in other thoughts, i think the porch here is great. maybe would could throw up a couple of pics of some humming birds, gloyds ramshakle plants, a couple of cigarettes, and a crazy durnken neighbor or two just to make the place feel like home.  anyway, its good to have a computer again. let the blogging commence.  ps. there was a fire in my aparment today on comstock while i was out. three fire trucks... more to that story later. now i gotta sleep.
