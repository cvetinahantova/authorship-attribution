ok, so i've been over at ellies since sat. we watched movies did whatever, had protein shakes, watched movies, and went to sleep about 3am. Then on sun we woke up about 10:3oam cuz her little bro. jacob kept coming downstairs and being loud. At 1 30pm we went to good will while jacob and their mom went to baseball practice. At good will ellie bought me this gothic wedding dress that i'm supposed to wear on the first day if school. I think i'm going to wear it on halloween instead. Then we went home and i called my mom to pick us up. Right before she got there the pizza man arrived and we snuck upstairs to her house and stole a piece... mwahahaha. Then my mom took us home and her friend tammy called and she went swimming at tammy's house. We fixed my room up and talked on the phone to tony and tony. Lots of funny stuff happened that day. BUT i'm going to have ellie write about that in her diary and she's going to make a book out of it. The tony's are very funny. Ellie and I with the tony's is hilarious. The stupidest stuff goes on when we are all together.          More stuff later. byebye
