Hey Class,   In case you'd like to have a link of some or all of the class linked to your blog (like mine), here's the code you need:   <h6>Class Blogs</h6>   <ul>  <a href="http://www.popaganda.blogspot.com">Trena</a>  </li>  </ul>  then copy the following URLS (addresses) into the portion of code above which matches & the name where Trena's name is -- before the /ul tag (underline):    http://www.dustin-ebay-mediaclass.blogspot.com  -Dustin http:// pattyannblake.blogspot.com  -Patty http:// sunkistsands.blogspot.com  -Heather http:// centerstage777.blogspot.com  -Brittany http:// aliciahatton.blogspot.com  -Alicia http:// joshanderson.blogspot.com  -Josh http:// katieisperfectineveryway.blogspot.com  -Katie http:// tracysblogmedia.blogspot.com  -Tracy http:// tgoveonemedia.blogspot.com  -Terrence http:// stoogess1.blogspot.com  -Amber   the other option is to  urlLink EMAIL ME  and I'll just copy the code for the whole class into an email for you & you can copy it.  The things that you should recognize about the code above is that you can use it to insert  urlLink HYPERLINKS  into your blogs anytime you want to.  the <li> code is for LINES and the <a href=> is the linking code.  Of course this isn't for the class -- it's just for those who are curious or risky...  peace~
