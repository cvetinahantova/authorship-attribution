I was completely blown away by Diana tonight.  She was awesome.   I have to change my final two now, to Latoya and Diana.  This week Jasmine is gone.  Her voice is just too weak,and she needs alot more life experience.    But, she did cry during the number thingy, so she may squeeze in on sympathy votes.    I actually voted tonight, twice.  There is a first time for anything.
