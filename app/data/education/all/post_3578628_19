"Friends don't let friends plan things without letting the person who is planning it know that they are going to go or not"  It's a pretty long one but a pretty important one to memorize.  If you can remember to call and tell the inviter that you want to go, the inviter will continue to make you an invitee.  As corny as this sounds, some people haven't picked up on the concept yet.
