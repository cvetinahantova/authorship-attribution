Jumping on the quiz bandwagon   Since everyone else seems to have done it. Yeah, I'm a peer pressure whore. Live with it.   1) Using band names (or artists), spell out your first name: Creedence Clearwater Revival Luis Alberto Spinetta Alice in Chains U2 Stratovarius  2) Have you ever had a song written about you? If you count all the Christmas songs written about Santa, then yes.   3) What song makes you cry? There are many  Blind Guardian  songs that catch me on the soft side, such as  The Eldar  and  Thorn . And then of course there's  Demons & Wizards - Gallows Pole .   4) What song makes you happy? Oh, there are so many... But if I had to pick one, I'd go with either  Carnaval toda la Vida  by  Los Fabulosos Caddilacs  or  Bobby Mc Ferrin - Don't worry, be happy .  5) What do you like to listen to before bed? Whatever is on the playlist. And since that includes everything I own, then it could be just about anything, from Heavy Metal to Electronica to Tango.  6) Name a song by Coal Chamber. No clue. And I hope that's not a real song title, or I'd feel very awkward.   7) Who was/were your idol/s when you were younger? Isaac Newton. Then I found out he was a crook, and that didn't change a thing. He was a fricken genius.  8) First album you ever bought? AC/DC - Live.
