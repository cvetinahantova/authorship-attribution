Christian Music & U2 Fan Sites Spread CCM Letter Controversy 5/28/2004 6:36:02 PM Jay Swartzendruber Have you ever read a letter to the editor in CCM and just KNEW you had to respond to someone's "so-called" point by writing one yourself? I know the feeling--though, back in the day, CCM never printed mine. (But that's okay, because "I'm smart enough...I'm good enough...and dog-gone it, people like me.")  CCM reader Rich Copley recently read one such letter to the editor, and he decided to respond. The only thing is, Rich's response was, well, LOADED. Not just because it contained 900 words of articulate, jam-packed content, but because Rich decided to share his response with the more than 200,000 people in his city! And from there, it became an "international incident." (Come again? Exactly.)  Turns out that Rich Copley is the arts writer with one of Kentucky's premier newspapers, the Lexington Herald-Leader. And after reading Christopher Stone's letter to the editor in which he stated that U2's Bono is "not even a very good example of the Christian walk" (CCM's May issue), Copley wielded the power of his sword. Indeed, earlier this month the Lexington Herald-Leader ran Copley's editorial ("We Know Bono's Christian By His Love") which outlined Stone's letter to CCM and then offered a compelling response. Then, before you could say, "Achtung Baby," Christian music and U2 fan sites started posting links to the Herald-Leader's article on the front page of their sites. And the rest is... still unbelievable.  Care to check out the Herald-Leader's editorial? (I thought so.)
