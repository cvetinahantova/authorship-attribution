Relaxed Rum Runner  Taking it easy — that's how you prefer to handle whatever comes your way. Like a cool, blended rum runner, you like to keep a delicate balance between the sweet and sour things in life. Calm and collected, you're up for anything your friends throw your way, from joining a book club or taking an art class to trying every cocktail in your cookbook.  Bottom line — you're a laid-back soul who likes to stay connected with her friends and have a good time. Whenever the girls join forces — whether you're gabbing over pedicures or painting the town red — people count on you to hold the group together with your carefree and irresistible sense of fun. Stay cool!
