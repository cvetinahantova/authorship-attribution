So I moved to Egypt 11 months ago to work in a small town of no consequence. The only impressive thing about the small town is its name: Al Rehab. Yes, I moved to Egypt to live in Rehab!!! The town had no life and no prospect of life. It was good for people who had families but not me (I had just left the nightlife of London!)  I stayed in Rehab for a while, rarely venturing out. But then I moved to a slightly larger town called Maadi. It's closer to places of alcohol and loud music! I am happier now!  The point of setting up this blog is to educate the world about the crazy things that happen here. I've already got to the point where I take many things for granted when I could be sharing these experiences with others!  Today: I went on a falucca (which is a small sail boat) just around the Nile for an hour. It was very relaxing, or it would be but for the Italian film crew filming us. We still don't know why they were filming us but hey, maybe I'll be famous! LOL!
