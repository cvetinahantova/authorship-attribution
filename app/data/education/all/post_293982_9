Hello to no one who is reading my blog!   I'm finally, after a lot of soul-searching and several false starts, restarting my blog.    I have done some research on what people do on their blogs.  I have seen people who use a blog to comment on news with their political views, to mock, to inform others about their embarrassing illnesses, to make cryptic comments, to make themselves look better than other people with blogs, to start revolutions of words, to get previously unpopular ideas into the mainstream, to be pretentious, to give us too much information, to comment on other blogs, to document every time they use the bathroom, or to make inane comments.  You'll probably get a piece of almost every type on this website.   You can guess which ones I will avoid :).   But first, why is this the purple pen.org?  Primarily, because my life is not-for-profit :).  However, it isn't because purple has surfaced as my favorite color.  Actually, a  urlLink study  conducted by the Pilot corporation and published in an  urlLink article  on finding Irish jobs.  Read the study - its silly, but interesting :).  By the way, I have about 40 pens at my desk, many purple.
