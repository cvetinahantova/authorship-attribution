Step one of our landscaping resolve: I develop a course in map making where Jaelyn and Addison and I measured the dimensions and borders of the whole property in order to make a to-scale map of the entire place and plot out a long-term plan.   In order to create some incentive for the task, I framed our map-making quest inside of the King / Princess / Prince game/alter.reality that we were already playing.    ME: We need to venture forth from the Castle and measure the borders of our Kingdom.  We shall make a great map…  PRINCE HEINRICK: (played by Addison) A big one?    ME: Yes, a big map,  So that we…  P. H. : A rea’y, rea’y big one map? (Addison still has no “L”s)  ME: Yes.  A really big one.  So once we have a map…  P.H.: (now the prince is hopping up and down with the every modifier) A rea’y, rea’y, rea’y big one!?!  ME: So that with our really big map, we can take better care of our Kingdom’s lands.   PRINCESS EMILY: (played by Jaelyn) But Daddy, if we go out into our kingdom, the people from the neighboring lands may see us and attack us!  (Really.  She said that they may attack us.  Is this what it means to grow up under the regime of G.W.?)  ME: Oh.  Well.  That may be true of some of our neighbors, but I’m sure that there would be many neighbors who would be very kind….we could forge alliances with them.  P. E.:  But if we clean up our borders, then the people from the neighboring countries might come into our borders.   ME: So?   P.E.:  And they might damage our possessions.  (Really.  She said “damage our possessions.”  And really?!  Where did she get this capitalist hoarding bent anyway?)  So Lynn sprayed massive amounts of poison on the borderlands of weeds and while a couple of them are saggy – I guess I’m disappointed that they didn’t respond a little more like a magic spell.  You know – all wither and brown up in one fell swoop.  Still we hack away at our weeds – hope you’re finding –   Peace~
