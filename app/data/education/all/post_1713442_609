urlLink Teaching about the Life and Health of Cells. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury.  From the ERIC Digest:  The cell is "the ultimate irreducible form of every living element, and...from it emanate all the activities of life both in health and in sickness." Rudolph Ludwig Carl Virchow (1858, translated 1860)  We've learned a lot about living cells since Robert Hooke (1665) viewed cork through a crude microscope and likened the hollow chambers to the cells of a monastery. Now we know that living cells are dynamic micro-environments, complete with microtubule transport networks and protein motors (see  urlLink http://www.hhmi.org/news/vale.html ). With the development of cell theory in 1839 (Mazzarello, 1999), Biology became a theoretical science, and with the publication of "Die Cellularpathologie" (Virchow, 1858), modern clinical medicine gained a scientific foundation. Since then, good health came to be viewed as an outward expression of healthy cells, with disease arising from the cells of a tissue. Now, modern biotechnology is moving us along previously unimagined avenues to health that involve the use of undifferentiated cells (stem cells) in developing cell therapies, replacing diseased or dysfunctional cells with new, functioning cells. Biologists' understanding of cells has been greatly enriched in recent decades (Flannery, 1999). Though a long established field of study, cell biology has been transformed from the study of microscopic curiosities to a theory-based study of life itself, and now to a powerful new tool for creating health by marshalling the body's own life forces. It seems time for the study of cells in school biology to become transformed as well.
