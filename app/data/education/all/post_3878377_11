We can just automatically without thinking say that it is love that gives meaning to our lives... Napag-isipan ko rin yan, at naramdaman ko, maaari nating sabihin yan ngunit di naman nating lubos na naiintindin ang kabuuan at hiwaga ng pag-ibig at buhay. However, we live life one at a time loving even without understanding, maybe it is meant to be that way.  I remember now I have jorge, I love him so. He is all that matters to me now. Perhaps at the end of the day, I won't be able to fully comprehend why I feel this way, I just feel it. He is never a perfect person like I am, with all his flaws..but that did not stop me from loving him I accept him just the way he is!  Kahit makulit siya, napaka-unpredictable,minsan nakakainis na ewan...ngunit andito pa rin ako. Ganun talaga, di ko man lubos maintindihan ang mga bagay-bagay ngunit parati naman akong umaasang maintindihan ko ang kahulugan nito sa buhay ako.  Maraming salamat sa taong nagmamahal sakin.  Jo
