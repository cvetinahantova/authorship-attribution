peter sensei was absent today. michael sensei took over. he has a totally different teaching style and he was more forgiving than peter sensei. we hit actual men cuts on the advanced class today. finally getting the feeling of actually cutting an opponent wearing bogu. training was not that tiring. somehow or rather when peter sensei is around, we are pushed to our limits more. hopefully we will see him on sunday, no matter how dreadful our training session might end up.
