We need a plan of attack for our research project. I think we have a lot of knowledge about the Simpsons as a media product, but we haven't really deeply investigated the theoretical angle to apply. Originally we used the angle that there are marketing related and highly commercialized plot lines and that these together while subversive in nature reify traditional American ideals. We have also aaplied connectedness theory and brand community. I think this is a good place to start. We could study the communtiy and how it impacts consumption practices for the members. We can justify studying the Simpsons (as opposed to other media products) by saying this is the longest running tv program with a devoted fanbase that tackles current social issues and has an enormous impact on global audiences and pop culture. This isn't just a show, it is a socailly impacting media product, like Coca-Cola that gives people all over the world a perspective on America. Thoughts?
