Today I went to a street party in Gwydir Street to watch Cath play her set again.  Unfortunately in typical English fashion the heavens decided to open so I was reduced to watching under an umbrella. Cath was just as good as the other night though despite the obstacles and the rest of the audience seemed as impressed as I was. I didn't stay long though as I felt tired, tired, tired again:  I bought a copy of the Guardian and a Caramel bar (couldn't get them in France of course that's my excuse) and fell asleep on the settee around 2pm.  I still feel exhausted but I'm not in a panic about it.  If it is the dreaded post viral fatigue nastiness (and I think it is) I have to stay at home for a couple of months to get better then so be it.  It could be a good opportunity to spend some time with my family and forge stronger ties with them.  I know that the summer school job is likely to completely wipe me out and so perhaps the best thing to do would be to get out of it now rather than go and end up having to leave because I'm just too  exhausted to go on.  I'll talk to Mum about it because I know that she's used to living on her own and I think I should respect her right to have her own space if that's what she wants.  Right, I'm going home to get some sleep as that's all my body seems to want to do at the moment and I think it's pointless to fight it.
