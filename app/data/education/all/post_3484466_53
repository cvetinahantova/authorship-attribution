Yeah, wow. Ok. I dunno. Tegan is apparently  asleep... pretty early if you ask me. Anyway, I'm off to watch a movie with my  parents, even though I've seen it before.... I just went to Home Depot and got some really cool  earmuffs, and then to Dairy Queen, where they apparently have an extremely bad  night crew... I ordered a banana split (drive-thru), and I pulled up to the  window and the lady tries to hand it to me in a dish with the spoon all stuck in  it and everything. Like I'm going to eat it while I'm driving. Possible, but  very unlikely. Anyway, I kinda gave her a funny look and said, "Can I get a lid  and a bag?", "Oh, alright". She hands me the banana split and has me hold it  while she goes and gets the lid and the bag, and then just hands me the lid and  the bag and closes the window... I'm like, oh great. So, upon attempting to put  the lid on, I find that it's actually another bottom piece, so they don't even  fit together... So I just crammed it together, stuck it in the bag and hoped for  the best... maybe she was new or something...  Anyway, off to the movie then  Current Music: Rupert Hine - With One  Look
