I would always spend moments in silence trying to figure out where I fit in the biggest and greatest scheme of things. Where do I belong? I have to seek and find my niche in this place where I live...I think I found it but not totally, not wholly! It is though important how I love and see my day to day experiences as a contribution to my own growth thus have ripple effect in the growth of others and the people I deeply touch in one way or another and eventually land in the very heart of the matter---my very place in the greater scheme of things...so I begin with yesterday!     Yesterday (Sunday) all my troubles seemed so far away (parang awit!!! he he he) I have great time with Jorge, Tina and Kuya Joseph. We had fun in STA Lucia, just spending the whole time there playing kid's stuffs. We did enjoy esp. when we ended up eating so much as if the next day is a judgement day for us. I love to be in Jorge's company the excitement is so inexhaustible. However, I am worried sick now, he's leaving soon...i'll just have to grab on the memories he'll leave behind. Oh heart! How can you be fool enough!  Today, I went to school with my desire to do my things here, to work on somethings in the student council, to finish homeworks and the like. I look forward to have a wonderful day today. I just feel so oblivious to the surroundings I live now--seminarians, nuns, priests all are also seeking and trying to find themselves in the scheme of things...     We are all grateful then. For this great life that we live each day, for the challenges that we face, the beauty and bounty of life.
