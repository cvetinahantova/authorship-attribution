I survived the audit.  Barely, but I survived.  Only after a long weekend of complete mental loafing could I return to work.  So in the interest of that loafing, I decided to watch a couple of movies...  Evil Dead:  I'd never seen the original work in the Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell trilogy, so I decided to watch it.  Wow.  This had to be one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen.  Especially since it tried to be genuinely frightening and serious.  I'm not surprised it gained a cult following, due to the overdone gore and campiness, but what a lame movie.  The special effects at the end, once the last two are killed, are especially funny.  Things that seemed cool in the '80's....  One and a half stars.  Army of Darkness:  This movie always cracks me up.  I give this one credit for not even trying to be serious.  I know- I skipped Evil Dead 2 in the sequence.  I've seen it somewhat recently and didn't feel the need to brush up.  However, Army of Darkness is one of my favorite "guilty pleasures" movies from my mislead childhood.  The complete disregard for any level of logic is so blatant and beautiful that I can't resist cheering as Ash fires off approximately 56 rounds from his rifle without reloading.  3 stars.  That's it for the weekend.  Back later today with my political and economic post.
