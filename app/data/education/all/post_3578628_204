If I'd known today was going to be so much fun, I'd said "okay fine".  But really? This wasn't just the first day of band camp.  Andy, Spencer, and I now have a great story to share that involves rain, storming, driving, McDonalds, baseball game, etc.  I won't tell it here because it'd be fun to talk about Friday when we all get together for a party to welcome Andy back home.  Hope you think about this and plan to come Friday.
