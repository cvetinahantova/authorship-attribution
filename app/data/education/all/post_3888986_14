I just finished as much as I could stomach to read of diaries and letters by Etty Hillesum.  As closely as I can describe her, she was the Anne Frank of the 20 somethings.  The book titled her name is two books put together.  The first is her diary leading up to her going to Westerbork.  (Westerbork is the place where Anne Frank and her family were also sent... along with most Dutch jews and many German jews as well.  It was a camp that housed tens of thousands of jews waiting for the trains to Poland.  The train left weekly on a Tuesday.  She was a member of the Jewish Council.  This council were the "leaders" of the camp and have varied jobs of sorts.  Etty died at 20.  She was a lawer and had a doctorate degree of some sort.  Her family was very scholarly and her brother Mischa was a musical prodigy.    Her letters and her life's writing were consumed with humanity and beauty.  She found all things beautiful even in unthinkable situations.  situations that we have no understanding of.  so incomprehansible.  She would write these letters outside, sitting on a grassy spot and discuss teh beaty of the world, and the goodness in everyone, including thos soldiers who mastered over her andher family.    Her words are eloquent and strike the chord that connects your heart to your gut.    she never stopped giving to others, giving of herself, her food, her belingings for the comfort of others, and also her family when the eventually joined her in Westerbork.  she  saw to the needs of the orphans and sick...  she worked until passing out or fainting when exaustion consumed her.  She never once complains in her letters.  Never once breaks down into the "why's" that I can only imagine myself being absorbed with.    During her time in Westerbork she grew quite ill and while on release in amsterdam stayed wit friends for five months until she was well wnough to return.  During the time she was sick, she wrote to her friends in the camp expressing how badly she yearned to return to them and their company.  She was approached many times by people who were a part of the resistance movement, who  wanted to get her out, and although many survived the war, she declined the offer.  The council was disolved in 43 and during that time 60 of the 120 members were permitted to return to Amsterdam, and life.  Because her family was now at the camp, she declined to leave, because of the relationships she had built, and she believed that her influence may still have an effect on the lives of her faimly and her brother.    On more than  one occassion, it did.  But in the end, it didn't.    Her last letter was written on a post card from the freight train taking them to Poland.  she scribbled it down and threw it fromt he train.  It was found and mailed by some farmers.  It read:  Christine, Opening the Bible at random I find this: "The Lord is my high tower."  I am sitting on my rucksack in the middle of a full freight car.  Father, Mother, and Mischa are a few cars away.  In the end, the departure came without warning.  On sudden special orders from The Hague.  We left the camp singing, Father and Mother firmly and calmly, Mischa too.  We sahll be travelling for three days.  Thank you for all your kindness and care.  Friends left behind will still be writing to Amsterdam; perhaps you will hear something from them.  Or from my last letter from camp.                          Good-bye for now from the four of us.                           Etty   I don't know why I felt that I should share this, except that it had such an impact on my and my thinking, I thought to share it in writing.  Trying to speak of it getts jammed up in a knot in my throat where it doesn't seem to come out in words.  Only tears.
