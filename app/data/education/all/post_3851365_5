Today I took our foreign exchange student, plus another foreign exchange student from Austria staying with a different host family, to the Wild Animal Park.  This was the first time the two girls met, and they got along instantly.  What a relief for Esen to finally find someone with whom to converse in German.  I had to take Wendy with us, because Craig had to go to a meeting, and we did not want to leave her alone.  When we got back, Wendy tried doing another spell in the backyard lighting another piece of paper on fire.  The fire immediately got big enough to be worrisome, so she came to me for help putting it out.  She says that she is through lighting papers on fire, and will only light candles.  We stressed that this can only be under our supervision, when one or both of us is at home.  I got upset with Wendy at the Wild Animal Park when she told me that she tried to use her debit card at the gift shop, and it got rejected.  This is the 5th, and she gets her SSI payment on the 1st, which means she managed to spend $550 in less than 5 days.  Wendy couldn't figure out how where the money went, so when we got home I called the credit union and it turns out that she had purchased something on the internet, and the company preauthorized too much money, which was released back to Wendy later today, so she actually has a balance of about $78.  I wanted to take Wendy to an introductory Kabbalah meeting tonight, to try to get her into a more "mainstream" spirituality - something that does not involve candles and spells - but she tried on some pants and got extremely upset because she could not fit in them, so I told her to take a walk instead.  I have not heard anything from Dr. Castillo's office about the biopsies.  I don't even know where she took them from, it looked like she was scraping my uterus.  The last thing I need right now is cancer.
