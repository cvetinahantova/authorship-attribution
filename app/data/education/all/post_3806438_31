Reports of Mike Krzyzewski  urlLink talking with the Lakers  about their vacant coaching position leaves me in a quandary.  Alas, I love Duke and Krzyzewski, and I hate the Lakers.  If Krzyzewski left, where would that leave Duke?  And would I find myself routing for the Lakers?  That would be awful.  Who would replace the legendary coach?  Clearly it would have to be assistant coach Steve Wojciechowski, the only name that could rival the outgoing Krzyzewski.
