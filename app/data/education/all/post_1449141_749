urlLink Eschaton  A RUSH TO HYPOCRISY: It seems according to at least one conservative, the sanctity of marriage only counts when you're trying to stop others from heading down the aisle. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh has announced divorce number three. This is the same Rush Limbaugh who, in a diatribe against gay marriage, said, "I really do not even think marriage is a right. Marriage is a responsibility. It's not a gift that somebody says, 'Hey, now it's time for you to get married. It's our bestowal to you.' It's a commitment that you make and it is a responsibility that you accept." Limbaugh also attacked correspondent Connie Chung, demanding to know, "How many divorces has Connie had?" And he lamented the "quadrupling in divorce rates," saying, "We have a behavioral problem. We have a love problem. We have a spiritual problem."
