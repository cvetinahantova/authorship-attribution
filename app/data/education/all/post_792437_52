Productive time!    Â  Mmm....everyone has their time of day in which they find they work really well. I suppose mine is late at night, as I learn a whole lot more at midnight or 1 a.m. rather than at 6 o'clock in the evening. Yep yep..it's about 3 a.m. here and I'm here working on a paper. But yet at the same time, I only like morning tests...the best time being 9 o'clock...weird...and the most sleep I like getting...5.5-6 hours max..any more than that, and I'm tirrrreeed..
