Good news and bad news from the postman today. First I got a refund from a finance company I have paid off. Just under 90 UKP (I had paid them to close the account, then they took the monthly direct debit as well).   The bad news was the insurance company had charged me twice (once by card on the phone and once by direct debit) for the changes following the change of cars. Oh well, I suppose another phone call will resolve that one - its just a hassle.
