Hey... Today I started reading this one book that one of my friends gave to me. It's called  Go Ask Alice  and it's a real diary by an anonymous author (Alice). It's about this one girl (Alice) who wants to fit in. She meets someone in her old school that asks her to come to an "autograph party" and gets her started on drugs. I can't believe how descriptive the book is although I'm only on page thirty-six.  Anyways I'm at school right now and nothing interesting is happening so I'm going to go and I will write back later when I am at home. Bye!
