I was out running errands today, when I got an unexpected job offer.  There is a good side to this, and a bad side to this.  The good side:  without even knowing that I was looking, someone offered me a job in which I can make a pretty good amount of money.  The bad side:  the job is at Friendly's.  Ugh.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do.  I said that I would think it over and get back to them in a few days.  On one hand, I need a job, and this one has kind of fallen into my lap.  On the other hand, I swore to myself that I did not want to go back to Friendly's.    I was actually offered a position as a supervisor, but I turned that down immediately.  I don't want that kind of responsibility, and I don't need a position like that for my resume anymore.  Then, I was offered a server position, with whatever kinds of hours I want.  That one is a little more tempting.  I made more money as a server than I ever did as a supervisor, and if I could get the hours I wanted, it really would be a good job to have.    So, I told them that I would think about it for a few days, and they were quick to ensure that I left with an application in hand.  I had to laugh when I looked it over.  First, there was the normal application, like what you would fill out for any job similar to that.  Then, there's the second half.  Apparently, Friendly's now administers an "interest survey" along with their applications.  In looking it over, it almost seems like more of a psych evaluation... although after working there for a year and a half, I guess I can understand why they would resort to that.  I guess for the time being, I'm kind of biding my time for a few more days to see if any of the other places I applied to call me back, and I'll take things from there.
