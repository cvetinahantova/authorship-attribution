Reminder: it is Illegal for non-profits like MSPJC to endorese Any political candidate.  Given that situation. What is to be done...?   Givne that:   there is more than enough groups (Dem party, PACS, labor unions, Sierra Club) that are working with a single goal: unelect King George.   Givent that::   Almost no one is talking about what happens after Kerry is elected.  Therefore: :  Small Progressive nonprofits who cannot participate in the election anyway, can fill the void by reminding people that long term social change does not happen by enlightened political leaders, but by grassroots mobilization of large numbers of people.  Lets create a movement for a social just economy in the world free of the dependency of an oil economy and military intervention to support that dependency.  Domestically we need a new aboltionism that will abolish the culture of fear that supports the patriot acts. By disinvesting in the petro-chemical industry and military, we have billions free to invest in sustainable energy, sustainable jobs, and sustainable communities.  As long as there is no masses or organized people, both parties will continue to ignore the interests and needs of workers and majority of the worlds population  and serve the interests of corporations.  There is much to done After Kerry is elected.
