wow, i've been gone a while and they really fixed up the blogger system!  i love it.  anyway, i've decided to get away from livejournal and start posting semi-private entries again.  only a few people know this address...most importantly my ultra-sensitive roommate and her boyfriend don't know the address.  somehow she always seems to read too much into my entries and come up with something that i didn't really say that offends her or makes her think that i am secretly mad at her.  it's really quite frustrating.         anyway, enough of that.  i spent today cleaning the whole apartment.  i seem to be the only one that ever cleans the bathroom.  i've cleaned it about 6 times since we've moved in (about once a month...which i admit is not often enough) compared to amber only "dusting" it and washing the floor once.  true, i don't have a job right now so i have time to spare, but i do have a lot of other stuff that i'm working on.  that's okay, at least i know it's getting cleaned well if i do it myself (NOT saying that amber wouldn't clean it well if she did clean it!!!).          continuing on though...i scrubbed the outside of the frigerator (gosh, that looks so wrong...shouldn't frige have a 'd' in it?  oh well.) and the kitchen sink...the bathtub, the bathroom floor, the toilet, the bathroom sink, the living room floor, the entry floor, the kitchen floor, the breakfast nook, the kitchen counters, the drying rack.  i also did my laundry.       i took a shower today and forgot that i had opened the window all of the way for the fumes to escape.  i went to grab the soap behind the shower liner that covers the window, so i pulled it back and managed to give my neighbors a full frontal show.  actually, i ended up just flashing my bosom and quickly shut the liner.  don't think anyone saw.  it doesn't really matter anyway though since i change with my blinds open all the time.  granted, i still have undergarments on, but still.  i'm sure if anyone was watching they can imagine what i look like without them on.         took a long nap and then watched donnie darko.  my school webpage is coming along quite nicely.  once it's up and running i'll post the link.  i have 3 baby tomatoes.  they are so cute.  kind of keeps me from wanting to eat them.  they are all on one plant.  the second plant has flowered a lot but doesn't seem to be developing any tomatoes.  i'm kind of worried about that.  it probably just needs some time.         i'm sort of hurt.  i had come up with the idea to play poker tonight with drew and his buddies.  i was really excited since this was the first time i was going to actually play poker.  well, he mentioned last night that it was going to take place today...and asked me if i was still in.  i didn't say that i wasn't but for some reason, i was never contacted today about playing.  so, i guess he's mad at me too.  whatever.  i really don't need any friends.  plus, i probably wouldn't have gone anyway, but i still would've liked for him to make sure i didn't want to participate...especially since it was my idea in the first place.         other news?  i'm not sure there is any.  this is long enough, don't you agree?!?!?!  alright, i'm going to go wallow in my own self-misery.
