Damn,  urlLink that song  surely clings on... As if it had a life of it own.   Byhakee byhakee fly me through space Take me away, far from this place. Byhakee byhakee what must I do To go for a ride with you? Byhakee byhakee now heed my call. I've done the spells. I've done them all. Out of tartarean darkness appear and fly me away from here.  I don't know how to describe you, to see you is a mind-blowing thing. Not moles, crows, nor ants are quite like you, nor partially decomposed human skin.  Aaaaaahh!  Byhakee byhakee now that you're here I've changed my mind, I'm filled with fear. People who go with you don't reappear. So leave me alone. I'll stay at home. I will forget we ever met. I must not and won't recall!  (Full lyrics  urlLink here )
