I found a way to get over my wanting a puppy.  I house-sat for a family from my church over the weekend.  Really, I went over there Saturday afternoon and walked their dog--a big, black gentle beast with the schnoz of a spaniel.  Sniff, sniff, sniff; oh, boy.  Anyway. I spent the afternoon and evening there to keep Fudge company, feed her supper, and take her outside again a couple times before going home.  Then I came back in the morning to feed her breakfast and walk her again.  And then I came back after church to walk her yet again.  I decided, that's really too much commitment for me.  Sorry!  And then there was the licking my hand and the fur making me sneeze and the licking my leg and it was just quite enough.  I guess it's kind of like children--I enjoy them as long as they don't come home with me.
