Today I got my hair cut and highlighted.  I really do like how my hair looks highlighted!  The cut is great too.  I am so glad I found someone closer, and who is much cheeper!!  She is also a Christian, and that's awsome!  Then it was off to my weekly allergy shots.  Gosh, as they increase the dosage, it hurts more.  My right arm has a bumpr so big, that I'm going to tease John tonight and tell him to "look at how big my tricep muscle is getting".  Now off to ballet, so a busy but fun filled day.  Even allergy shots can be fun (that is when you get a mocha while you're waiting during your half hour caution period -to make sure you don't blow up like a balloon or something =).
