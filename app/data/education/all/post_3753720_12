I want to recommend a few programs that are available on the Mac and PC. For people who like simulation games. I want to recommend X-Plane by  Laminar Research .  X-Plane is the most realistic general-aviation flight-simulator ever released for personal computers. X-plane allows you to enter the geometric dimensions of your aircraft, and the experience a real-time flight simulation of that aircraft with engineering-accuracy flight dynamics. X-Plane is the first simulation to feature 3-D modeling of the entire continental United States. Features dynamic speech synthesis for verbal air traffic control communications. With support for all Gravis joysticks.  Classic version also available.   Here is a screenshot from the game:        I'm able to play X-Plane version 750 on a 933MHz iBook G4 running Mac OS 10.3 with 640MB of RAM with an ATI Radeon 9200 graphics card.   If anyone has this same setup or is using an iBook G4 you should change the texture resolution in X-Plane. Go to Options, and in the pull down menu choose "rendering." When the windows comes up change the texture resolution from "high" to "normal" so you don't push your graphics card to the limit. This will also speed the game up a bit.
