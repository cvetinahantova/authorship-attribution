urlLink Dave Chappelle has signed a 2-year extension for $50 million . Most will argue that is too much for a TV personallity to make, but I say this is money well spent. The $50 million alone was justified by the sketch where the following was uttered, "Does Wayne Brady have to choke a bitch?" Still the funniest sketch ever produced.
