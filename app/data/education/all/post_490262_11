Well, I finished my little sewing project on Tuesday.  And it's not half bad...  Now all I need to do is the laundry piled up on the bed, floor, chest, etc. and someone might even be able to  see  my project.  I haven't been on-line in a few days.  I always have all these grand plans for my time off.  Usually I think something like this--"I'll just stay at home for a change and do nothing.  I'll clean the house, read a book, play with the baby, walk the dogs.  I won't put on make up.  I won't go out.  It will be great."  Then, much like this week, I will make plans upon plans and finally spend one day trying to cram all my chores in.  That said, I have had some fun the last couple days.  I had some moms and babies from my Mommy group over.  Since I haven't been able to go to Mommy group since starting back to work in September, it was fun to see and talk to other moms and see how the babies have changed.    I have also watched some movies on video (No, not DVD--I'm a teacher, remember?  I have no money for fancy-schmancy technology.)  My husband hates my taste in movies so I don't seem to watch many anymore.  Hmmm, since the TV schedule is looking pretty sad for the weekend, maybe I'll go on a video binge...  Rent many girlie movies and stuff myself with low-calorie, fake butter popcorn...  Woo hoo!
