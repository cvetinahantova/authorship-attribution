okay, so i lied.  i really don't hate shea.  and i don't hate either of the other boys.  and i do consider them to be my friends.  and the truth is that i love them...and that they are my closest friends.  i don't want them out of my life, and i want to be in theirs.  i just get so frustrated sometimes that i say things i don't really mean.  doesn't everyone though?
