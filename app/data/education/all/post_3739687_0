hello,  well i hope everyone's summer is going as well as mine.  i had my first thai massage yesterday and it was awesome.  cheap too.  i'll give you a brief description if for no other reason than to encourage you all to speed up your vacation to bangkok plans.  -  first i walked into a curtained off area  and changed into a pajama set they provided for me.  then a very nice thai women came in and brought me hot tea, i'm not sure what kind i think it was caffeniated though, then another woman came in and washed my feat with a scented oil,(for those of you who know about how awful my feet are you can imagine how bad i felt for the poor woman) then the massage began.  it is very different than the ones i've had before.  thai massage involves the giver using their entire body. at times i felt i was being stretched more  than anything.  at one point she flipped me on top of her with her feet in my back, it was very amusing, we both laughed.  i'm still a little confused on the exchange rate but i only paid a few bucks for an hour.  o.k. so who's coming to see me?!?  other than that not much to tell i didn't make it to lumphini park yesterday so i think i'm going to go today.  i've been looking forward to seeing some trees.  btw i love pineapple now.  i don't know if it is that much better over here or if being in asia changed my taste in food. either way i eat two or three helpings of it everyday.  wendi and karen (friends for oxford) got into town last night.  they invited me to go to the beach with them and i accepted.  we are going to a full moon festival on an island.  that's all the details i have at the moment i'll let you know when i find out more.  once i get back then the job search will commence.  wish me good luck.  i've got a few ideas and phone numbers so i'm  hoping it won't be that hard.  most people i've met seem to think i can find one extremely easily.  let's hope they are right!  bye,  jane
