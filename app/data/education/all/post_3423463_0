sure this will be the same as most firsts...  just sitting here fighting monkeys on a text adventure online. it's fun but pointless. working up the gumption to go study my phys chem right now. not obligatory or graded, so it's harder to get motivated, fascinating though it is.  i guess i'm not really writing this for anyone, just as a way to journalize my thoughts, i suppose. interesting it is: is there such a thing as a freudian typo? as in, when i go to write "journalize my thoughts" and come out with "journalize my thought," does that mean anything? is it true that the male brain can only focus on one thing at a time? something to explore. i've often thought how fascinating it would be to experience the female mind. would it be the same? similar? completely opposite? sane but twisted?  my wife is, in many ways, the same as i am: thoughts, feelings, passions...but in some areas we have separate viewpoints, different opinions. sometimes i don't understand at all what she is thinking, why she thinks that way. it requires much discussion to come to understanding. we're good at it, we try to understand as much as we can, but it takes time. i guess that's to be expected, and come to think of it, i haven't really known any men well enough to read their minds and understand their processes either.  does that make me different? foreign? is everyone this way, or does no one really understand anyone else?
