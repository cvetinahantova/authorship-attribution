I don't know where I am heading, except into the light, with fear catapulting me into new confusion and risk.  But with courage, commitment, tenacity, wit, and an everpresent desire to seek the core source of understanding and energy, I will dive deep in those moments of stillness.  I will enact a conscious engagement with the unknown, asking only to know it better, know well its healing power, its limitless love and affection; to know intimately these things is all I ask.  Today I will continue to open my heart to the reality of living in this miracle.
