I wrote this a few months ago.  I lived in the Mojave Desert where it is routinely 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  I hated my job.  All day I stared at a computer until my eyes hurt.  I made far too little money for what my life had become.  Everyone had big plans for me.  I was supposed to be a big star.  I guess, in a way, you could say I did. 	 	My office was near a large retirement community.  My house was next to a hospital.  About once a month, a senior citizen�s fall, or heart attack, or stroke would coincide with my commute.  Because our routes were the same, I became an inadvertent ambulance chaser.  I felt an odd sense of power following these tragedies, the siren blaring, lights flashing, cars pulling to the side of the road like it was all for me.  	Every morning Euphrates and I would go for a jog.  Euphrates was my beagle.  He was in terrific shape.  We loved the mist and cool of the morning, the empty streets,  before any birds started singing,  	Sometimes I pretended that Euphrates and I were the only ones left on earth.  How interesting it would be to go into people�s houses and rummage through their things.  It would be like a yard sale.  I�d look for a nice-fitting suit, Dragnet style.  Just the facts, ma�am.  I�d throw some filet mingon down to Euphrates.  From now on, only the best for my friend.  Of course, all the meat would quickly go bad, all the cows would die and then we would.  We�d have to live on canned tuna in the meantime.  That�s not so bad. 	I never put a leash on Euphrates.  He was well-trained.  Sometimes when we were out running in our post-apocalyptic world, I pretended that Euphrates could talk.  Today was no different. 	�Ready for the jog, E-rate?,� I said to him. 	�Fa sha, Mon,� Euphrates replied.  In my day-dreams, he always spoke like a Rastafarian. 	We passed a large house with a Beemer in the driveway. 	�I�ll bet we be findin some good meats in there,� Euphrates said. 	�That�s a good bet,� I said. 	�An some sweet ViewMastas too,� Euphrates said.  The talking Euphrates was addicted to ViewMasters.  �I be lookin fa tha Sesame Street won.� 	We were barely ten minutes into the run and I was panting heavily.  Euphrates had hardly broken a sweat. 	�How are you in such good shape?� I asked between breaths. 	�It�s da sex, Mon.  I be doin all da sexy bitches,� Euphrates said.  Well, he had me on that one. 	We didn�t find any steaks, or, suits, or ViewMasters, but it was a good run.  We were approaching my house when DeYoung called out to me as he was getting into his car.  DeYoung was a psychiatrist.  I liked him, but came across as a game show host holding a card with all the answers.  I gave Euphrates a glance that told him to keep his mouth shut. 	�Hey, you�re still alive,� DeYoung said.  He startled me.  He must know more about the Apocalypse than I did. 	�Am I not supposed to be?� I asked. 	�I haven�t seen you in quite a while,� DeYoung said. 	We frequently crossed paths in the morning, Euphrates and I returning from our run and DeYoung heading to work.  But recently, Euphrates and I had been casing houses in wealthier neighborhoods. 	�Oh, just decided to try out a different route.� I said. 	�I see,� said DeYoung.  �Well, let Delia know that Robin and I are coming to your party on Friday.  I�m going as Keith Richards and Robin�s going to be Madeline Albright. 	�All right, great,� I said.  �I�ll see you on Friday then.�  I started to jog away.  DeYoung and Robin were incredibly attractive people.  The thought of them dressing as the ugliest people on earth made me laugh.  I wanted Robin more than anything. 	�Later,� DeYoung said as he got into his car.  	�Can you be a dear and pick up some vodka at the store?� Delia said as she prepared food, �We�re running dreadfully low and I desperately need it for the Martinis, Darling.� 	I was in the bathroom putting the final touches on my costume.  Delia was obsessed with themed party nights.  Her past themes have included Over-Dosed Celebrities (I was John Belushi), Accidental Deaths (Sonny Bono), Assassins/Targets (John Lennon), Murderers (Fatty Arbuckle), Rapists/Victims (Mike Tyson), and Talk show Hosts (Chevy Chase). 	Tonight�s theme was Senile/Terminally Ill Celebrities.  I had a tough time deciding who to be.  I�d considered Stephen Hawking and Muhammad Ali, but went with Ronald Reagan. 	I made myself look like death walking.  I was as pale as a Minnesota farm boy. 	�Yeah, I�ll go get it,� I shouted from the bathroom. 	Delia met me as I was entering the living room.  She threw her arms around me and carefully gave me a kiss as to not to mess up my makeup or hers.  She was Queen Elizabeth. 	�Thanks! You�re a doll,� Delia said and ran off to finish whatever she was doing.  I didn�t want to be a doll. I wanted to be a man with Alzheimer's, but I took it as a complement.  Delia had a certain way of speaking.  She watched too many movies growing up.  Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor had a profound influence on her.  Deep down, she wished she was royalty.  She was never pompous, but I always felt like the stable boy.  She was very elegant in all regards, except for her desire to someday make love in a coffin. 	 She admired me as one admires a good song, but we didn�t love each other.  I couldn�t, she reminded me too much of my mother.  I enjoyed being around her.  We had lived together for over a year.  Her family had money.  Her great grandfather had patented a hunting knife with a compass built into the handle.  It was called The Trusty Woodsman.  The Trusty Woodsman paid all our bills. 	As I left, I could hear her chopping in the kitchen.  	On the way to the store, I had a terrible time trying to decide what CD to play. 	�Marley, mon!� Euphrates begged. 	I was fiddling though my CD case, steering with my knees when Euphrates barked, �Watch out!� 	I looked up, jerked the wheel and narrowly missed a Nissan Ultima braking in front of me. 	I tasted bile. 	�You pale as a ghost, Ronnie.� Euphrates said. 	�Very funny.� 	�Dis som good Creedence doe.�  	The grocery store was just a few blocks from our house.  I had to leave Euphrates in the car.  He wants me to pretend I�m blind sometime so he can check the meat out. 	Nothing relaxes me like a trip to the store.  I hunch over the cart and slowly cruise the aisles.  It�s therapy.  Passing rows and rows of boxes, bottles, bags, packages, and containers, I lull myself into a daze.  It�s an out-of-this-world buzz, Euphrates would love it.  The music is usually a Enya/Yanni/John Tesh influx that heightens my hypnotic state.   	On this trip, I was on Cloud 29.  You could have knocked me in the groin with the jawbone of a donkey and I wouldn�t have felt a thing.  On these trips, I try to imagine I�m a petal on a very beautiful flower in the garden of an elderly Japanese man that is planning to go into business with his son-in-law breeding poodles to sell on the Black Market.  It is such a peaceful place to be. 	The Son-in-law was explaining to his father-in-law the principle of the stud when I heard the scream. 	I awoke in the double-wide promotional aisle.  It was near the front of the store and filled with items for the summer: wading pools, floatation devices, lawn chairs, BarBq equipment, suntan lotion, snacks, fireworks, beach balls. 	There were dozens of screams.  Near the cash registers, people scrambled for the doors. 	I rushed to the front of the store.  All the people were scattering from a man in a black trenchcoat.  He was waving a machete above his head. He ran toward a cashier was making for the exit.  She turned around just in time get one last scream out before he hacked her head clean off her neck. 	He stood over her body for a moment.  He stomped in the puddle of blood, jerked his head up, starred right at me. 	I looked around for a weapon, which are in short supply in a grocery store.  He ran right toward me.  I picked up a mini-outdoor BarBQ grill and tossed it at him.  It seemed to slow him down and make him incredibly angry.  I wished that there were more of those on hand.  I began tossing anything I could.    	When you�re placed in a life-or-death situation one of two things happen. 	A.) Survival mode kicks in.  It�a an animalistic, instinctual desire to survive at any cost.  An example would be those that trample other fans to death at English soccer games.  It�s either live or die, in their minds, and they are the ones that live. 	B.) Euphoria sets in.  Dying becomes a surreal experience.  For example, those inebriated drivers that survive car crashes due to their relaxed state. 	Of course, I gave examples where the person lived and that isn�t always the case.  	I was a type B, thanks to the Yanni, that served as a score to the bloodbath.  I was aware I was throwing aprons and spatulas at this crazed man, but it was as if I was watching it on a television screen. 	I watched myself stumble over a sno-cone maker.  I saw the man tower over me.  I watched him swing the sword. 	Then I felt the pain.  And the blood.  Everything was in fast forward mode.  I couldn�t slow it down.  All the noises were extra loud.  I couldn�t focus on any one thing.  It was like sticking my head out the window of a car doing 80 inside a shopping mall.  Images, forms, colors. 	Everything started moving.  I couldn�t hear people�s voices.  The words coming out of peoples mouths didn�t match with who was saying it.  People walked backwards. 	I couldn�t talk.  I ran outdoors.  I felt numb.  Nothing made sense.  Ideas streamed though my mind.  A million contradictions, circular arguments.  Philosophical concepts.  What is good?  What is evil?  I never had an answer.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  From every side.  In a cycle.  Sometimes my eyes were closed, sometimes they were open.  Occasionally I would recognize a voice calling my name.  I�d feel arms around me.  I was trapped. 	I tried to clear my mind to think of a white place.  All white.  No sound.  Nothing.  I just wanted to be at peace.  Then somebody shook me and called my name.  I looked down and blood covered my hands and was steaming down my arms.  I put my hands on my head.  There was blood all over my head. 	I closed my eyes and tried to think about God.  I couldn�t find him.  I couldn�t even remember if he existed.  If my father existed.  Or my mother.  Or me.  I thought that if there was a God, he could make my life appear real.  Then knew how everything really was.  Clarity hit.  I knew it.  I knew freaking everything.  At that point I knew the answer to freaking every question in the universe.  I was the answer.  I always was and would always continue to be.   In a loop.  I didn�t know how long this day had been going on.  I would have guessed at least a few years.  Every event, every thought, every action, every person, every sensation of that afternoon at the store had been placed in a box, shaken up, lined up in a random order and set on repeat. 	I was in limbo.  I�d always been there.  There was nothing solid for me to stand on.  No thought I could claim as an absolute.  I�ve always drifted.  I couldn�t tell if I was in heaven or hell.  I guessed hell, but I wasn�t burning.  But the thought of eternal insecurity terrified me.  But I knew it was too late.  If only I hadn�t went to the store.  It was so funny to me that the grocery store was the gateway to this higher understanding.  It was so ironic, but that thought just circled in my head like all the others.  I got caught in a spiral again trying to figure it all out.  But I knew I had the answer.  I knew what the meaning of it all was.  There was none.  There never was.  If only the others knew.  No, it was good they didn�t.  No one should have to go on as I had to forever.  I didn�t even know if they existed.  No, they couldn�t.  Only I existed. 	Then I was kneeing on the ground.  I was outside of the store.  A policeman had a towel.  �It�s just your cheek,� he said.  He was telling me that everything was going to be ok.  I heard somebody shout something about the roof.  I heard the word �blood� and �ambulance.�  My mind began to clear.  Everything stopped spinning.  I felt my neck.  It was covered in blood.  My hands, my arms.  I afraid to touch my head.  I asked the officer if I should touch my head.  He wouldn�t look at me.  He said I was going to be all right.  I asked him again.  I touched my shoulder.  I couldn�t feel it.  I couldn�t feel any of bones that were supposed to be there.  I couldn�t feel the left side of my head.  The officer wouldn�t look at me.  He kept saying that everything was going to be all right and that only my cheek was cut.  He spoke all his words in a deliberately soothing voice that wasn�t calming me at all.  He yelled at others to come over to help.  They just stood there staring at me with looks of horror. 	�It�s my head, isn�t it?,� I said.  They told me that the man had only glazed my cheek with the blade, but I knew what was going on.  It was that store.  It was cursed.  I was going to die.  I didn�t know how it all had happened, but the crazy man sliced into my head, but I was somehow still conscious after sustaining massive head wounds.  They were all amazed that I was still alive.  They knew it couldn�t last long.  I knew it too.  That�s why officer was so persistent about my cheek, because he didn�t want me to go into shock when I discovered what was really wrong with me.  But I knew.  I could tell by their faces.  It was obvious. 	So I ran.  	I entered at the height of the party. 	�Hey, What�s up?  Wow.  Great costume,� Keith Richards/DeYoung said. 	�Thanks, but it�s not a costume.  It�s real blood and I�m dying.� 	�You�ve outdone yourself this time,� said Johnny Cash. 	�I know, because I�m going to die.� 	�Ha.  Ha.  So what did you use for blood?� said Dick Clark. 	�Human blood from my body.� 	�Oh, you�re a riot.  You crack me up,� the Pope said. 	�I�m not trying to be funny.  I just got chopped up by a machete and I am a very mentally unstable person right now.�  	I spotted Delia. 	�I�m sorry, I forgot the vodka,� I said. 	�Darling, what�s the matter?� 	�I almost died.� 	The party goers noticed something amiss.  They quieted down. 	�And I�ve decided that I hate you.� 	She started to cry. 	�I�m going to pack up and leave now.�	 	I went into the bedroom and threw some clothes in a backpack.  I walked back into the living room.  Delia was on the coach weeping. She was being comforted by sicky-looking people.  Everyone looked confused. 	�I hope you all choke and die,� I said and left. 	 	I had left the car in the grocery store lot.  When I got back there, Euphrates was still sitting in the passenger�s seat.  He looked up at me.  He was holding a ViewMaster to his eyes.   	�Was happenin?� he said. 	I explained everything. 	�Reely?  I dinna see a thin.� 	�Well, anyways, I was almost killed.� 	�Das a bummer, mon,� Euphrates said, then went back to his ViewMaster. 	I needed to get out of the desert.  Fast.  I saw an officer walking toward me.  I started up the car and took off. 	 	My face hurt like hell.  I needed to get it looked at.  I ripped a strip off a brown paper bag and stuck it to my cheek.  	I began to hate Euphrates.  He was still in the passenger seat, enthralled with his ViewMaster.  What about me?  What about my problems? 	�I�m dying here, man.  Put the ViewMaster down.  Pay attention to me,� I yelled at him. 	He moved the ViewMaster a little ways from his face and turned to me. 	�Wa, mon.  juss needa chill fa a while.� 	I nodded. 	�An why ya gotta be knockin my ViewMasta like dat?� 	 	�I know of more ways to make someone suffer than most people on this planet,� the six year old girl told me. 	I wanted to leave.  But I knew was in this doctor�s office for something. 	My face hurt. 	Oh. 	I had to get the hole in my cheek looked at.  	I was sure I could peek my tongue through it if I had wanted to.  The torn piece of brown paper bag still stuck to the wound, like it was a flannelgraph.  I hunched over in my chair and stared at the dull waiting room carpet.  I was out of breath and sweating.  My clothes were spotted with blood. 	�I�ve been to torture museums,� the girl said, �I like seeing all the old weapons and devices.� 	Her mother smiled at me and adjusted a pink bow in the girl�s hair. 	�You remind me of my ex-girlfriend,� I told the girl.  She looked confused.  I couldn�t tell if it was because of my slurred speech or what I had said.  Her mother kept smiling at me.  I was never sure if the mom could talk or not.  I knew her daughter could though. 	�So, you must like that stuff, huh?� the girl said, pointing at a bottle I was clutching in my left hand. 	I looked down and realized I was crushing the life out of a plastic bottle of Red Eye BarBq sauce. 	�Oh this?� I dropped the bottle to the floor. �It�s ok.� 	�Sir, we can see you now,� a frightened nurse called out to me. 	A few of my misconceptions were vanquished that day.  I discovered that nurses sometimes do look afraid.  Also, you don�t always have to wait a long time in a doctor�s office.  That is, if you make a big enough commotion and bleed on enough people.  It also helps if you do all this in the office of a children�s doctor.  	I didn�t know where I was going and I didn�t care.  Hit the road, driving blind, hand on the wheel is like nothing else.  I love the lines the strripes.  the yellow the white, the asphalt, the reflectors, the signs, the exits, all for me.  No cares no cares no cares.  a dog, my friend , at  mind side.  what else do i need.  it was afternoon to evening to night  and dark.  it was so dark.  I was blind to so many things, yet alive, yes still avile and free.  i was new, reborn.  and the desert was no longer me.  i was free.
