How do I get into the printer ink business?!  Talk about a gold mine (no pun intended)!  As I read through the article, I couldn't help but get a little steamed.  My printer ALWAYS runs out of ink at the most inconvenient times.  Right when that big report is due or right when you have finally gotten the data EXACTLY like you want it....boom.  No ink!  Then to think I have to go out and spend 28 dollars to replace the stupid thing.  Not to mention that I have bought the wrong cartridges before because of one little letter on the code (ex. 45A as opposed to 45).  I can't believe that people pay more for ink cartridges than they do printers!  It's almost better to go buy a new printer everytime you need ink.  It sure might be cheaper.  As I think about printer ink companies, it makes me think of brick manufacturers.  There are only 2 brick companies in the United States.  If you want bricks, you pay for them and have to wait 6 months to get them.  If ink companies continue to monopolize the industry, we will soon be on a waiting list at the local Staples to purchase printer ink!  BC
