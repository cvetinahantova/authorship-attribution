it seems like we complain about our privacy a lot. i mean, on the internet, there's always some asshole sending spam. you've got stalkers, you've got newscrews and journalists, and then you've got...  ...hey, who the hell is that plugging a TUBE UP MY NOSE!?  yes, as a matter of fact, there's a guy that looks at the insides of your nose. at least in japan. i mean, you've got doctors for your eyes, doctors for your skin, doctors that look at your insides, and fix stuff, you've got doctors to see if you have a mental problem, so logically, there has to be a doctor that looks at your nose. ugh.   my grandparents a couple days back kept complaining that i kept blowing my nose and that something was wrong with me. hell, i just said that, look, my nose was fine, thank-you-very-much. but after beign sick for a few days, they thought that they should have a specialist look at my nose. great. so yesterday, i went to this nose clinic and what-not to see a nasatologist, i guess, to get my nose checked up. the whole idea was freaky. and i thought going to the dentists sucked.  you know, the whole idea freaks me out. a guy looking right inside of your nose. NASTY! not right. i can't handle it! and then what he does is stick a tube up my nose and starts flooding water... saltwater, mind, into my system. great. so now the guy wants to drown me. perfect! like, yeah, i wanted to be suicidal and had a death-wish and what not. disgusting. doctors... they think of everything to stick stuff into you: tongue depressers, tubes in your throat, and now they want to stick stuff up your nose. great. i think we've redefined "invasion of privacy." NASTY!
