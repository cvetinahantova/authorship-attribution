The sky is unbelievable today - it's like nuclear fallout.  The sun is just a faint red ball and the smoke is incredibly thick.  We're trying to keep the doors shut but it just filters in through the cracks.   I have a headache and it's so hard to sleep at night. Ugh.  I am feeling stressed because I have to get this huge workshop organized for teachers next week.  I am trying to spend time helping my mom pack up stuff, get the handouts photocopied and into binders, and still live a normal life for my kids.  Today we spent all afternoon locked up in a friend's basement, stuffing handouts into binders.  Three friends were able to come and help me.  It was so hot and stuffy in there.  I have about 25 big boxes of finished binders ready for the workshop next week.  I'm going to drop them off at the school where the workshop will take place but I'm a little worried that we may end up being evacuated and have to move them out again.
