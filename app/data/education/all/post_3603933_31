My life is never again to be the same.  Our new puppy arrived!!  I picked her up from the Flint airport this morning.  She came in a nice little travel case and seemed to adjust to Kyle and I just fine!  She was great on the car ride home and we have been playing with her all afternoon.  I think we tired her out a bit because she is curled up in my lap asleep right now.  I will post pictures tonight - she really is the cutest thing ever!   Her name is Iri.
