In other exciting Eric news.. He's been standing on his own these last few days.  The first time it was an accident. He was holding and empty water bottle in his hand and put his other hand on it, then he had this Wyle E. Coyote moment where he realized he was standing on his own and fell WHAM on his butt. I swear if he could have whipped out a sign that said "Uh Oh" he would have.  He's standing more and more, and Rich said he took a step yesterday too. It's just so amazing.  Big birthday bash for him coming up on the last Sunday in August.  It should be fun.
