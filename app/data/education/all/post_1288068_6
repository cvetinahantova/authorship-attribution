Attn: Friends, family, lovers, children of PGCEers   It is too much. There is too much to do and too little time to do it in.  We are tired and cranky.  We haven't stopped since September.  Children shout at us all day and we shout at them and then we shout at you.  We are incapable of thinking of anything except Fuckarses of Standards and KS3 essays and WHAT IS A CEDP ANYWAY?!  We are sorry and we love and need you all if we are going to get to the end.  It is nearly over. We will all be back to normal soon, I promise.  We might even say or do nice things and not talk about teaching for a day or two.  Kisses and apologies in advance. x
