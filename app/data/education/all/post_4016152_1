I'm slowly becoming a lazy New Yorker.  This week, after much convincing by my classmates and the ads in the subway, I decided to order my groceries online.  The last time that I did grocery shopping, the fruit was old, the cheese was molded, and I was fed up.  A friend told me that if you order from  urlLink Fresh Direct , the produce and other products are guaranteed to be of good quality.  At first I thought it would be ridiculously priced, but the delivery fee was only 4.95 and most of the products cost about the same as what I would have paid at a supermarket here.  Plus, since my main transportation is the heel-toe express, it saved me carrying my goods for a half mile in the summer heat and humidity.  Needless to say, I am very happy with my online shopping experience.   However, if I start paying for other people to do my laundry, I won't be able to look myself in the eye anymore. That's too far.
