Sweet melodies    urlLink Tracy  got me a CD of  Blackmore's Night . So many memories... most of them happy. Things are starting to turn for the better here. I only dread the phonecall from... a certain person. I admit, I still don't get along with my family. Sure, I still love them - they  are  my family after all - but I know that when I talk to them I will lash out again at the worst moment. I completely lost all patience with them, which is why I don't want to talk to them. At the moment, no communication is the best communication. In that sense it makes me happy that my phone is not working properly...
