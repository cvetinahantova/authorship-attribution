today, when i wanted to blog on my livejournal account, my account was somehow not found, and i couldn't sign in.. stupid livejournal.. all those times i wrote journals, all deleted.. sucks..  well today's kinda boring.. going to jb later.. haha, i think i know why it feels boring.. i'm not with her.. been so for the past few days, and i really miss her, and i want to hold her hands.. damn, i sound mushy..  well, also partly cause of Fairmont's song.. a line in the song, "Everyone, everywhere is having fun, then there's me.." haha..  got down a few lines for a new song last night.. "Monday seems so far away,  the day that i will see you next..  The day that you'll be here to stay,  Monday seems so far away.." got part of the music too, vaguely..  listening to Thrice now, "to awake and avenge the dead", power song!!  I MISS SHAZLEEN!! and its killing me.. arrgh.....
