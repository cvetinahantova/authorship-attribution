I was five years old when I last saw my parents. Their faces are no longer with me. The passage of time means that they are but blurred shadows now, dancing in the edges of my sight. My father. My mother. Lost to me. When I was a little girl, they called me Chihiro-chan.  I was their youngest, their miracle. My mother was an old woman, I'm told. I don't remember her age. I don't remember. I have a sudden attack of doubt. Perhaps it is wrong of me to be speaking out so. Perhaps I should retreat back into the Flower and Willow world, and keep my silence.  But my world now is dying: what is there to lose by sharing my life.  When I am gone, this will be the only part of me to live on.
