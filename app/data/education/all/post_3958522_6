For the sake of discussion, what are your thoughts about keeping your group open to those God sends you.  House churches tend to be very inward, which is quite a liability in the Kingdom.  In fact, I helped create that habit with the whole CLIQUE thing.  But as we've said before, if you close your group off then you may be working against God, and you're really not a church.  I believe we will see all sorts of people drawn to these. . . probably drawn by God.  How do you expect to accomodate those he sends to you?  How does someone become part of your family?  I suppose it's like a bunch of orphans adopted into a loving home.     Example: so lets say a small group of you were adopted a long time ago.  Luckily, over time, you've been drawn into a very loving family with your adopted siblings and loving father.  So you get comfortable.  All of the sudden . . . your adopted fathered ushers another child into the home, perhaps several.  As a bunch of siblings, once orphaned, later adopted into a new family, how will you respond to the new kids God has brought into his home?  Be mindful of the parable of sower in Matthew 13.
