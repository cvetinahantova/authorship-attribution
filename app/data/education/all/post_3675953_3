This song is sung by one of my most favorite rock bands and “his” favorite too, Linkin Park. It’s about breaking away from something that you have been loving obsessing about because it hurts you so much, resistance is futile and no matter how much you say that you can fight for it, you no longer can.   When I took a quiz on the net, the results said that this song is for the one I love, or let’s call him my ex-ai. It’s also a coincidence that this band is also my ex-ai’s favorite. I find this song appropriate because the band clearly expressed the pain and confusion when you have to let go of something you found to be part of your “daily dose”, when you have to “break away from the habit”.  I am not a drug addict, but the way I have been obsessing about my ex-ai is like a woman hooked on marijuana and heroine since her childhood years.  I’m not exaggerating, I guess it’s just like that when you’re in love with someone who treats you like another stranger in their life… you keep on being rejected, the stronger is the surge to get him. At first, it was just your normal dose then as days go by, the drive increases until it becomes a habit which eventually turns into addiction. Of course it hurts to have all my love be fixated exclusively for one person only, but who cares? Even if I’m being called brainless despite my high IQ, I really don’t care… the only thing I care about is I see my ex-ai and talk to him, which I always thought would turn out be something more serious than that.        Memories consume Like opening the wounds I’m picking me apart again You all assume I’m safe here in my room Unless I try to start again  The first stanza, oh yes… it’s all about the memories and the pain and the façade. The whole entourage is here. I tried to forget him, really I did. I have collected all the things I have which remind me of him and ask my best friend to keep it. I have written him a six-page long letter on how I fell for him, love him and eventually hate myself for loving him, but that letter was just kept in my drawer, and I always read it that’s why memories always come back to haunt me. Whenever I see him it all comes back, the times when he tried to make friends with me, when my friend told me that he liked me when I was still a freshman in high school, when he smiles at me and when he fools around with me. All these memories and so much more are just ripping me apart into pieces. It hurts me so much just to think about him. I tell my friends that I don’t care a bit about him but the truth us just I put on a brave face so that they won’t know how foolish I am when it comes to love. They all think that I have moved on because I am now diverting my attention to other guys, but the truth is… it’s all just an act. When I’m alone though you think I’m alright, I’ll never be alright.             I don’t want to be the one The battles always choose Cause inside I realize That I’m the one confused  Now we have the refrain, yes I am confused. I don’t know how the heck I got myself in this position but I’m here so there’s no turning back. At this point, though I am going into another phase in my life, I can’t seem to let go of that past which clings tightly unto me, but a part of me says that I have to, for my own good.  I feel so torn between the mixed feelings I have. It’s driving me crazy up to the point I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing. I don’t want to be put in this kind of situation but it is fate that chose that I have to deal with this and while I’m at it, fate decided to give me a taste of hell.   Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more that anytime before I have no options left again  Before I proceed to the chorus, let’s go to the second line first. I have a cure, or at least a temporary one. It’s redirecting my attention to other guys who I see, which end up being temporary diversion only. But the more I try to deny all the feelings I have inside and the more I try to use my cure, the greater is the pain. I just end up comparing the guys I meet to him and I just give any guy who comes near me a nil chance which seems really unfair.  And now I am stuck with no alternative, I can’t cure it. But I realized something that the reason I can’t cure it is because I am afraid of losing him in my heart. The pain became a part of me that I no longer can let go of it. It’s like the pain is what I live for and it shadows all the sense left in me. It sounds weird but now I realize it.  I don’t know what’s worth fighting for Or why I have to scream?? I don’t know why I instigate, And say what I don’t mean I don’t know how I got this way I know it’s not alright So, I’m breaking the habit I’m breaking the habit Tonight…  The chorus, the most hard-hitting words in the song are here. Yes, I have no idea what I am fighting for, if it is the love I feel or the obsession to experience the feeling of having someone love me which I lost in him. I don’t know why I want to hurt to myself for one person who does not know me deeply. I don’t know why I keep on doing this to myself. Maybe because the feeling of regret and pain clouded my sanity to the point that I don’t know what to do with all the emotions I feel. I don’t know why I say some things that I know in my heart I don’t mean. Like when I say that I am okay when I am not, when I said that I don’t like him when I do. That’s when I realized that these feelings cannot be denied because the more I do that the harder it is for me to overcome all the pain. There is no other way that to face the worst pain I ever encountered so far and while I’m facing it, I have to let go of the source of the pain though I find myself at a certain point that its hard to break away from the habit, the habit of seeing and having mixed emotions when I see him, reality came crashing down that I just need to say adios to the habit of him…       I’ll paint it on the walls Coz I’m the one at fault I’ll never fight again And this is how it ends  	Yes, as sang by Linkin Park at the Coda, I am the one at fault. These things would never have happened if only I had been more careful about the feelings I give to others. These things would never have occurred if only I had not fought the feelings I suppressed when he used to like me. I would never have to go through all these if only I had been more open-minded to the things that could possibly be. I would never have to stick to the feeling of pain if only I had to learn to let go of it beforehand. And most of all, I would have never written this if only I had decided to break away from him before he became someone that I would find myself hard to live without though he only causes me pain. All these could have been avoided if only I stopped myself from hurting my feelings and stopped liking and loving him completely. So, yes, it is my fault and I am trying my best to make up for that mistake.     I don’t know what’s worth fighting for Or why I have to scream?? But now I have some clarity To show you what I mean I don’t know how I got this way I’ll never be alright So, I’m breaking the habit I’m breaking the habit Tonight    	This is the last chorus, the last few lines in the song. I am trying to break away from the habit, though it’s hard to do, I am doing my best and I hope it is good enough. I can never be TOTALLY ALRIGHT because he has inflicted serious wounds here in my heart. But I realized that I can’t exactly dwell on these feelings forever because it’s not healthy for me or the people around me. I can’t let people wait for me to be completely happy because for the longest time they had exerted effort for me to be close to him or give me chances, but I guess I and my ex-ai will never be… our fates are not intertwined with each other. But who knows?  Maybe in the future we will meet again and maybe when we see each other he will no longer be a habit, but just a memory that I can live without. But I know, deep inside my heart he will always and forever be a part of me that I never can completely let go of.
