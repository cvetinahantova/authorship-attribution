Well folks, I will be offline for a while, starting soon. I dropped the laptop (well, I didn't  drop  it, I put it on the couch and it fell off it because I was stupid enough to put it too close to the edge, so one way or another it's my fault) and now it is only running on battery, because the connector where the power supply gets plugged into is all jiggly and sparky (and not in a good way). I got about 2 hours of battery life left, and I figured I'll save those for when I need them. It sucks, but I'll have to live with it until it gets fixed.
