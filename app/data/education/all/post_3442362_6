We watched Children of the Corn with Emilie which was a very bad idea cuz that's a truly gory film  (the 1984 version).  I think we had confused it with something else maybe.  So we are very bad, horrible parents.  But the problem was, we had really hyped it up.  Looked everywhere we went to buy it.  (Really it was Trevor, not me.  I had only a very very tiny insignificant miniscule part in it all.)  So when we finally broke down and rented it, and noticed it was rated R, what were we to do?  Tell her never mind?  So she saw it.  And will probably have nightmares forever.  And will never view corn in quite the same way.   That Malachai is one BAD boy.  And that Isaac is a FREAK show!!  Those eyes, that face, that VOICE.  My absolute favorite part is when Isaac blasts up into the sky, sparks flying, from the makeshift corn stalk crucifix.  Followed closely only by the scene where Burt and Vicky discover corn stuffed into every nook and cranny of the chevy convertible (i don't know the model...Trev will get with you on that one).  Those kids musta been GT!!!   Suffice it to say that Em spent the night in the middle of our bed.  (That was a first since we got the KING size and i must say that i barely noticed her presence.)  You gotta see this movie again though.  It's pretty funny and still a little scary.   "MALACHIA, he wants you TOOOOOO"
