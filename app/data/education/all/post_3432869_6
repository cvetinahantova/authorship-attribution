After weeks of hearing that we would receive our placements, "soon" I think it's finally true.  Oh, the agony of hearing we would know by "mid-may" and then hearing "by the first week in June" and then hearing from the JETs in other interview locations who have received their placements!!!  But finally, we have heard official news from Douglas Bell in Chicago that our placements are being mailed by snail mail either today or tomorrow.  That means by Wednesday or Thursday I will know more about what the next year of my life will be like.   Will I be up to my neck in snow again or will I be lounging on the beaches in my free time?  Will I live in the land of monkeys who bathe in the hot springs like on the Discovery Channel??  I've never been so anxious to check the mailbox repeatedly, day in and day out!  I'm awaiting not only my placement, but my new Dell Laptop Latitude D505, and my books "Learning to Bow," "Let's Learn Hiragana," and "Let's Learn Katakana."  Hey Mr. Postman look and see, if there's a letter in your bag for me?!  Deliver the letter, the sooner the better."
