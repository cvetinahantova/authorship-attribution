Parents:   I'm taking off to Myrtle Beach for the week with the family.  However, I'll try to access the net as often as I can, so maybe you'll hear more from me.   I looks like the first house church has already taken place.  Aaron and a handful of others gathered last week.      Aaron:  it would be cool if you could share about the evening (i.e. who was there, what happened, what you learned).  That would be so helpful to everyone else.  We're all learning here.   Matt and Lou will be starting their's this weekend.  It seems they've decided to wrap their house church around preparing a meal together, instead of just providing them.      Matt and Lou:  share with everyone your reasoning behind that.   JP and Wendy should starting theirs very soon.   Its important that these first three house churches to be rather established by the end of the month.  August 14th the freshman are arriving, and the next night is our first "REUNION".  Add all the other Shackers returning to town, there will be a lot of people looking to belong to a family.  Therefore, over the next few weeks try to find your groove (i.e. meeting time, core group and spiritual habits of the community).
