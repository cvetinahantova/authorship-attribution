i'm beginning to think i'll actually survive this semester... what a revelation! =P  now that i've started my lie groups final, it's slow going, but i'm finding, if i just keep at it, it's doable... that's incredibly affirming... 2 problems down, 4 to go... and the last problem is even what i did a talk on on monday, which is also a very good thing!  graph theory's another story, but i'm working on it with sarah (2nd year student) all tomorrow afternoon... so if nothing else, at least we can gripe about it together. =P  2nd to last friends episode ever, then back to work.
