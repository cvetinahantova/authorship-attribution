I carry this case around campus this year -- it's two toned, orange and tan and was probably produced in 1955 or thereabouts.  It effectively functions as my "briefcase" (a term / idea / object that doesn't really "turn my crank" -- I swore I'd never carry one)...which is great because it's much larger than any "briefcase" i've ever seen...so i can replicate the chaos/hope/&possibility with which my desk is replete --  (or... "it's messy inside my briefcase like it is on my desk.")  But what's interesting to me is that I get all these comments about it from other faculty.   "You got a record player in there?"  "Bringing your trumpet to class?"  "Mmmm." (with a shaking head -- Julia eventually told me that her dad carried an identical case when he travelled -- and filled it with his hard liquor)  "You look like some kind of salesman."   "What *is* that?"  I love the idea that the objects and relations of a person's everyday self could act as a sort of stimuli for questions....  My mom always said that I was confused about the point of clothes; that I was under the impression that clothes were costumes.    Well, she was at least right about the second part.  I certainly think that clothes are costumes.    For everybody, though, I think they are.  I just happen to think the character I'm playing should probably be a little more quirky than the rest of the cast...  peace~
