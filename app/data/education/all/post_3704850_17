OK, guys, here is our new tool to allow us to communicate about some of the details of our project.  It will hopefully serve as a record of some of the things that we've done and a place to ask questions.  So if you do something that other people should know about, like creating a new style in a shared stylesheet or writing a new PHP function that might be helpful for others, post a note on it here.  If we need to schedule a meeting, I'll put a reminder here.  If you've got a question, you can ask it here.  If you just find a really cool/funny/well designed website, you can post it here.  If you're lonely on a Friday night and need a place to talk...well, don't use this blog, that's kinda depressing.  But anyway, you get the picture.  Have fun.
