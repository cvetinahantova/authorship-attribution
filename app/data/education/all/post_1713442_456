urlLink Identification and Recruitment of Migrant Students: Strategies and Resources. ERIC Digest.    This ERIC Digest is by Melecio, Ray and Hanley, Thomas J.  It examines methods for helping migrant students learn.  From the ERIC Digest:  The first step for the recruiter is to develop a picture of the region's agriculture, processing, and fishing industries to facilitate the search for migrant children. There are many sources for this information:    Department of Agriculture. Provides current information on land use, types of crops grown and processed, future harvesting trends, crop expansion (or reduction), and more.    State Department of Labor (DOL). Provides information on the whereabouts of farm labor. When farmers use more than a certain number of farm laborers, they are required by law to report this information to the DOL. A list of such farms can be obtained.    Cooperative Extension Programs. Provide information on a variety of farm-related issues through county extension agents who visit local farms and through key contacts at land grant colleges and universities. Agriculture faculty at these institutions often can provide valuable insights on changing harvesting trends, use of labor, mechanization of crops, and the human and political implications of these changes.    Other Regulatory Agencies. Provide information on regulations they monitor. For example, knowing the state's regulations regarding housing can facilitate finding eligible families by providing answers to questions such as "Is housing provided by the farmer?" or "Is housing adequate for families or for single men?"
