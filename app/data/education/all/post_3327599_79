ok so apparently if i'm gonna talk about someone i need to learn how to spell *cough Chris Elliott cough*.. i hope everyone is happy now.  today was pretty slow.. i cleaned.. but i went out and that made it all better. as of yesterday Phil and i have been dating for one month. yay. i know i'm excited considering it's hard for me to find someone who's willing to spend that much time with me lol. and he's mostly sane.. we went out for chinese and then went to see a movie (Godsend). and for those of you who have little faith in me.. i did watch it, all of it! it was ok, it was supposed to be scary but it wasn't. i'm not sure the guy next to us heard any of the movie.. maybe i'm just easily distracted but his rubbing his wind pants got pretty annoying..  there's a black cat in my kitchen looking at me.. when did we get a black cat?
