Well, tonight I decided to go to a jewelry party hosted by my sorors.  That was rather fun and it felt good to get out--even though I was DOG tired before going--I think I should do it more often.      I feel like I'm nowhere near done with the stuff in my classroom that I want to get done...but I have a friend coming to help me put some stuff up tomorrow, so that should move it along;)        My AP keeps coming on to me; it's kinda weird.  It's not that I feel threatened by him, it's just uncomfortable--not enough for me to report him or anything, though.  I guess it's harmless as long as he doesn't actually cross the boundaries--I'd never wanna get a black man in trouble for something trivial (too many of 'em are getting in trouble for the serious stuff!)      I think I'm gonna chill at home tomorrow and watch movies.  I plan to enjoy myself (remember how I'm starting to enjoy the existing moments?!:))        Well, kinda short winded tonight 'cause I'm sleepy--I will write some more in the morning...when I should probably be doing some work on my room-LOL!
