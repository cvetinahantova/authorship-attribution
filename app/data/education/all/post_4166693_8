Ohhhh.....my office supplies showed up today! Hooray, hooray! I was so excited. I didn't get the really awesome desk organizer because we're supposed to be getting those when we move to the new Student Union in October. Aside from that, I got everything I wanted. My tape dispenser came in in "putty" which is a blah off-white instead of black like I requested, but I think I might Sharpie it to make it pretty...or putt fabric on it....ohhhh....I might do that! I think I will.  Last day with the freshmen was today. No more "orientation week" activities. I'm a little sad, but I'm glad not to be on my feet in heels for 4 hours straight. That's always nice.  Tonight is laundry night! The only reason I am really excited is that I need the panties desperately. I'm almost out! Ewwww......  Tonight is also easy dinner night. I am either making R. take me out for dinner or we are making sammiches.  Hmmm.....I'm a little sammiched out. Let me explain....  The last three days I have had freshman orientation seminars. All three days they have provided lunch. All three days that "lunch" has been the same sub sammiches from Wal-Mart. Tasty the first day; not so tasty the second day; disappointing the third day. Maybe dinner out would be a good thing for me.  Classes start tomorrow. Hooooo-raaaay!
