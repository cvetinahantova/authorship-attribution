Mood: Calm   Listening To: Nothing, a bit late for it..   Ah, what a very mixed and weird day.  Not totally out of the ordinary though. I woke up, past midday and got myself a pint of tea (yeah, in a pint glass, Im wasnt feeling too hungry) Then went straight on the computer, something I must get out of the habit of doing, I end up wasting far too much time.  I went about starting some ICT Revision for my test on Monday, things looks good, though I need to settle some definate pieces, which I will try to do tomorrow. Speaking of which I plan to try and do as much science work as possible. Which reminds me of the RE I need to finish for Wednesday. Oh, the joy of revision.  Did some running today, times of 8.28 and 6.32-ish non-stop jogging which isnt too bad, I need to keep it up though, Also measured myself again and I seem to be losing some inches around the upperbody which isnt too bad, that or the fact i used string instead of the metal tape to measure may have something to do with it.  Really need to get some work done.  Ah, reminds me that my dad promised to get me a laptop if i got 6 A*'s.....Not sure If I can do it, I'll analyse some of what tests I'll be doing below...   Maths - Could  get an A*...A otherwise  Bio -Could get an A* for all of them....A for all though  Chem -A  Physics -A  Eng Lang -....Could get an A*...Maybe an A  Eng Lit -A Hopefully.
