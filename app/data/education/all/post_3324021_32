Hard to believe we are already working on homecoming procedures already! I was not at the first homecoming meeting, but I have contacted the class president, vice-president, and secretary, and have requested the dates of any upcoming events so I can post them here for you. Through several talks I have found out that are theme is Super Mario Bros. but that is all I know at this point.
