Little Chinchillas are fabulous!!!  They are sweet and soft and squishy and just love to hop around like like baby kangaroos.  Who wouldn't want such a wonderful and entertaining pet?   ...... ..... ............ I just can't answer that b/c nobody in their right mind would turn down such a lovely animal. But he has.  He changed his mind.  I am crushed b/c it means that I have to give him away.  Hopefully some small lonely child will want him.  A child who can take care of him and feed him and and not kill him.   The best part was that I would get to have him back when I got back...  If anyone knows of someone who would love to have a fantastic little chinchilla named Winston.... let me know.
