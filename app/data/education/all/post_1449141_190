Kucinich (D-OH), leader of the opposition to the war in Iraq in the House, will hold a news conference tomorrow, June 4th, at noon on the Cannon Terrace to announce that he will use a Resolution of Inquiry to demand the release of the intelligence that led to the war in Iraq.   "This Administration led this nation into war based on lies," stated Kucinich. "I think that this Congress, and the American people, have a right to know what information this Administration had, and how they justify their public comments. Now is the time for truth telling."   At tomorrow's news conference Kucinich will announce that he will introduce a Resolution of Inquiry to demand the release of intelligence, to Congress, that the Administration used to justify their claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.   A Resolution of Inquiry is a rarely used House procedure that Kucinich used successfully in March to get the Administration to release the 12,000 page weapons report that Iraq had submitted to the UN.   The news conference will take place at 12pm on Wednesday, June 4th, at the Cannon Terrace. (Rain Room: HC-6, Capitol).
