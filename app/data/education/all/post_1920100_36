"Girl's Night Update" Well last night I invited a couple girls to come hang out at my house. I really enjoyed the fellowship. It was a lot of fun. We ate a lot of junk food, pizza, and played games. We also had good conversations. I thank God for times like these because sometimes we get so caught up in our busy life that we don't make time to hang out.  Well tonight I am going to play broomball for the first time! Let's see if I will survive. hehehe =) The whole college group is suppose to show up at the hockey ring at 10p. I am anxious because I have never done this before. Everyone says its really fun.  For now I am heading out to my brother's house for the day.  Please keep my friend Karla in prayer yesterday she got laid off and she has a wedding comming up soon.
