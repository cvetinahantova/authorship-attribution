I've been at a local theme park today where I did absolutely sweet F.A. except sit in a cafe writing one of my books. It was sooo dull, although I did get to see some very cute animals (including an adorable litter of kittens) and I got my face painted. Tomorrow we're off to Birmingham, which means I have to get up at 5am, so you'll forgive me for making this posting short. I have another job interview on Thursday. I'm feeling very hopeful for this one but I am quite concerned that it might be a maternity contract. We shall have to see.Â  Did email the person who's set this interview up, but she must have gone home.
