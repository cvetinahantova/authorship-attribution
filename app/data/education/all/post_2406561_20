Can't stop fighting the feeling.  So mixed up inside.  Why?  1. Francisco called me today.  2. George told Guria he thought I was hot.  3. I can't stop picking fights with Efrain.  4. Matt gives me leering looks all the time in French and Pre-Calculus.  5. I want to flirt so badly with Adrian.  6. Same goes for Caleb, but only because Diana has a thing for him.  Die Cheermerlyn. Die.
