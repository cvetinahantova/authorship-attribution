Ah, how the lazy have fallen.  LOL.  I have been busy, and classes are no help.  Iwanted things to slow down, so I can make better use of my time, and not waste any.  Well, as you can see, January 18th was my last entry.  I've failed myself, but I havn't given up.  I have a photography assignemnt to finish, and some other ish to made due wit.  Tried a new game, Beyond Good and Evil for Gamecube.  Normaly I hate adventure games, but I like this one.  I get all confused, and lost.  It does make me think a lot.  LOL
