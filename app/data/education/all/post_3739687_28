hello,  well this has to be a quick message because i'm running late.  i've been helping out with sewing again today.  first graders with needles!  i think that is all that needs to be said.  surprisingly they haven't taken one another's eyes out.  yet.   anyway...  i also had the first grade for reading class which went very well because it was all about magic.  they loved it.  actually, school has been great today because sister erlinda is  busy with parent meetings.  when the cats away!  so i took a two hour lunch with a few other folks.  on fiday the school is moving into new facilities.  it's going to be anarchy.  nothing ever works as planned in thailand especially at st. joe.  i'm looking forward to the chaos.  i just hope i don't get hurt in all the running around.  gotta run. jane
