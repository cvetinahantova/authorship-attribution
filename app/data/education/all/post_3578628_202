(Great Nirvana tune) I guess I didn't expect people to want to see me at PSI.  Well I did, but I decided to not go because I am having teeth pulled out on Tuesday and will be missing three days of band and I won't be marching in the game (at least right now I am not expecting to be feeling up to it).  So I thought it was important that I go even if I didn't want to.  OF COURSE I did think today how much more fun it would've been to be at Riley.  Oh well, I hope to see everyone at my house tommorow night. Sorry I didn't show up Ambur and see ya later.
