So whatthafuck? I'm seriously dying. There's a crapload of work to be done by tomorrow, and I'm sitting here, mourning over the lost of my sanity. I mean, what normal person sits there, thinking 24/7 about the guy that they're in lust with? Well, not necessarily lust, because I honestly feel like it's turning into love or something. My body is so tensed up right. I feel sick to my stomach.  To make matters worse, my effin' aunt is coming over today with her bratty kids. Screams head off. No damnit. Cause then we have to play nicey, and stuff, and my dad is already effin' pissed after last night's screamfest with my mom. Just great. I hate this. I hate my life. I feel like dying all the time nowadays. I want to cry, but I can't seem to cry anymore. It's like my heart has turned into ice. I guess people are right. Ice runs through my veins, because I'm such a bloody bitch. Cold-hearted. Selfish. Everything that personifies evil is me.   I can't focus. I seriously feel like I've written a crappy research paper. It sucks like a mofo. And.. I'm supposed to be the writer person, or whatever. I hate it when I feel like my work is utter crap. It makes me feel low, and it sucks beyond belief.   I FREAKING HATE EVERYTHING. I'M SO SORRY THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH EFRAIN. I'M SORRY THAT I CAN EVEN SAY THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM. I HATE THE WAY HIS SMILE LIGHTS UP HIS FACE. I HATE THAT HE MAKES ME LAUGH AT THE SLIGHTEST JOKE. I HATE THAT HE'S DIFFERENT. I HATE THAT FLIRTS WITH GIRLS AS MUCH AS I DO WITH GUYS. I HATE THE WAY HIS HAIR GETS POOFY, AND MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE A LITTLE KID. I HATE THAT HE GETS SAD WHEN I DON'T TALK TO HIM EVERYDAY. I HATE THAT THINGS ARE WEIRD BETWEEN US. I HATE THAT FACT THAT I LOVE HIM.  I HATE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME, BUT I DON'T LIKE THEM BACK. I HATE THAT EFRAIN WAS MY BEST MALE FRIEND, AND THAT I LOVE HIM.   I just to curl  up and die.
