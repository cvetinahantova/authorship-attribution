Feigning Interest       Yah, another one of my complaints again. But this one is valid and a good one. Yes because I find it weird that I run into people like this all too often, and only wish they would grow up and become the college students that they should be.  I agree age is just a number, but by the time you hit a certain time of your life, possibly when you are a sophomore in college or something, you should start acting and thinking a bit more maturly, and making wise decisions.  Possibly, this would mean becoming less absorbed in your stuff and actively showing interest when you talk to others.  Well here's what I see these days.  I know too many people in college, they all want to talk to you,so you start talking (this isn't specifically talking about me--as I observe it a lot!), but yah they want to talk to you and ask you all these questions, yet at the same time their mind is off somewhere else. How do I know this? Well whatever I tell them, they'll ask me about it 2 minutes later! Hmm..where was their mind when I told them?    I see this problem as two-fold. One, that these people are just very immature, and really dont care about what you have to say, or Two, that these people just used you so that they could rattle their problems in front of you once you babbled your mind out and spoke of all the stuff bugging you.  Now, if number two is the truth behind all this, then we have an even worse problem, because there isn't really much communication going on hence making the communicators even worse off than just being a bit less mature.      I don't know, but I see people talking, going "yah" "yah" "oh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaah" and then they ask you stuff that you already told them! Hmm....could it only be because I talk boring, or because this world is just becoming too bland!!   Hmm...I know I am a bit all over the place...really shows the state of my mind these days....
