Having watched England lose on penalties and with a load of pent up frustration I asked Sandra if we could have a cuddle when we went to bed. I got the "do what you feel you need to do" response. I said no and I didn't want it to be like that, to which she replied "the damage is done, its not repairable any more".  I decided to go for a bike ride. Texted a friend who said he would come, then decided he had no lights. I did nearly 4 miles - flat out, on hilly terrain. I am totally unfit and hate exercise of any kind so it was a feat in itself.   On the way back all I could think of was cuddling up to Sandra in bed, so on the last hill home (a big climb) I really worked it hard. I am at the point now that I can't type straight, I am sweating profusly and feel unco-ordinated. I hope it bloody works!
