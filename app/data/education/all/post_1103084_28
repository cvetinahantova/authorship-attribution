. in michigan this past week .  we had quests with the cousins -- trekking across the dangerous Backyardis to recover some potion from the wooden castle to heal Queen Glorianis' fatal eyebrow twitching disease.  The costumes pictured here were Queen Glorianis' disguises (pulled straight from the Easter Cantata Closet) to sneak the children past the wizards --     Cousins, acting like foxes narrowly escaped their pursuers Bampa & Uncle Andy, colored with Aunt Gigi, posed for Gramma Glo, collected hundreds of tadpoles from the water above the pool cover.     The "notals" sat around the table for hours like the endless talkers we are.     And Bampa and I discovered / created a performance art / game that the kids (ok, and the adults) played over and over.  Who knew that a poolcover could be so great?
