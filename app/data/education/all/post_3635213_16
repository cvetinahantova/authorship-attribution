After many meetings, trainings, and hours spent working on my room, I'm almost ready for meet the parents Thursday night.  I'm excited and nervous at the same time.  My classroom has really started to come together and I am starting to feel a little more "at home" when I'm there.  It's still a little strange feeling.    I got a  urlLink palm pilot  today!  Yes Coppell ISD supplies their K-2 teachers with these because they have a great Assessment program on them that helps teachers to organize and monitor data about the students' reading needs throughout the year.  It is interesting because as teachers go, I seem to have a high intellegence in the computer world.  The other teachers were struggling to know the terms and work the buttons while I was jumping around in programs and figured out how to "beam" information to other palms way before they even taught us how.  I bragged about how BOTH my brother and his wife have palm PHONES.  The other teachers were in "a little awe" with that info.  Needless to say I'm excited about the new technology to play with.  I'm planning on finishing the major room things tomorrow... I hope. That's it for now!
