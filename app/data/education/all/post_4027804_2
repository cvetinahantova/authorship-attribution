Upon sleeping his 8 hours of rest, he awoken in the middle of the day. His body, well rested and already bathed, then prepared to leave the house for school.  The day began well. No anger or disturbances clouded his judgement thus far.  I didn't seem to have trouble undersatanding what was going on, as usual, but then again, I was half an hour late, and already had missed much of the teaching. ::shrugs:: I don't really care. There happened to be less seats today, as a face or two showed up that normally do not; one by the name of Deanna. I had no where to sit, therefore, I grabbed a posted chair/desk and unfolded it, planting myself in the middle of the room.  In the middle of the class (break for 15 minutes) I happened to be traveling to the same convenient store as Deanna, so I decided to go with her, and have a little chat.  The day ended pretty calm.  I also found out that I have an interview for a job tomorrow at 3. I do not feel like jynxing it, but then again, I do not really believe in jynxes, but mere coincidental acts of fate. Wish me luck.
