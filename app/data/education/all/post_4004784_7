If you didn't pick up the reference in the title of this post, I'm watching "I love the 90s" on VH1, and they are playing that Blind Melon song ("No Rain") with the bee-girl in the video...   Anyways, yay to everyone who's signed up for the blog so far.  (BTW - Blog is short for Weblog!) I can totally relate to dealing with crappy people at work - my boss wants me to come in on my vacation next week to go to a stupid meeting. Not only does he want to  disrupt my vacation , he wants me to somehow transport myself from Medford through Boston and down to Newport during the Democratic National Convention. Yeah, like that's gonna happen!   Karen thanks for sharing the pictures from your sister's wedding. She looked absolutely beautiful and so happy! I'll get my hands on some pictures of Carolynn and Justin's wedding from Adam this week so I can post them for all of you.  I hope everyone is having a good week! It was great to see all of you this weekend! I just wish we could do it more often!!  Anyone read any good books lately?? I'm running out of reading material!!   ~Caitlin
