urlLink Job Predictor  I am back from a week of vacation and I am feeling pretty good.  I found a fun (and mindless) site while I was away which predicts your ideal job based on your name.  I question the validity of the results but it is fun.  The results vary based on name so try your first name, your first and last name, your full name including middle name, etc.    Results for me:  Michael - Evil Boss (That is dead on!) Michael Lorenzen - Paleantologist Michael Gary Lorenzen - Reality TV Show star (I do want to get on Survivor...)
