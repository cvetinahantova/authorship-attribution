What a mornin...when i woke up,i thought that my dad was still gettin ready for work.Normally i don't wake up when my dad is there coz he will ask me to do so many stuffs like iron his shirt & all.But he was gone. K, I'm just so lame. Why on earth am i tellin ..all this unecessary..things..lol..Oh & my dad just called,he said he's in Tan Tock Seng Hospital.So i guess he might just come home soon..*sighs* I can't come online then..(Gr8!)
