Here it is then. The start of my blog. It is aimed at nobody but is available to anybody that can make use of things that interest me.   My first comment has to be about a product that I find excellent and I don't know if you have come across it but if you haven't then you might consider taking a look at  urlLink www.thebrain.com . Here you will find a wonderful piece of software that I used during a presentation at SQLPASS a few years ago. If you have heard of Tony Buzan and his mind maps then you will find this software moves towards helping you to create such things of your thoughts as well as your access points for knowledge, whether they be on your own hard disk. On a network drive or on the intra/inter or extranet.
