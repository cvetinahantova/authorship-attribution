Dedicated to: ADMV  Your little ways intrigue me: the way your eyes wrinkle when you smile, your hands a cascade of butterflies as you talk to me,  your hair falling carelessly on your forehead as we talk well into the early hours of the morning, your mind a well of thoughts I dive into eagerly. I love the way I can pick you from a crowd by the way that you walk; self assured and carefree,  the way your laughter can fill a room, and echo, long after your not there anymore. I love the way you care, how you can go on loving  even if is unwanted,  how your heart can renew itself -like a spring, eternally - and that you are never short of emotions. I am lost in the tender lines of your body, how you can seem so fragile when you sleep you seem so childlike, so innocent yet the power that emanates from you  keep me strong, and keep me safe. I adore the way you look at me, each time as if you are seeing me for the first time,  the way our eyes meet over a crowded room and locked in silence,  I know you can read my thoughts, that I cannot hide from your penetrating glance. I love the way you fold your arms around me, hugging me so tight, keeping me close to your heart like I am part of your chest, like you will never let me get away. To me there is so much magic  hidden away in the depths of your eyes,  so much warmth in you embrace, so much beauty in your smile, that I cannot help but watch silently and in smiling silence  as you sleep, when you talk, when you dream, and wait to be swept along  and enchanted by all that is you, You mesmerize meâ€¦
