I now fully understand why the Spanish have continued the aged practice of The Siesta.  To the rest of the world, it could appear that the Spanish are a lazy culture who can't bring themselves to work a full day without nap time.    That may be true, I wouldn't dare gauge the work ethic of every Spaniard here.  So, let's assume that most Spaniards have the stamina to work more than 5 hours straight.   Then why the mid-day 3 hour super-coffee break????  But it's too damn hot to do anything else...  Seriously.  You would think that with my snow-white tan, and my ability to burst into flames within seconds of walking into direct sunlight, that I wouldn't be caught dead in any country south of Finland.  But, the my surprise, I actually enjoy all the sunlight.  I think it's healthy.  Sometimes I even choose to walk on the sunny side of the sidewalk just to practice my squint and pray that these 10 minutes ambles might give me some color.  But the heat.. Oh the heat.  No human can be productive in heat like this.  Wether you like the heat or not, you cannot possibly fathom doing anything productive.  It's impossible.  So we just sit in one spot and wait it out.    This can be dangerous of course.  I woke up for my 6:00 class at 6:15 today, thanks to my little siesta.  It's not that I didn't get enough sleep the night before, it's just that it's too damn hard to do anything else!  I think I should start carrying around a pillow, and take my siestas outside the buildings I teach.  At least that way I can just roll off the bench and gross-motor ambulte into the classroom which is only meters away.  Of course, it's not like I'll be of any good use teaching... Because I'm sure my brain would have melted by that point.
