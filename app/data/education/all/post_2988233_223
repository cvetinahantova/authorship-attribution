Did you know a lack of B12 can really mess your body up?  Seems as if that is one of my dad's problems, his B12 level is only 52, when it is supposed to be at least 211.    He started B12 shots today.  Its a good thing too, he has had a very bad day today.  Can't seem to get out of bed.  So, hopefully, we are on the way to finding out what all is wrong with him..  He told me today he dreads having the CT scan and the MRI.  HE is afraid of what they will find.  I laughingly told him he was scared of finding out what was going to kill him before it did.  He said yep.  I am.
