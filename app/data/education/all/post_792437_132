Where are my black shoes!!!    Â  I knew it, I just knew it! So those maintenance men came to our house last week or so was it, and they totally screwed up my closet and took out all my shoes! Now I cannot find my favorite pair of black shoes! I wonder who took them, and what will I do? I need to wear them tomorrow and don't know where they are!! :( There's no need to buy a new pair..or is there? NO. I'm gonna go find those shoes!!!
