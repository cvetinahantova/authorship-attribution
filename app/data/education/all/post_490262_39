I heard or read somewhere that the Inuits (Eskimos, if you aren't pc) have over 50 different words for snow.  Here in the Seattle area it's kind of like that with rain.  It can be misting, sprinkling, spritzing, spitting, raining, drizzling, showering, pouring...  Today it's pouring and it has been all day.  That's actually kind of unusual for Seattle.  I mean, it rains all day a lot but usually it only pours for a hour or two and then shifts to one of the other rain styles for a while.  Rain means one dreaded thing when you are a teacher--rainy day recess.  Remember when you were a kid and you LOVED rainy day recess.  You got to play lame board games and go crazy in the classroom like you normally wouldn't be allowed to do.  Well, let me tell you, as a teacher it sucks.  Kids get hyped, really hyped, about being able to stay inside. That means trying to get them to settle down to do something as uninteresting as a math test is next to impossible.  If I could harness the energy in my classroom at this moment, well, let's just say I wouldn't be paying power bills anytime soon...
