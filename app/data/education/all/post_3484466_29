Muwahaha... I got up early this morning, so I actually get to eat some food. I'm going to be very happy today... hehe... Anyway, I just thought I'd update in the morning, since I have time. It's crazy... my weekend is already filled, and it's not even half way through the week yet. Friday's the last day of school, and there's another concert later in the day. Then Saturday, I'm at Nate's for the first half of the day, spreading sod around by that big brick thing they have... don't ask. After that, I'm supposed to go to some dance thing that Tegan is in, and finally, Sunday, I'm... crap, I don't remember. Whatever. Oh, well... it's father's day, and I was going to go out and buy my dad a new printer, because this one doesn't work on their computer anymore, but it works on mine.  Anyway, yeah. I'm done eating breakfast with 12 minutes to go. Awesome!  Current Music: The Mars Volta - Cicatriz ESP
