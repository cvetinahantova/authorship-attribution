urlLink Open Directory - Reference: Libraries: Library and Information Science: User Services: Information Literacy  I have blogged the Open Directory Project Information Literacy category today.  There are 57 quality sites on information literacy here.  The Open Directory Project is the best Web directory out there right now.  (Yahoo, the second best requires a $299 fee for a site to be considered.  The quality of Yahoo continues to decline.  How many good non-commerical sites won't pay?)   Other good Open Directory categories:   urlLink Reference: Education: Instructional Technology: Evaluation: Web Site Evaluation     urlLink Reference: Libraries: Library and Information Science: User Services: Library Instruction    (Note the Yahoo category with this name has 3 sites.  That is so pathetic and insulting to instruction librarians...)  urlLink Science: Science in Society: Skeptical Inquiry: Critical Thinking     urlLink Society: Issues: Education: Literacy: Information Literacy
