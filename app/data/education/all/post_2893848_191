Night of the Dawn of the Day of the Dead   Last night I watched all three of George Romero's Dead movies consecutively, a fine occasion to wrap lil' smokies in crescent rolls, drink whiskey in the dark and enjoying some fine company.  This was the first time I saw  Day of the Dead  .    It sucked in every way that  Dawn of the Dead   rocked, relying on cheap convention and gore where its predecessor managed, I think, to be truly innovative and psychologically interesting.  (It is tempting to make this symbolic of the difference between 70s and 80s cinema writ large, but I'm not really informed enough to do that.  Certainly, I'm not the first person to make this point about film history.  It reminds me of the Southern Reconstruction; perhaps this country's most progressive moment in history, often mistaken for a failure when, in fact, it was consciously and explicitly dismantled by reactionary forces.  Okay, so it's a pretty thin connection...)  If you are ever inspired to watch six consecutive hours of walking dead, allow me to recommend the substitution of the third movie in the cycle with the thematically (and otherwise) similar but vastly superior 28 Days Later .  The relation between Romero's three movies is loose enough that the progressing chronology is the most important link.    28 Days Later  could easily stand in as post Night/Dawn, just make sure to watch the alternate ending (the one in a hospital) to avoid the movie's biggest flaw, it's final scene.
