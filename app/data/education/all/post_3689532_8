hey all.. well i hope more people join cause this sounds like it has the potential to be really cool :) It's hard to keep in touch and this sounds like its easy enough to do especially if we see something interesting and want to know people's reaction to it....like for example - does ANYONE know what is going on with these elections. Honestly (and I don't hope to offend) I would never vote for Bush (even if I could but I can't - 4 million American citizens not voting for a prez, but we can still go to war...)...anyway is Kerry much different??? I mean same school, same society...granted he did actually SERVE instead of playing around in the guard.   Regardless I feel disconnected so please inform me!!!!!
