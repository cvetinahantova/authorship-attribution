Notice to everyone in duck-infested areas: If there is a pair of ducks  on the side of the road , DO NOT BLOCK THE WHOLE FUCKING ROAD! Damn it people, what the fuck is wrong with you? Ducks are a fucking plague here. Also: if you're moving 2 feet to the side of the road to apparently let a car pass, DON'T MOVE BACK JUST BEFORE THE CAR GETS THERE! YOU FUCKING RETARDS! DIE! DIE! DIE!
