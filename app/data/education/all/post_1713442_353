urlLink Adult Learning in and through the Arts. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Sandra Kerka.  It shows how the arts can aid adults in learning.  From the ERIC Digest:  It has become increasingly clear that millions of contemporary adults...have grown up with little or no grounding in the arts, and do not even consider participating in an artistic discipline or attending an arts event when choosing among their leisure and entertainment options (McDaniel and Thorn 1997, p. 6). The focus of much contemporary research and policy in arts education is on the K-12 level. However, arts learning experiences also benefit adults. Lifelong learning in the arts is a broad subject that may be viewed from many perspectives. This Digest discusses adult learning in the arts and addresses current issues in adult arts education.
