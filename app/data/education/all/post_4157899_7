Yes, that is us, the Jasso's with two players of the LA Galaxy! Chris Aloisi, #28. Alejandro Moreno, #15, is holding Siobhan. When he went to pick her up I told him to be careful that she is heavy. He told us he needed the practice. There sitting on the couch in the luxury suite, was Moreno's very pregnant wife. She was really sweet when Siobhan went over and started talking to her.  Now, of course we are fans of the LA Galaxy! This is our second season having season tickets. Last night we attended a game that we did not orginally have tickets for. What  a bargin. These seats for $52.00 included four general admission seats, four hot dogs and four cokes. What a deal! Where else can you have fun with the whole family for that kind of price. The seats were pretty good too, behind the goal, and four sections to chose from.  Next season the Chivas USA will be playing at the Home Depot Center as well. We hope that this might add to the fans not take away. If you ever want to attend a game with us, let us know. We are always happy to include someone else in the fun we have there. Besides nothing is cuter then hearing Siobhan yell "Gal-x-ee, Gal-x-ee", "Cobi!"
