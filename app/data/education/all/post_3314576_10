Lucy is whining, so this won't be long...  I feel like such a dork!  I mean seriously-- who is trained here:  me or the dog?  lol....  School is out and my room is almost packed up.  Yesterday I was sitting on a friend's porch and it suddenly started to downpour.  It was so awesome!  I love walking in the rain when it is coming down like that.  Let me specify though-- it wasn't lightening or thundering.  Last night I went to work out.  I finally tried this machine I have been eyeing (sp?) since I started going to the gym.  It's one of those machines that you see some lady using and you want to ask her "Did you take a class to learn out to use this machine?  That looks impossible!"  I did it for 10 minutes-- WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOO!  I'm proud.  I did my normal machines and treadmill for much longer, but I'm most proud of the 10 minutes on this gadget of a machine.  I was a whiner while I was doing it and I did think I was going to die, but in the end-- it was worth it.    I can hardly wait for Kelly's graduation party!  I just want to give her the biggest hug that will smash her ribs!  Well..... maybe I don't   really   want to do damage, but let's just say that I can hardly wait to see her in person!  To just sit there SEE her when we talk about the ridiculous things we talk about.  Sisters are the best.
