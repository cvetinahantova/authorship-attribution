Yes the time has finally come, the day I have been waiting for since the end of last year.  I am going to Japan, yes I am going to visit the mother land.  See all the sites and smell all that is what my ancestors have worked so hard for.  I realize that I am going at such an appropriate time, Chris is turning 23 the day after I arrive.  Its going to be so much fun but also strange because it will be the first time I'll have complete culture shock.  All the Kanji around me, calculating all of the Yen to see if I am getting ripped off or not.  I am having all of these crazy thoughts about what it will be and its only a little into the day at which I am leaving.  A smart person would be sleeping right now, all tucked in bed with thoughts of little geisha running around and perverted business men drinking their sake.  I leave Thursday and arrive Friday, its like I am experiencing the second Back to the Future movie.  Damn that's the crappy one, oh well!  All I know now is that I won't be in California anymore - even with all of the designer names running around and badly bleached hair.  Everyone there is going to look similar to me, I'll be playing "where is the white person" (similar to where is Waldo, you know).  I am so tired right now but can't get a wink of sleep.  I will keep all two of you who read my blog on a regular basis posted with my experiences in Japan.  Thank goodness Chris has internet and they have all those dot com cafe places.  The one advantage of being in the city, boy I might be ready to tackle New York one of these days.  But first I'll have to see how I fair with Japan.  Any feedback would be awesome, I know I have several misspellings and grammar but I don't care at this point because I am going to Japan. AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
