Write a 3-5 page report, discussing 1) where you would build a park in the United States, what kind of park it would be [theme? water or rollercoaster? for adults or children?], which rides, concessions, games, entertainment you would include, season length.  2) why your theme park would survive in that area and with that theme. Essentially you want to compare your proposed park to entertainment competition in your chosen area. Remember to discuss challenges and proposed solutions of that area. Keep in mind physical resources in the area you choose; cost of living; population density, growth, and demographics; weather patterns; transportation access.  You will present this information in a 8-10 minute powerpoint presentation on Wed, Aug 11. After your presentation you will turn in the hardcopy report to me.  Post questions about this assignment in the comments section.
