Michelle at  urlLink Dialog: Breaking the Bubble  links to a recent research paper about how teens between the ages of 13-17 create their identities and express themselves online. The study focuses on gender differences, but concludes: "there are more gender similarities than differences in blog use." In general, however, males tend to use emoticons in their posts more often than females, reveal their geographical location more often, and "use a more active and resolute language than females." Also, gay males are more likely to express their homosexuality via their blogs than females.  What does all this mean for those involved in online ministry? Perhaps this study can help those of us who strive to reach young people better understand how they project themselves into this online realm.
