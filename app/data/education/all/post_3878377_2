Yesterday I spent my time studying but I don't seem to be able to concentrate on what I was doing. We attended a mass and it made me feel a little light. We just retire then after a short despidida for Jorge, everything went that way... Today Jorge is leaving, he just have to while I go to school trying to make everything so perfectly ok, as if it is--doing the usual things that I am doing. I wanted him to be happy when he leaves, I don't want to shed tears or do all those emotional stuffs while he goes away. While I wait here I have to keep moving and do my review since September is fast approaching i barely have time to review. Things would be so different now... I was thinking time moves so fast, we have to adjust our own pace to keep up to it! Sooner or later things are changing with time. WE LIVE as if we are bound by it which should not be (the reason why I donot wear wrist watch).  Today I remember the fox and the little Prince talking "on the book: LITTLE PRINCE by Saint Exupery." The fox telling the little Prince to TAME him so that they will become friends and soon the little Prince tamed him and become part of his life. The little Prince realized that once you tame someone he/she will be the most unique person to you: there will be no other roses or foxes beautiful than what he tamed for and became part of his life---for it is the fox that he took time to spend and energy to be with, it is the fox that he cares deeply and it is that same fox that he loves so much..so there will be no other foxes that can ever change in its place in his heart. Soon the Little Prince has to LEAVE...because he lives in another planet and the fox said they will forever be connected to each other and he said "IT IS ONLY WITH THE HEART THAT ONE CAN SEE CLEARLY BECAUSE WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS INVISIBLE TO THE EYE."  and he said " Forever you will be responsible for what you tame."  I just thank God for everything.
