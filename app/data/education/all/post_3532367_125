So now the new kid has been in 2 minutes, takes his coat off and says "Has anyone boiled the kettle?" My reply..."Yes about an hour ago."  Well that starts it doesn't it. "Do you book 08:00 on your time sheet, I didn't think you were allowed too?"  ....The debate continues (and if you haven't guessed its another sore point) what with all the roadworks, poor weather conditions and time I owe due to having to go to the doctors. If I set out early in case of a bad journey, is it my fault that I get in early due to lighter than expected traffic? Or would they prefer me to come in late, just in case, and owe them another 30 mins?  FOR FUCKS SAKE!........It is me isn't it... I'm just being stupid aren't I?
