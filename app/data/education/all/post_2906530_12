The foolishness of roodbois! Roodbois continue to baffel me Only today two of my friends were beaten up by roodbois in a horrific fashion. to be specific one of my friends stepped on a roodbois foot as he tried to trip him up and for that they were jumped twice and were outnumbered 6 to 2! As if that wasnt cowardly enough they then proceeded to take the one who trod on the foot in question and he was hit round the face with a crash helmet as well as being continually punched around the face. All I can say is : MUST WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE ARE CONFRONTED BY FOOLS LIKE THIS OF VERY LITTLE OR NO INTELLECT OR COMMON SENSE! APPARENTLY SO AS WE NOW MUST BE CAREFUL NOT PROVOKE ONE LITTLE BASTARD WHO THINKS HE'S HARD! LEST WE FACE THE PROSPECT OF BEING JUMPED BY HIM AND FIVE FRIENDS! WHATS HARD ABOUT THAT ANYWAY! AS THE IDEA OF BEING HARD IS FIGHTING YOUR OWN BATTLES OR AT LEAST EVENLY AS THIS CASE IS, WITHOUT USING WEAPONS! HARD! COWARDS MORE LIKE IT ARRRRGH I HATE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
