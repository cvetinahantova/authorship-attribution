this poem i received from my faculty   ... ... ...  what did you do? why do we have a poem for you?  well, it has to do with a bike which we, of course, like  all of the sudden and without a sound you hit the solid ground  two bikes colliding a perfect sliding  it resulted in some pain a bruise or two therefore  a little present for you  an award in your name which will be added to the Master's hall of fame  hopefully you did not feel sore and please take my advise, do not get in accident anymore   *smile*   note: the first two lines are hidden ;)
