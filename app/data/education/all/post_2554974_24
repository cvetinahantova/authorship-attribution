----------------------------------------  Surprise... --------------------- 2dae i went for CS at pavalion wif alfiyan, izzat and his friend zul. I so sucked 2dae. Well.. after dat at e interchange i saw both haswani and hayati.. I was like.. shocked, petrified and overwhlemed. Well.. talked 2 yati though and her friend. Yati had diz sad look on her face which inturn made me sad 2.. Din tok 2 her much though.. i so regretted dat.. Well.. den i decided 2 kol her later.. I din noe wad 2 sae.. i juz wanted 2 hear her voice... again.. and again and again.. Well.. she's bz wif jc life so i think i shudn't bother her. I juz miss her alot.. If onli i cud go out wif her again.. oh well.. Den.. went 2 e park and met yasir n shariffah. Dey look so like a couple now.. aha.. well.. i was still feeling down though. Went for bubble tea den boarded e bus home. But! On e way up, e driver told me dat i can't go in w/my bubble tea! I was like.. WHAT?! Den.. so i juz left e couple alone.. den walked home which gave me e tyme 2 think more abt wad i shud do abt my feelings. Den i called yati again.. I din noe why.. I still fail 2 realise dat she has a guy. And when i do, my heart juz sinks again.. Depressed, oppressed and denied... wad am i saying? ahh.. nvm.. hang loose pple...
