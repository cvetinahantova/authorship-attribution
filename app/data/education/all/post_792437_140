Will a higher price make people quit?   I went on a trip recently with my famiy and on our way we stayed overnight in Michigan. On the nightly news in Michigan they were saying that Michigan will have the highest price for cigarettes in the nation. It sort of made me wonder. Do people really think that by increasing the cigarette price..people will stop smoking? I highly highly doubt it. I've had friends who were smokers and I asked them if the higher prices would make them quit...their answer was a simple "NOPE"
