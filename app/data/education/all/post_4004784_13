Today was my last day of work too. i too will miss it a little. my kids were  really great and some of the counselors were too (some of them not so much....) anyway i had to clean my whole room and vacuum and scrub stuff and throw away a ton of shit.  but im happy to be on a 3 week vacation. and now that i am you should invite me to MA more when you invite donna - haha.  and donna and dee we should hang out until work starts!  Sadly, philly - i got your message yesterday but i can't make it to the party because it's my gram's birthday and gilberto is coming in.  gotta have some good old family fun. I WILL SEE YOU ALL SOON THOUGH! i think i might have a fall time party or something since i didnt this summer. love to you all kris
