I have no idea why I am doing this. I already have one blog to post at. You'd think that would be enough. No, apparently not. It's strange. My other blog (http://loudcrowd.blogspot.com)is hidden from the public but open to my friends. This blog though is the exact opposite. I havn't told my friends about it but every time I post it will appear on the main page.  Loudcrowd.blogspot.com is a good site I guess. Hardly anyone posts there. My friend Morgan moved from the little town of Esperance where I reside in Western Australia all the way to Perth (the city, 8 hours away). In fear of falling out of contact with her I decided to re-create my dreams of a community blog with all of my friends posting. WE as a group are called the Loud Crowd by the librarian whose library we hang out in front of in the morning. She doesn't mind one bit though cause we always leave the area absolutely spotless. So that's how the name came about.  To whomever is reading this: Do you watch My Restaurant Rules? If not, you really should. For overseas people (i.e. not in Australia) you can get the episodes from http://tvt.milfclan.com. I'm voting for Perth. I'm been talking to Ash, and he's sending down some flyers so I can hand them around town and get people to vote.  Oh well, that's it for now. Bye.
