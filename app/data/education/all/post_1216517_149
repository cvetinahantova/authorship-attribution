I'm on break from teaching 7th grade history and language arts.  I played blackjack with a kid last period.  I whipped the pants off him, but I let him keep his money.  Next on the writing agenda is sketch comedy (snl, mad tv, kids in the hall, ben stiller show).  Yeah.  I want to write it, be in it, film it.  I'll be huge.  :)  oh yeah, and all that stuff i wrote about valentines and all that.  forget about it.  I really need to go to baja soon.  April 5th, baby!
