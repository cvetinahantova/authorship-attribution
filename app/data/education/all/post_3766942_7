Ah, love... exciting and new...  eHarmony.  Ok, so I've been doing the 'guided communication' thing with a fellow eHarmony matched me with.  Let's call him Smokey Joe.  We've finally gotten to the phone call stage.  He asked for my #, and I decided he seemed like an ok fellow... He called tonight.  We talked for an hour and a half... His picture is cute, and he has a child the same age as mine.  Same religion, same basic upbringing... according to eHarmony we must have a bunch of things in common that I don't even realize yet.      So why am I not on cloud nine?  Well, I'm not exactly down in the dumps, but I am going to be very careful with getting involved (as I always should I know).  There are a few red flags.  Not by any means dealbreakers, but just things that I need to think twice about.    He's been sober for several years.  Not a bad thing at all, in fact a really awesome thing.  But, do I want to knowingly get involved with an alcoholic?  His child has some behavioral issues.  It happens, and I hope the child isn't suffering because of this.  But should I knowingly get involved with someone who has a child with problems.  I know, God forbid one of my children had issues, and would I want someone saying the same thing.  But that isn't the issue.    It seems he has a history of um, somewhat psychotic ex's.    Well, I'm going to reserve judgement for now.  We really do have a lot to talk about, and it isn't marriage.  It's just a date.  We're going to go out sometime we can both get a sitter - hopefully in the next week or so.
