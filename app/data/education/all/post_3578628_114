I have had so much fun with my relatives lately and I love writing about it.  Today we went to breakfast at Tradewinds.  11 people there laughing and being disruptive while we pig out on excellent food.  Good times.  And then we came up with something we could go out and do.  At first, we thought Putt Putt... then it became a trip to the movies.  I was happy to go of course.  Except I had a tough choice on my hands.  One of the hardest decisions I have had to make lately.  I had to choose between Day After Tommorow and Dodgeball because our group was splitting up and going to both.  I hadn't seen Day After Tommorow and the movie's effects made me want to go but then again the story seemed hokey.  But I was sure about Dodgeball.  That movie is so freakin hilarious.  Naturally, I picked Dodgeball and I made the right decision.  The adults in my family watched it and found the movie to be incredibly hokey.  I'll stick with Independence Day.    We also made a trip to Barnes & Noble.  Great place ...I had a giant coffee and some great laughs.  I found this book of bunny suicides and it's just great.  Any animal rights activist will hate this book, but I would say loosen your panties and laugh it up.  I'm gonna buy it and show to you all sometime.  Bunny Suicides...  Well, great day.  I'm happy I can laugh and enjoy being with relatives.  Otherwise, life would suck.
