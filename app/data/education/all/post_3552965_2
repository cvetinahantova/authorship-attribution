Some of his best catchphrases were wheeled out this evening.  On the subject of what I should do with my life, Dad waxed lyrical.  'I dunno sweetheart.' (Dramatic pause exploited to inhale more deeply on his 56th cigarette of the day.) 'I wish I could put an old head on young shoulders...  but I can't.'  You've got to love the old man.  Well, you, dear reader, don't have to obviously, but I do.  'You might think I'm just a daft old man.  I'm not computer literate.  I'm not clever like you.  I don't read The Guardian.'  And with that, he bursts out laughing - the special laugh that sounds somewhere between a long gargle and a giggle.  My dad holds The Guardian in the lowest possible esteem - perhaps even lower than Tony Blair and 'them Pork 'n' Cheeses'.  Can't work it out?  It's rhyming slang for a nationality - and remember, 'we woz robbed...'  (If you really can't work it out, email me and I'll think about putting you out of your misery...  for a price.)  So, back in Yarmouth again.  The journey across the Fens was magnificent: it was late afternoon, the sun was shining and I really appreciated all the greenery, especially after having lived in a city where what was supposedly a park seemed more to resemble a traffic island.  I think there was even a rainbow over Breydon Water but that may just be poetic license (you the public decide.)  I've decided to come home because I'm too just wiped out to do anything else at the moment.   I'm pretty sure that I don't want to do the summer school.  I broached the subject with Mum and Dad this evening and Mum didn't seem too keen but there's been no definite answer given yet so we'll just have to wait and see.   The best thing to do is to sleep on it I'm sure.  So, up the apples and pears for me as I used to say when I was wee...
