urlLink Empire North - The logical solution :  Now you got to be suspicious of every little mosquito bite.  "The ID SNIPERTM rifle designed by EMPIRE NORTH      What is the ID SNIPERTM rifle?  It is used to implant a GPS-microchip in the body of a human being, using a high powered sniper rifle as the long distance injector. The microchip will enter the body and stay there, causing no internal damage, and only a very small amount of physical pain to the target. It will feel like a mosquito-bite lasting a fraction of a second. At the same time a digital camcorder with a zoom-lense fitted within the scope will take a high-resolution picture of the target. This picture will be stored on a memory card for later image-analysis. "
