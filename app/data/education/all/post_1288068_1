Some really good things happened in London and environs today. And some horrid things too.   A couple of lovely things:  The li'l tykes had their exams today , meaning that I didn't have to teach AT ALL. Which in turn means that I have finished my KS3 essay, although it is unmitigated shite. Some kids were vaguely perturbed that I am leaving. Aw. Nice things happened to good people.   And the not so lovely:  I got myself all upset and befuddled about the Summer. I literally had six days left unaccounted for such was my workload. After seeking advice from, well, everyone, I decided to pull out at short notice from the summer work I got ages ago. Meaning that the people involved now hate me. Justifiably, given that I've dropped them in the shit a bit. The teacher who asked me to do it in the first place is v v angry at me. *sobs pathetically*  This is nothing to get upset about, right? So I've pissed off a few people I'll never see again after tomorrow. It is difficult to be a let down. But! I have cleared a full three weeks of my schedule. Am so so relieved.  TOMORROW IS MY LAST DAY IN MY PLACEMENT SCHOOL.
