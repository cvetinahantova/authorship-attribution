urlLink Literature Circles. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Chia-Hui Chin.  It reviews the concept of literature circles.  From the ERIC Digest:  The reading materials used in literature circles are important to lively and meaningful discussions (Farinacci, 1998). According to Brabham and Villaume (2000), fiction is the most commonly used reading material in literature circles, although other types of texts, such as nonfiction, picture books, and newspaper articles can also be used with great success. Some authors, including Farinacci (1998) and Peralta-Nash and Dutch (2000) have suggested the following criteria for selecting texts to use in literature circles:   * Comprehensible to students of different abilities and interests   * Reflect students' language needs and skills   * Address issues/topics relevant to students' lives   * Provoke students' thinking and discussion   After students have selected the reading materials they wish to read, the literature circles are formed in accordance with their reading interests or book titles they choose.
