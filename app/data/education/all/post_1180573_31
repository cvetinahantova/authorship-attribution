If I Reach Out For You...   morph into a mermaid, I swim! relish a quiet noise by the sea. let the waves lead me. and wash my tears.   [Just Wanna Be With You]   the wind blows me, I fly! fearless, with my broken wings.  no gravity. light. empty. and lost.   [Just Wanna Be With You]   through the rain, I run! coldness freezes my feet. the thunder swallows my calling.   [Just Wanna Be With You]   world keeps moving, i don't give a damn! laid lonely down beneath the darkness. ashamed. scared. and tired.   [Just Wanna Be With You]   for heaven and earth  [Just Wanna Be With You]  but can't find a way to get there    ...Would You Reach Out For Me Too?
