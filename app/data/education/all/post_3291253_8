urlLink gmail swap: checking for invitations   Ok.. what's this about "active" bloggering? I think I failed to read the fine print on this page, or is there? I want my account. Do I have to keep blogging to get one? Well, I will blogg you all to death.   Just so you know, I got an account at blogger.com even before I knew it was a "gateway" to get a gmail accoun.  Not that I will ever get one.  Just my luck.
