OK here's the thing...lol I am dumping all my friends... I realized it was the best thing to do today...see... I was watching my cousins today and I realized that I had more fun with a 5 and 7 year old then with people MY age! lol No offense to anyone! lol I love you guys .....but these little people understand me...lol *Smiles* It was soo fun...  We were playing jedi... and I was a jedi and I had a pink lifesaver and we were killing bad guys... I like my lifesaver.. anyways..lol .... well I went to the bad side and they both killed me... dead.... to the wet ground.... I meant it was wet? lol and then I came back alive and grabbed one of them and the other one killed me again...lol It was fun.. O I think this 7 year old is smarter then I am ....lol  well he is 7 as I said and he is reading the 3rd Harry Potter book! and had several chapter books already... and finished and 1 and 2 Harry potter.....  but that is not why he is smarter then me....  He was telling me things...Scientific things.... and I was just nodding acting like I knew what he was talking about.... and he was talking about energy and it scared me.....  He would probably make a bunch more then most of this freaking idiot they have on who wants to a millionaire....lol  anyways.....good bye friends.... I love you guys and never well forget you but for now... and am going to be a 7  year old again.... now leave me alone.... or I will tell my mommy! lol Loves Sheila
