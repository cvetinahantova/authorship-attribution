urlLink A link  (you must register)   Sometimes I wonder who all these promiscuous people are and other times I confront the fact that they are people who are all around me.  Something about me leaves me out of these types of games, and other times my very neutrality causes people to tell me details about  their lives.  Presumably these people find each other somehow, the girl mentioned in the above link that had sex for money while working at her government job; she must've signalled her availability to this type of activity somehow.  I can't imagine men propositioning women in the office with a line like, "Hey baby I'll give you $200 if you sleep with me."  Apparently it does happen but the communication is happening on a plane I'm not even aware of.
