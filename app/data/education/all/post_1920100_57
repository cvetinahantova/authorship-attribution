Yesterday was the last day of the first session of art camp. The day went well and the students were anxious to show off their masterpieces and to act in their play. Chad did a great job with this play because the students really enjoyed it! I will miss the kids, but I am looking foward to the next group. The next session is three weeks long. On Monday I have my first interview for a teaching position. YEY!!!Thank You God!!! This whole weekend I am preparing for it. Keep me in prayer.  I really need God's strenght at the moment please keep me in your prayers.
