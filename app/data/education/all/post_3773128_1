Today we started our first physics class. As with every first class, we were asked by the teacher to introduce ourselves. Frankly, I don't see the point of having Maths and Physics class during the 3 months that we're here. It's not like we have time to go into the details and even if we do have the time it might not help much since everything will be in Korean next time.      The only reason that I could think of is that they want us to use our right brain as well instead of just our left brain. Maybe they want us to have a more busy life than we already have.     But, actually I like a busy life. I fell the meaning of life only when I'm up and about doing something. Life seem so meaningless when we sit back and do nothing.      So it seems that I SHOULD find a good hobby when I'm in Korea so that I don't waste my life there.      Following Toh Hui's advice, I'm starting to go to room 510 more often ever since the misunderstanding with Poh. It seems that I can get along with them quite well :)      Maybe I'm having the wrong concept that the grass on the other side of the river is greener, but sometimes I just feel that the people in the other programs are friendlier. Maybe I'm not spending enough time with the people in my own programs...      Just got the news that Jian Wei got the offer to go into ATU.      It seem strange to me that I didn't think of appealing ever since I receive the offer. Maybe I was very certain that this is God's plan for me.      I do hope I'm not making a grave mistake...      Asked Hock Siang to go to wai Peng's house this weekend, but he just didn't want to.     Well, maybe it's my nature not to feel ashame or guilty going to people's house and causing inconvenience for them :)      With so much homework in my hand and no companion, it seems that my plan of going to Malacca has to be postponed :(
