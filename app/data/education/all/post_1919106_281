Today  Yesterday a student addressed me as "sir". Suddenly I feel old. Very, very old. I guess it's time for me to get a senior citizen card, pull my pants way up, and get a checkered jacket. And I'll have to work on providing involuntary flatulence. Bean dip, here I come!  At least there's a farmer's market close by for me to plow through with the car.
