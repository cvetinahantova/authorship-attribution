Oy veh, I'm tired. I have no idea why. Maybe it's because I'm more active than I used to be, and my body just can't handle it. Who knows? All I know is that if I were to lie down, I'd be asleep in five minutes.  Can you tell I'm avoiding work again? I'm supposed to be working on my Shakespeare assignment, studying for 2 tests, and reading  Major Barbara  for Contemp. Drama, and here I am on the internet.  Well, better get to it. I so cannot wait for Spring Break. Or at least Saturday.
