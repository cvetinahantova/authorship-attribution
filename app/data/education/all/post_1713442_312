urlLink Can an online tutorial pass the test for library instruction?  This is   by Marion Churkovich and Christine Oughtred.  It is an evaluation and comparison of library skills instruction methods for first-year students at Deakin University.  From the site:  An online, interactive tutorial, Smart Searcher, was introduced at Deakin University as part of the library's information skills program in late 2000. As liaison librarians responsible for library skills training we wanted to compare and evaluate this mode of instruction with our normal face-to-face delivery of library instruction. This study found that students with face-to-face instruction did, in fact, gain higher post-test mean scores than students completing the online tutorial. Also, students attending these library sessions felt more confident about their library skills than those in the online tutorial only session.
