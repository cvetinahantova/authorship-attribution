Life is immeasurable.  I was thinking about the term "astronomical unit". It's the distance from Earth to the Sun, about 94 million miles, and thus it is used to measure distances in space.  Distances. In. Space. But it's an arbitrary measurement. We just decide that thats a good distance to use, because it's what's familiar to us. But this measurement depends on two objects taking up a place in space.  Here and  there. And the thing is, if there isn't a here, there can't be a there. Interconnectedness.  Indra's Net. Entanglement. Entanglement means that, at a quantum level, sometimes atomic and sub-atomic particles get somehow connected. And from that point on, whatever happens to one, affects the other.  Isn't life like that? Everything relies on everything else, and if we're blind to that, we run the risk of thinking we're in control. And we're not.
