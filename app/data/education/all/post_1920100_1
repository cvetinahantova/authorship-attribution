Hello  sorry for taking a while but last time I tried posting something up it messed up and it didn't go through...u could only imagine how upset I felt. Anyway I guess it was not meant for me to post that message. I won't rewrite it because it was too long but the main point of the last message was describing where I come from, my relationship with God and what I am going through at the moment. The biggest thing that I am going through is being able to resist temptation and trusting God. The scripture that I have held close to my heart and has kept me going through tough times has been "Entrust your ways to the lord and he will act on your behalf"  This scripture has served me for encouragement and a form of direction because there has been times where I have been wanting to do things "my way" even if it is not the right thing to do. But lately I have been trying to sacrifice my self to God and submitting myself--which can get difficult because I get anxious easily when I do not know what to do or I have no answers. Either way God always seems to hold my hand and guide me I just have to learn how to be more humble and loving. Please pray for: One for my family so that they let God work in their lives and so that they can share with his love and grace, For my relationship with my boyfriend  let God provide us with love, patience, understanding and may he help us carry our relationship in a Godly way for his glory, and last for my sister in laws family may God provide them with the strength to get through these tuff times (their son was shot and killed a week ago) and also may God give me many opportunities to serve him and  glorify him. I pray for wisdom and more love. In his son's precious name~ AMEN  Well I hope you all are doing well. I appreciate your friendship and I thank God for being there for me. Blessings
