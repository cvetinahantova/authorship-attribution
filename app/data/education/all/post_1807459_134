So this is more or less our last day here as GJ leaves tomorrow morning at 7am.  I did manage to track him down yesterday.  We were running around in circles looking for each other.  We did hit the zoo up and walked around a different part of town.  I think GJ is a little toured out.  We've seen a ton sights and now he's gone shopping crazy.  I'm cool with whatever he wants to do b/c I'll have another two days here or so after he leaves so I'll do whatever it is I want to then.  Speaking of that I think I want to catch a movie.   The zoo wasn't great but I thought it was good enough.  Like everything in Thailand it was cheap and it was about what I expected.  GJ was a little disappointed b/c we didn't see any rhinos.   The walk there and back was cool.  We got to see the government buildings and the place where the king lives I think.  We had a chill evening and then got turned around and hit the clubs.  I'll have to write more about that tomorrow b/c I just don't have the motivation to do it justice now.   The 7 elevens here have coke slushies and that in and of itself has made the trip worthwhile.  I need to sit down and write in my diary.  There are so many little funny incidents I'm afraid of forgetting that have really made the trip so much fun.  I'd write about them here but they'd only be interesting to me so I'll spare you.   No plans for today except to go out one last time tonight and giver hardcore.  I just can't be bothered with spell check.
