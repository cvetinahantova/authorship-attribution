The Interim Administrative Committee is finalizing logistics of the process for submitting proposals. We should have an update for you by tomorrow, Friday. Tentatively, here is how it will work:  Friday, May 23rd: UFPJ will post a downloadable proposal form on the UFPJ website.  Friday, May 30: Deadline for people to submit their proposals on this form to proposals@unitedforpeace.org Tuesday, June 3: A UFPJ subcommittee will group these proposals and post and/or email them to you a few days before the conference so you have time to review them. There is no guarantee that proposals submitted after May 30 will be sent out ahead of time.  ============================================  HOW YOU CAN HELP BUILD THE CONFERENCE  1. MOST IMPORTANT: Make specific commitments to recruit 5-8 specific groups/individuals THIS WEEK in a core and/or underrepresented sector/community/region where you exercise influence.
