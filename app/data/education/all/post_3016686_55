Gee, I don't belong to iTunes, but since Rufus is the Greatest Living Artist Since Kate Bush, I'd guess I should join now.  Because his label is a shitstorm, Rufus is doing a  urlLink teaser on iTUnes  and then releasing "Want 2" or a series of EPs before the end of the year.  Here are some song titles from it: Gay Messiah, I'm Not Ready, The Art Teacher and Homegrown Waltz.  Bit of The Art Teacher lyrics:   There I was in uniform  Looking at the art teacher.  I was just a girl then;  Never have I loved since then.  He was not that much older than I was  He had taken our class to the Metropolitan Museum.  He asked us what our favorite work of art was,  But never could I tell it was him.  Oh, I wish I could tell him-- Oh, I wish I could have told him.
