It would seem that this has turned into somewhere where I just go to moan,but never mind. Today I have discovered that I am totally useless. I have gone from an independant woman who has her own income and can provide for herself and do everything for herself, to a gibbering useless idiot. I seem totally incapable of the most basic tasks for one reason or another. Today whilst trying to assemble a shoe rack it fell on me. Yes it was a little painful, but not enough to usually reduce me to tears. Unfortnately I then started to feel sorry for myself and realise that this was something I could have done standing on my head in the past. When I moved into my house (5 years ago now) it was a shambles, totally unfit for human habitation in my opinion. However I put my nose to the grindstone and did my best to make it better for myself and the children. This meant decoration throughtout and some DIY stuff. I did this without any trouble at all, but now even something like sorting out a chest of drawers has turned into a major ordeal. I just feel useless, like I can no longer contribute to the family, and that I am putting too much pressure on my already over pressurised husband. I think the strain has been showing on him lately too, he seems very discontent with things as they are. I just don't know what to do to make things better. I feel so exhausted most of the time (exhaustion like I have NEVER felt before) this compounded with the fact that I'm not sleeping well either is some of the problem, but not all. I can't see anyway to change it until the baby is born, but that just seem like such a long time away, and there is so much to be done in the mean time. I sometimes feel that I just get in the way and make things worse for everybody. And guess what...... yes tomorrow's Monday, guess which day isn't my favourite day of the week????????
