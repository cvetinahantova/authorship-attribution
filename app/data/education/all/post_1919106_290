Since I don't watch broadcast news, I am pretty much detached from much of the media sensationalism. So I tend to just shake my head whenever people ask me if I heard about this crime spree or that beheading. And when I finally hear about how unethical news corporations are with their boradcasts, it kinda makes me glad to be so detached. Sorry bolks, but I have no sympathy for any group that blatantly claims to tell the truth but doesn't check on the facts, and then  urlLink blames third persons  for their own fuckups. Laugh at me for watching cartoons - at least  they  make me smile.
