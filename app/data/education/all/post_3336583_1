Today was my first official day of  SUMMER VACATION ! I slept until 9:45, did a little shopping at some local scrapbook stores ( urlLink Archivers  and  urlLink The Crop Stop ), went to  urlLink Ulta  to restock beauty supplies, visited Julie, Sarah, and Baby Alex, and worked on grad school stuff (blah). Each season I get a some new makeup and it is amazing how great a new nail polish can make you (and your toes) feel! I am looking forward to spending time with friends and family, scrapbooking, and going to the beach on the 4th of July. Yeah for summer time!
