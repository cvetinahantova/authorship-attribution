heading off for pittsburgh in the morning; bound to be an interesting weekend.  i've seen g-ma on "good" days and on "bad" days, and apparently she's on a bad streak lately, although usually the first day we visit she usually is excited enough to see us that it's a "good" day, no matter how she's really feeling.  nonetheless, it's always a mental battle of how to cope with how she is now until i actually get there... once i'm there with mom, it'll be fine... until then, i think too much about it... mostly i just miss who she was before her strokes... so i guess in a way i've been missing her for 4 years even though i've seen her regularly all that time.  4 days in a nursing/retirement home... woo hoo.  catch y'all on monday.
