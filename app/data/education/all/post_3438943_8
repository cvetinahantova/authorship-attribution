Does this send out emails everytime a new post goes out?  Thats the major function of the yahoogroups that made it worthwild even tho it's really lame and full of advertisements.  If it wont send out emails just by posting, maybe we can just send out a group email with the new posts.  The features are deffinetly awsome here tho.  -Bryan
