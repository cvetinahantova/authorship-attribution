i think that i've realized that when i get really really busy (see last post), I don't really have anything simmering on the back burner -- I mean I don't forget all of the things that are or were there -- it's more like I just experience life as this huge undifferentiated mass.  I feel about everything, I think only about the one single thing that is on my exactly front burner.   One of my goals for this semester was to FEEL MORE, think less.  It's happening, but I think maybe I wanted to have kind of a think-about-feeling experience more than a straight feeling experience.   so how exactly am i to interpret Jewel's maxim, to "follow your heart, your intuition -- it will lead you in the right direction," on days like this when -- following my heart will lead me -- to bed. to go to sleep.  is that the right direction?
