Feeling a little down today, as I desperately search for alternate classes.  I did have plans on leaning new software programs in the fall, but alsa that dream hass been dashed.  After yesterday's post, I should be happier , however, it ain't easy.  :-(  Didn't do much of anything.  I don't feel like it.  I need a day to mope about.    One co-worker didn't show up to work.  She's a mess.  She really needs to get her act together cause she's all no work, and all play.  Must be nice.
