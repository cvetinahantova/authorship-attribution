I'm in Seoul now.  It has been a fun night.  I couldn't go to Suwon b/c there wasn't a bus from the express bus terminal that left to go there.  Anyway I went to the 63 building today and took a cruise down the Han river.  After that I met up with Asma and Brian in Sin ch'on.  We then went off to see Jeff and his cousin Megan who are staying at a nice ass hotel.  After that we headed out and drank a little but nothing crazy.  I think we are saving the craziness for tomorrow night.   I'm unclear as to what Andrew is accusing me off on his blog.   Maybe we will find out.  I left a comment related to the statement.  Anyway I hate Seoul traffic.  Too many cars and people. Tomorrow Caleb and the Guminator should come up.  I think tomorrow should  be a good time.  Apparently we are eating a vegetarian dinner.  To hell with this I'm done.
