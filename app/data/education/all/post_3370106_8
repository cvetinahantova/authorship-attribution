In a society girded on all sides and from within by violence it should come as no surprise when reports of the most heinous acts emerge from the belly of the beast.  Yet so many act surprised that a culture of rape prevails in the military.  Well, no wonder!  "Don't ask don't tell" is the kind of policy that essentially condones violence against female and male bodies.    In such an atmosphere it becomes increasingly clear to me that in order to make any sense at all, in order to find any happiness or joy, that I must trust in the path I have begun to walk, a path that delves ever deeper inward, not in isolation, but in understanding that transcends the physical world and makes ever more apparent that the tragi-comedy of life is purely meant for our enjoyment.  The more I trust in the path, the more I yearn for light to infuse my core, growing, increasing energy, spilling over with spirit that is not self-righteous, but of service to others.  I know that for violence to end I must first understand and deal with my own violence.
