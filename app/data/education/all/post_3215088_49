Today can be considered a special day in the CHOO family. My bro has become the first graduate from the CHOO family..... saw the pics he took at his convocation today. Can imagine after so many years of finally, it has finally ended for the time being. Soon it will be my turn ( i hope so... :P) .  For me, i didn't attend his convocation though.....at home sleeping cos no point going when i cannot enter the auditorium and have to loiter outside for two hours...might as well sleep at home.    Went to the bank today to bank in my pay....very little oni....better than nothing lah...gonna save it for my hostel fees and allowance during the term period. Hmm...i still have 3 pay slips pending and a fourth pending after i do my camp on the 19th....once all of them come, my life shd be relatively comfortable....at least my hands are looser then.        Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
