How do you know if you're an addict ... if it's not to a contraband substance?   I am absolutely exhausted today for absolutely no reason to day. Except possibly that I haven't had a cup of coffee. Otherwise, I slept great. Everything worked out yesterday, I brought my computer home and for the first time in a long while was able to complete my classwork at a reasonable pace.   So, Why am I soooo tired? I haven't the slightest idea.
