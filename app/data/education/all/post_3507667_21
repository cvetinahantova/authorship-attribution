So after a hard days work, I decide to hit the sack a little early last night. I'm fast asleep when I hear a scream, some heavy crashing sounds, then a door slam, and laughter.  So, being inquisitive, and now fully wide awake and freaked out, I decided to investigate. Apparently, my daughter Jecynda "look daddy a birdy" Bartholomew, was lying down and saw a bird hanging in the corner of my mom's room. She pointed this out to my mom and that's when all hell broke loose. The, terrified bat, freaked out and started to fly around the room. The girls lost it and ran like hell out of the room closiing the door leaving my mom in the closed room with a flying bat. So naturally she grabs a broom that was handily in there and started whacking crazily. *note: The girls were watching tv in there until bed time.  So..here cometh the groggy, freaked-out, savior, Robert. Not knowing any better I opened the door to be confronted with a quite dishevelled mother and a a very pissed off bat. My mom took that opportunity to make her escape nearly bowling me over in her haste.  So I grabbed the broom, and closed the door, and waited for the bat to settle down and land again. I then tried to herd it out the open window, but it was having none of that. Finally, I got a bit peeved and used the broom as a baseball bat and sent the bat flying out the window with a single mighty swing.  Unfortunately, I found out this morning that I ended up hitting it too hard and killed it. So now I'm feeling a tremendous amount of guilt and a bit like a wimp for not just grabbing a towel and getting it that way.  Suffice as to say, everyone finally got to bed, except for me, I was now fully wide awake. So now I'm at work, tired, guilt ridden, and self indited as a bat murderer.  Ahhhhh...what a day!    :o)  The moral of this story...Don't panic, it's just a flying mouse.  RLB
