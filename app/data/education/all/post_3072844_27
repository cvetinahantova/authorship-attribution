Oh, and by the way, i went to Helen's book and cake sale today; it was quite fun and we sold all the cookies (yay!). But did you know, Gracie, that Joe still flirts? I thought after his chance went at Viney Hill he'd just take no notice of me any more - but he still seems to come and stand close and hint when he talks and stuff. And talks about completely random stuff just for something to talk about. He told me about how they have a river at the bottom of their garden, and a guy lost his shoe into it and the shoe has probably floated up to Cirencester or something by now. You gotta admit, guys can be pretty sweet sometimes! I know i  always  say that guys are sweet, but sometimes they sooo are!!! Like when they wave at you. That's really sweet.  (hee hee, goes off into little dreams about guys)
