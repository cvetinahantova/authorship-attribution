John and I just got back from church.  It's another warm muggy day.  I really don't care for humidity.  I like dry heat much better.  Today we are going out to lunch with grandma and grampa, and grandpa's son and his wife (son from a previous marriage).  Originally we were going to meet at mom and dad's to say good bye to nate, but nate got sick and so we are going to meet at the Spagehetti Factory instead.  I love the Spagehetti Factory, but I'm not really looking forward to it today.  I started a wheat free diet last week to see If wheat might be the culprit of my joint/bone pain.  The pain might just be realted to my Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  At anyrate I jsut want to get to the bottom of my fatigue and pain.  IT can be very debilitating at times!  Please pray for me.  Anyways, I'll half to order one of their non pasta dishes and skip the yummy bread with garlic butter (big bummer!!!!!!).  I'm seeing an allergist in a week or so to determine if I do indeed/or do not have a wheat allergy/intolerance. Alos, keep Jerry Weber in Your prayers.  He is like an adopted grandpa to me.  His wife and hiim always opened their house to me and my friends when I went to school at Biola!  They even flew up to Oregon, just to come to our wedding.  He has kidney failure and a staff infection.  He wil be in the hospital for several weeks.
