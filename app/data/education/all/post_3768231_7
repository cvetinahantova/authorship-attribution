Movies...  watched "The Fisher King" with Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges the other night - great film - very bizarre, but a fav (a gr8 b'day prezzie too). Also watched 'The Gift" today (the flatmate's DVD collection is getting a bit of a workout)... good film, well shot etc. I don't usually like these sorta films, but this one's pretty good. Also saw "Rob Roy" which was about a 2 out of 5. Beautifully shot, and that's about the best part of it!!!
