lara's top story of the day:  best told copied and pasted from an email i wrote earlier... enjoy  "so kristin (aka rooooooommate) just got back late last night from 2 weeks in mexico for her j-term... while there in mexico city she randomly meets this couple whose last name she recognizes... the conversation went something like this:  kristin: "brondos... you're not liz's parents are you?" david (brondos): "yes... you know her?  how?" kristin: "yeah from valpo" david: "how'd you meet her?" kristin: "well, it's a funny story actually... my old roommate goes to the same church in memphis as your parents... she was gone liz's first semester but told me to look out for her since i could speak spanish too and just because she's a brondos..." david: (interrupting) "you're lara's roommate?!?!?!" kristin: "well, yeah" david: "she went to hungary, and (blah blah blah)"  apparently these people in mexico who i've never met have an hour's worth of lara stories to tell at the mention of my name... how most hilarious is that?"  duuuuuuude... the end
