hello,  well i found a job.  i am working at st. joe for a nun named sister erlinda.  guess we will see how it goes.  i am a little scared but not much i can do but give it a try.  one funny thing i forgot to mention about thailand is that you see kids with english written on their shirts but it is usually improper english or does not make sense.  kinda funny.  guess i will be trying to help with this problem.  i have a cell number now so if anyone wants to reach me i have free incoming calls.  it is  010081407.  i am not sure what kind of international numbers go along with that or if that is all you will need to dial.  well gotta go.  jane  ps.  i can not wear pants or skirts that do not cover my knees at the school.  those of you who know me well can probably imagine the pain it was for me to shop today.  but i got enough stuff for a few days.  love ya.
