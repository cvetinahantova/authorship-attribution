What is the nature of 'not me'. I can't know anything about 'not me' except from my senses. My senses tell me that 'not me' is very big, much bigger than 'me'. I also know that I can change 'not me'. I can manipulate it to suit me at times, and at times, I can't do anything about it's state at all. Not me contains what appear to be other 'me's. They seem to be similar to me in many ways. I seem to feel, sense and perceive things in a very similar way to many of these other 'me's. I know this from my experience interacting with them (The fact that we can communicate at all requires a lot of commonality between us). These other 'me's seem to have quite a lot to do with my happiness. They have the ability to make me very happy and very sad, more than most other 'not me' stuff. I'll file this in the back of my mind...
