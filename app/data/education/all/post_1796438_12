Merry Christmas  Sorry, but I don't really have anything to talk about right now. It's the beggining of the holidays, and I havn't seen anyone. Don't worry, this will be updated by someone else as soon as I can actually find soemone else. Biggest news now is the talk of a possible group metting on the 6th of January. Finsh and Chips, drinks, movies, etc. More information as soon as it becomes avaliable.
