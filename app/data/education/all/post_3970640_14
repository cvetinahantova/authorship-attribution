Had a fantastic time away "up north". Didn't want to return, but alas I did have to go into work if I'm going to be able to afford more trips away in the future.  After all this relaxation, it was a real shocker to come home to a computer infected with Spyware. Tell me, who in the heck thinks up this crap?!?! There is one program on my computer that I did find a removal program for, however you actually have to buy it! I bet the same person/company made up the evil spyware and the fix. *sigh*  I have tried  urlLink Spybot S&D  and  urlLink WebSweeper  with no luck. In my search for a "cure" however I have discovered quite a number of people in the same boat... I don't feel so alone :) Heck, check out  urlLink Keith Deven's  weblog! He's got a whole section devoted to spyware!
