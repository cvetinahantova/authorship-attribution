Hannibal, MO - I was in Java Jive coffee house today and watched a group of kids on a field trip come in wanting to buy Hot Chocolate.  There were about 8 boys.  Not everyone could afford the hot chocolate.  A man, unrelated to the group, stepped up to the counter and bought drinks for all the boys.  They were dumbfounded and thankful.  It was a great moment.
