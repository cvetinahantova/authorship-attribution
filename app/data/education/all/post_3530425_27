In this age of instantaneous digital information, we make judgments as quickly. David didn’t make our date to IM, not by an hour or more.  So I wonder about his promptness.  He was late to meet me at the bar too.  Promptness signals a certain cohesiveness of mind that he may not possess.  He reminds me of Lisa, my ex-sister-in-law.  Excited about the same things each time we talk, awed by the cost of things, slave to the details.  He’s smarter than she is, but nearly as obtuse, in a strange way.  He’s not the man I hoped he’d be.    And now, he wants to talk about having had sex, about his bizarre comments.  As if, somehow, he thought that being my “bitch” would somehow turn me on.  Maybe it’s a cultural nuance that I’m missing, but it sounds to me like some sort of sexual aberration, maybe an indication that he’s bisexual.  His strangely non-PC comments about his gay neighbor (accompanied by a drooping hand) make me wonder, now, if he’s somehow involved in the gay scene.    Or, maybe, he was just trying to please me.  Maybe this is how black men express themselves when they’re trying to please a woman.  Maybe I’ve misread the whole, brief incident.  Or maybe not.
