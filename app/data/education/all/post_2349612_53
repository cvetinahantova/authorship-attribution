dude, two classes down today, one to go...  prof #1: "so, i don't think i'll finish all the stuff i want to cover this semester in the  two class periods i have left.  let's have an extra class wednesday at 4:30, ok?"  prof #2: "so there are two options... we can have a final, or we can not have a final... which do you prefer?.... ok, majority seems to be voting for no final, so i guess that's that.  less grading for me!" =)  guess who i like better today.
