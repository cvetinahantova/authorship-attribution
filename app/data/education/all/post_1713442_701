urlLink HistoryBuff.com - Presidents  This site features portraits, biographical sketches, trivia, inaugural addresses, and links to related articles.  I really like the easy to use collection of every single Presidential Inaugural addresses.  It also has some other primary source materials from newspapers and historical records.
