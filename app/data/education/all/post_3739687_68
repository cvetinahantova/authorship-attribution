hello,  well i still have a runny nose and i'm coughing up lovely green colored  phlegm.  i'm sure all of you wanted to hear that.  honestly i don't feel bad  so i think it is some sort of allergy thing and not a cold.  i was a good  girl and stayed in last night.  i slept for around 15 hours.  i kept waking  up and putting in a new movie thinking that i wouldn't be able to go back to  sleep but then i would pass back out before i was ten minutes ito the movie.  anyway... i guess i don't really have much to say.  if i still feel like it  i'm going to the weekend market to pick up some things i desperately need.   things out there are cheap and they usually have sizes that fit so i'm going  to go on a huge shopping spree.  i need so many things such as bowls,  plates, cups, lamps, shirts, shoes, etc.   just about anything i buy would  be a huge addition.  well gotta run.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ Get ready for school!
