In your registration packet you should have received information on when and where our Homecoming Activities will be held. If you for some reason have lost this information feel free to contact me at  urlLink alexfor2007@gmail.com . I would prefer you e-mail me rather then having me post the information here because then anyone out there that has internet access could view where certain people live or where a bunch of sophomores are going to be and I think that is a bit of a security risk that I don't want weighing down on my conscience. So if you would like to participate in Homecoming Activities but don't know where or when they are going to be, again feel free to contact me,  urlLink alexfor2007@gmail.com .
