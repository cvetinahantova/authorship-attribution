Weird    urlLink Carbon monoxide poisoning scares me .  It's the new  urlLink radon .      I'm not a praying man, but when I was thirteen, my sunday school teacher made us go around the room and offer a prayer for someone.  My classmates prayed for their parents, siblings, friends, etc., and I prayed for John Candy, who had just died.  At the time I didn't understand why this caused such a titter.  So, those of you who do pray, please pray for Weird Al.  The rest of us will just hope that he doesn't write a song about this experience.  What would be worse:  a satirical send-up of a current pop song about one's parents dying of carbon monoxide poisoning?  Or an earnest ballad about one's parents dying of carbon monoxide poisoning written by  Weird Al Yankovic  ?  If I was him, I'd really be wishing I wasn't him right now, you know what I mean?  No one would take him seriously, or if we did, it would be uncomfortable in the same way that it was uncomfortable when, suddenly, John Ritter was a comedy god simply because he was 1) dead and 2)  we all know his name.    Not to speak ill of the dead, of course.  But sometimes we talk about them like conspicuous eavesdroppers.  And that doesn't seem to be what anyone would want.
