Vending machines are cool. I chucked 200 yen (about $NZ3) into one and a cute little robo kitset fell out. The sword is a bit floppy, but its still a neat little toy.  Some of the electronics stores here have fantastically elaborate kitsets, with huge (and hugely expensive) assault suits available. The Gundam models seem to be the dominant types.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink
