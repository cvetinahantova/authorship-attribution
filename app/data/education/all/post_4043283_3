Countdown: 309 days  Too much has happened in the last three days and I'm too lazy to type everything up. XP I have AON 7 to read. Hehe.  Oh, here's something I wanna say:  Mike  came over to SLA yesterday and gave me a bear he got in Scotland. ^^ Its name is now  Mike  because "Mike" is a damn popular name. Yay~! Hehe.  On a more serious note, I've been thinking a little about my feelings for  Chris  and I've come to a conclusion that I think I can be content with for now. I love him. I may always love him. But even now my love for him isn't as deep as it was before. Maybe with time, it will eventually fade away entirely. For now, though, I have to accept that I love him. And I only hope that he will be happy.  ^^ I feel better. Bai now!
