I would like to go on record in favor of a PC user's license.  Some people, you must be aware, have NO business owning a computer, much less one that functions.  Maybe you and I are different than they are, maybe we spent our time playing video games as a child not just in awe of the flashing lights, but also thinking about how the thing worked.  Maybe we thought that video games were much like personal computers (when they finally went mainstream).  Maybe we drew parallels that make computer use easy for us that they somehow did not draw.   Maybe they're dumb.   I'm not kidding, if I have to reinstall the OS of some dumbass friend of mine ONE MORE TIME...Seriously, people!  Get an antivirus program!  Use it (this may mean spending a little more than the BARE MINIMUM when buying the PC, because more memory might be necessary for your eMachine to run more than one program at a time without exploding)!   And I'm done :)
