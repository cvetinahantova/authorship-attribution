Relatively interesting day. Went to the 'Intellectual' museum here in Ulaanbaatar. Turns out it doesn't quite match the description. It is in fact a puzzle and toy museum with various stuff from around the world mixed with the puzzles and drawings made by the owner, who is very keen to show off his brilliance. He must be hell to live with.  Well frankly I hate puzzles. I don't have the right kind of brain for them and they normally just frustrate and/or bemuse me. It's all too Belgian!!! Being a philosopher at heart I prefer problems and solutions to be posited simultaneously in a philosophical decision. All this deductive stuff is for logicians. Nevertheless it was a rather interesting cultural experience and his daughter(?) who did the translating was quite attractive (which helped!). Ended up buying something to be polite.  On the way back Rg pointed out the old Mongolian parliament building, which is not much bigger than a typical English village hall.
