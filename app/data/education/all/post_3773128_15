Saturday 3.00a.m  Was preparing myself for bed.  Had a fun night in Cyber Jaya. After all, this is the last time I attend the cell group. I doubt that I'll be joining it again six years later when I come back from Korea.  Saturday 5.00a.m  Arrggg!!!! There was this unbearable pain in my stomach. My intestine and stomach was squirming inside, turning and twisting here and there.  "Never mind, get back to sleep, this is just another nightmare." I was telling myself.  "How can my stomach hurt so much unless I'm dreaming. After all,I think I had this dream before, few weeks ago."  Never the less, the pain never decreased. It was getting worse and worse.   " O God! Stop this pain! I know if You're willing to You can!"   Yet there was another "suggestion" that arose in my mind, "Look, the balcony is just a few steps from you and it's not closed, just jump down from it. You'll just die and be in heaven and the pain will be gone. Isn't that wonderful?"  This suggestion seemed so tempting that I was actually considering it. Yet before I could take any action, another idea pop up in my mind : " Just take some panadols. It's a pain killer. It will take care of the pain."  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  And so I knocked at my grandma's room and asked her for some panadols. Yet it didn't do much good.  As my aunt and grandma was going to the doctor that morning, I went with them and got the confirmation from the doctor that I had food poisoning.  And thus the last Saturday that I could roam around in KL was spent taking medicine and resting at home.
