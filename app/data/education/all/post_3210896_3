Well, today is the last full-day of school for the students, and the next-to-last full day for the faculty. It's crazy here. I've got computers ALL OVER my room, and I've got to get them all back in place in two days. Yeah, I can see that happening. More like I see myself working again this Saturday ... without OT pay.  Lovely.  We got to see a few of the teenagers graduate last night. What an awesome accomplishment for them. I can't believe I've been around these guys as long as I have. What will hurt is when the kids from Children's Church graduate...yikes. Between that, and my daughter growing like a weed, no wonder I have gray hairs popping up.  Life, ain't it grand?
