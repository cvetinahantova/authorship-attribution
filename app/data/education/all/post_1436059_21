My carpet is wet.  Why?  I live in a walled-off, warm, cozy room in the basement. While I was at Tae Kwon Do last night, the huge storm that passed over Central Maryland and many other places beside flooded my city. Flooded. Since the law states that every bedroom has to have two emergency escape routes, and I'm underground, I have one door leading upstairs and one door leading to a stairwell outside in my backyard. That damn backyard door leaked water into my room. Dammit.  I'm totally done wallowing in my self-pity for now, because I got to sleep in this morning. I am becoming a night bird. I continually stay up past midnight and one oclock to wait for someone on the BDs to post, and the next morning I sleep in until twelve noon.   Gramma is getting better, but she finds out this Sat. when she starts chemo.   I saw Pirates of the Carribean last night. It was an AWESOME movie. I loved Jack Sparrow (Depp), and how he walked, talked, and planned like he was perpetually drunk. Awesome. Orlando Bloom was alright, but I didn't care for him much. CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow ROCKS MY WORLD! J/K. :-)
