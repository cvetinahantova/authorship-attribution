You know, I've seen people do this 'blog' thing before and it always intrigued (sp?) me.  I think journaling is so great, but is it really something you want everyone to be able to see?  I suppose.....naturally..... I'm not going to put anything on here if I mind someone reading.  Anyhow, this might be fun.  Besides- I don't journal half as much as I should.  This is convenient.  Plus--- I'm a much faster typer than I am a writer.   If you are reading these 'blogs' (that's such a strange name-- it reminds me of those scary puppets my brother used to have.... what were they called?  boglins?  boggles?)... Anyhow- if you are going to read these, I should warn you that they are going to be little snippits of my life and my thoughts.  Pretty much-- they are not going to be jammed full of excitement.  Well, you know- I shouldn't say it's not going to be exciting stuff....  Hmmm......... It's going to be real.  How about that?  Real funny.  Real boring.  Real feelings.  And  Really  full of grammatical errors ;-)  Alright..... enough for now.  I think I may email Gen to tell her I'm thinking of doing this and I've actually taken the first steps.  My first blog (*awwwwwww*).  Goodnight.  One more day of testing!  yey!!!!  (Lucy is asleep on my lap with her head over my arm while I'm trying to type.  What a cutie patootie.)
