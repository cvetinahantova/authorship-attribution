Arghh... Two tuitions in the same day. Can you believe it? Physics and Add Math. Damn bloody tiring. Summore stayed at friends place for awhile after my afternoon physics class to do project. And nothing came out. Chatted most of the time. Didn't exactly do a lot of work. Had a nice time chatting though. Damn troublesome this physics project. En.Ariff thinks that we're rocket scientists or something. Do three experiments for your project. Ask him how to do it this is how he will reply with his accent, 'I already gave you the instructions and the formulas. It is up to you to work it out.' No fireworks, no chemical reactions, no ready made stuff.. All construct on your own. Nice and friendly teacher but NASTY... If experiment failed, straight away 15 marks deducted. No comments. SSC...  Anyways, changed my layout again. The last one was rather shitty. At least this looks better. Got SOME people trying to get me to join xanga. More skins, can add media player and more codes. No way man! Im sticking to blogspot. If not, Ill build my own site than joining xanga. hahaha... Im still working on my pictures section. Cant seem to get the perfect size to fit into my sidebar. Photobucket sux in resizing pics. Unfortunately, i don have adobe or any other photo editing programs. So, having some probs now.   Haven't completed any of my projects yet. Gona have a rough week when school reopens. Spent all my time on workin on this blog. Terrible... Tryin to buck up. Summore got my debate. Not yet prepare anything yet. Oh wellz.. Im not speaking. Just sitting at the corner figuring rebuttals for my team. Ahh.. Should be ok i guess.. Time net sux btw. Stupid internet service. Gives you problems all the time. And its freakin expensive! Only uses it when my Jaring has got some prob. 56k sux. Area no steamyx. Using Maxis line for my house phone. I like Maxis though. Service quite good. As in.. If your phone line got some prob, they come right away. Thats why i like 'em... compared to Telekom which takes ages... *yawns* ... Gtg now..kinda sleepy adi. Fook out...
