The trip was wonderful...  The people ever better. The group from Philly was awesome. I will definatly be getting back out there to see them. But for now, know that I am doing well, and that I'm safe, and that I'm in Hafia doing Shabbat with a friend and his family. More to come after the next 25 hours :-)
