I have very rarely enjoyed shopping. Sometimes I liked it as a kid and sometimes I like going to thrift stores but generally I have never really loved it.  I have though always had this mental image that occasionally pops up in dreams and sometimes even in daydreams.  It is one of me shopping joyfully. I walk down the aisles tossing this and  that into a big cart, a tune by Pancho Sanchez is playing and every move I make is in time with the music, all the other shoppers are also choreographed so turns at the end of the aisles are very breathtaking. It really is sort of like a big dance number where everybody is happy and carefree. I have I realize seen this in films at least once but never like I vision it inside my head. Sometimes I wish life seemed more like that where everyone seemed happy and danced around to a tropical beat that perpetually played in their head.   Maybe that is what Brazil is like because the pop music from there always seems so happy. Even the more downtempo stuff from that culture has this underlying feeling of relaxed joy.
