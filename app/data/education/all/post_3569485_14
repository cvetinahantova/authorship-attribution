Wow!! I am really bord right now. I am leaving for my cousins in like an hour or something and I have nothing to do! I went to the doctor this morning, the doctor that did my surgery.. and he told me that i still have 7-10 days until i am completely healed. I am so pissed because he told me that tomorrow.. which is the two week mark, would be the time that I would be completely healed. So....
