I'm in the library @ skool!  This is really hard to write though, since the librarian is sitting right behind me and the only time we're supposed to use the school email is to send things home, or if we're asked to do something.  Gracie, you said you posted by emailing i think, but it doesn't seem to have turned up. When you write the emails it seems that you have to use the 'plain text' setting for it to work. Anyway, i'm rambling.  We're supposedly writing a plan and our observations for a science experiment, but i really really don't feel like working. And also this spell-checker thing is driving me crazy with all its stupid capital 'I's and doesn't think i should have two 'really's next to each other. I'm still rambling.  Well, i can't really write an awful lot since this might get 'intercepted'! Hee hee! Damn, it doesn't know the word 'hee' either. Eek!!  Oh, i'm so bored.
