Since the first day I came here, I've been asking God to give me a friend whom I can really relate to. And last night I've just met one. But ironically, he'll be having his holidays soon while I'll be away for my camp and I'm flying off in 3 weeks time.  I was having dinner with Wei Sian last night. We were talking there after dinner when  he  came to have his dinner as well. Seeing that he was alone, I "forced"  him  to join us. The three of us were just talking and debating about praying for our food, going into mission, doing devotions etc etc etc. Wanting to spend more time  together, the two of us went for ABC after dinner. And I guess that was when our relationship started to build.  Yet deep within I can't hide the fact that I feel sad because here is someone whom I really like, whom I can share my thoughts with,whom I can relate to, but we'll be heading separate paths soon. I don't understand. If God wanted us to be friends, why not sooner? Why now? But who am I to question God. He's timing is never wrong.   His  experience is that  he  got closer with  his  former friends after being apart. Yet from my experience it's the other way round.  Well, may be as he'd said:"We'll meet in heaven."
