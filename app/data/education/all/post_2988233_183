In fact, she just left my house with mud all over her feet.lol.  She is 100% better today than she was the other night.  She was running, playing, talking, just our normal little Savannah.   When Noah saw her, he was out of the bus with my brother (brother and his partner are converting a tour bus into a motor coach beside my house) and he came running in the house screaming "vanna's home, vanna's home, come see, vanna's home"  He was so excited to see her.    I didn't realize how worried him and all this brothers had been.  But she is home and playing in the mud.  Happy days are here again.
