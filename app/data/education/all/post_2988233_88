For some reason, when I link to my blog from another one, my last few posts aren't showing up.  I wonder why.    Ok, I was please with American Idol tonight.  Really glad that JPL went instead of Diana, Should have been red John, I bet he goes next week.  The apprentice, well, I was pulling for Quamie, I really wanted  him to win, but stupid Omarosa did him in.  He should have fired her, he should have done it, and enjoyed it.  She is such a mean spirited woman.  And lie, whoa, that woman can lie to you with sugar dripping off her tongue.    I'm bed bound.  I have to clean Tommy's work in the morning, and Have to get up early, so, it will be a rough day.  They are having a visit from someone with the Polaris company, so it has to be REALLY clean.
