I've gotten into my classroom and things are being unpacked and placed in a certian spot. (However I know I will move it about 100 times to try different arrangements) I have chosen a theme, Bears and patriotic. It's similar to my past room, however I have MORE bear things this year!  As of now I'm contemplating different things to do to my room... I was debating about making a cave for the reading center, like one the kids would be sitting in while they read. I was wanting to have stalagtites and stalagmites to help make it even more educational. Besides I figure bears sleep in caves so it would be a nice connection. I also was thinking about what all I need for each center. It's amazing how many things you can come up with for kids to learn with. Anything from different games or manipulatives to neat ways to organize materials for kids to want to work with it.  I'm very excited because I have a key for my room and one for the outside of my school so I can come anytime I want to work on it! (o:  When I was going through my old things from Johnson I saw things from my past class and almost cried cause I miss them and think they were great. It was neat because I knew all of their personalities and remembered happy memories with them.  I guess I just can't wait for school to start and get new kiddos and memories...
