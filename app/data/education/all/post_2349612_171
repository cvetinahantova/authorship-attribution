just woke up to a phone call from paul (aka crazy crutch guy to some... he's not on crutches anymore though =P)... the first thing out of his mouth was "so when's church at your church tonight and tomorrow and how do you get there because i'm going even if you can't....."  he talks too fast... i had to make him repeat 3 times before i was awake enough to digest what had come out of his mouth.  apparently i'm giving paul a ride to church today (maundy thursday) and tomorrow (good friday).  this shall be interesting.  for easter though, the weiss's are adopting me for the day again... i like this =)  now time to get my class on... then homework til it's time to go... joy.  later dudes.
