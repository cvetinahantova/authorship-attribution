Today I went to Church for a teen Christmas Project. All the Middle Schoolers and four of us High Schoolers (even though it was supposed to be a HS thing in the first place *rolls eyes*) came to Church and made pretty bags and filled them with donated goodies for the people less fortunate during the holiday season. Then we made disgusting sandwiches made of rye bread, mustard, some mix between salami and bologna, and nasty cheese. Yummy.  I'm so tired.   It's supposed to rain/sleet/ice/snow on Sunday, so hopefully we won't have any school. That's an A day so I really hope we don't have school. I love B days.
