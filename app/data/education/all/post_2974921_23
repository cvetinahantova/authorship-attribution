i'm so bad...and in love............kinda nice, i must admit......  i lied to raxzeez, or whatever his name is, about my rudeness. i said it wasn't me. it's just that he said he was disppointed with me and i was affected by that. do i really care? i don't know.....  jammi and i had a great conversation yesterday. i found out he's a really deep person. he says stuff no ordinary 15-year-old would think of. his theories and opinions makes me feel like i'm so ignorant. it seems like he looks at things so thoroughly and he thinks wel of them. i really find him interesting.....charming and sweet. we chatted the whole morning, unfortunately, i wasn't able to get backat him after my lunch because my bro used the computer. isaid i'll be back, i wonder if he's mad. i also found out a couple of things about him which were supposed to be secrets. he said he just felt like he could tell me anything. he said he trusted me and i did feel like i was trusted. well, jammi, i won't let you down[oi, rexona!].  anyway, he told me he was clairvoyant. jammi told me it was really a dark side to him. he told me he dreamt ofhis grandfather's death and the presidential thing of FPJ. lately, he dreamt of a guy being shot. i felt kinda honored to be the first to know that. he also had a lot of theories. like when i asked him if he believed in ghost, he didn't really answer my question but told me that ghosts are passed on not created. you know, when genes and memories are passed on to other generations, the present get glimpses of the past, assuming they're ghosts. pretty deep, huh? he also told me he was born critical. oh and he sent me a sample of his beatboxing. wow, it rocked! i also told him about the time i fell from the second floor balcony, man, was he shocked. hahaha!  aww....i miss him....  bahala na....  it's been a while since i said that.....
