Just some more thoughts rambling through my head... I listened to a spiel on npr about blogging today that said the best sites are run/maintained by bloggers with a distinct "voice" - something opinionated on their minds.  Ok, my opinion of the day is that my government is the worst I've seen it during my lifetime and I'm really hoping for a change this fall.  My policies are better than our leaders' and I'm a flippin' GEOLOGIST!  I'm thoroughly disgusted by the current administration. I think they're greedy, self-serving, insular frat boys - the foxes got into the chicken coop and are feasting with little dispute from anyone outside.  More soon...
