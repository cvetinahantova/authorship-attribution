I just got done watching  Shrek 2  with Gabe, it's funny. I think he has seen it three times now but he still wanted to see it with me. That was really neat of him to want to hang out with his big sister tonight, I haven't had a chance lately to be that to him.  My brothers and my dad ended up watching  Dance With Me   last night, yes I watched it again, they loved it too. I was thinking though that I wonder if it could be possible to be able to dance with arthritis, I mean I wonder if my joints would get too worn out. I love to dance and I would give anything to just go and dance without the worry of not being able to walk in the morning. Daddy says that some people can believe or want something so much that they can make it happen. I want to believe, I want to dance, I want to run, jump and play. That's not impossible is it? It's not just a dream, God is way bigger than I. I know it.
