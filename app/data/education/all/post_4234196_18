I have had a couple people write regarding blogs and how you get started with one.  I am using:   urlLink http://www.blogger.com/start   There are no fees or anything for this blogger.  Just click on a "Create a Blog" link and get started.  If anyone has any questions, let me know.  If a couple of us or more start blogs regarding PP16, we could try to webpage them for easy locating.
