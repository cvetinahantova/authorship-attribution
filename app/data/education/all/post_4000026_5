Yeap...yet again my services in NCC is required.Not to train, rather more of motivating them, telling every unit that they are good and they should bring out their best. Well as for Alex... I can understand his situation when he needs to get things right, howeer my suggestion to him is to keep a smile and lets things flow fluently and in the right manner. So in the end everyone wins. Well I'll certainly pray for the company(all uniform groups) and of course the brave souls of Shi Min to give her very best this coming National day. Like I promised them I will be there to advise them to make it a more thrilling and enjoyable parade to witness.Go people! =)   Oh and Mr razak has approved my services to help Band in footdrill. He made it sound so grand though...I kinda liked it in fact.lol. Well well enough of boasting about myself, now I wanna focus more on the company and parade. I hope I am able to satisfy their standard on the day itself. Well I gotta go get something to eat I'm starving! Lol peace out ya'll!
