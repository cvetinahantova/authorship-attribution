Well, it was bound to happen, I guess.  Last summer I was told that my cousin had a "blog"....not quite knowing what that was, I wasn't sure if I should be concerned or not!  After logging on to his blog and seeing what a really cool thing it is, I thought I might one day try it and never gave it another thought. My cousin was a total computer freak.  He knew everything there was to know.  While I like to think I am pretty good, I had no clue how to do this.....  Life gets to us sometimes, you know?  We all get busy and times just flies by and of course, I never did get around to trying to figure out how to be a "blogger".   Now we fast forward to April of this year when this same dear cousin of mine suddenly passed away at age 35.  Now I was forced to stop and think about some things. I realized  that life is just way too short.  And, yes, I had read his blog, but had I called my cousin?  Had I sent a card or an e-mail?  No....and now I can't. And yet, even with that kind of wake up call I find myself still being too busy to stay in close contact with those who are the most important to me.  I vow to do better.  Not a day has passed since that April morning when we lost my cousin that I have not cried for him, his little girl, his wife and his parents and brother.  Our family will never be the same again.  But I do know that we must take time to connect with others, even though we are too busy and life is crazy most of the time.  Because, I have sadly learned, when they are gone, it is too late. So, for you Jeremy, I too, will be a blogger!
