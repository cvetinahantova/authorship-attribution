But what should people do if they don't have the perfect employer?   Take for instance, elementary school teachers. They have to take care of 25-30 seven year olds from 8am-4pm, five days a week. Most school teachers don't have any other adult in the room. If they have to use the bathroom, they must wait until their 30 minute lunch break or until the kids leave at 4pm. Most don't have a phone in their room. Some have computers, but schools have firewalled most sites to protect the children. So you usually can't access private email. Most teachers work from about 7 in the morning until 6pm at night, grading, scheduling, and organizing. The average teacher makes in the low to mid $30s, which works out to be $12-14/ hour, once you've taken out taxes, insurance, and certification fees.
