HAHAHA..... First time ever doing a blog....hmmm...quite innovative.anyway,i'm using it as a diary to qut down the different things happening in my life.  For anyone who wants to know who i am... My name is Mingwei or you can call me Israel. That's my baptism name! Serious! It's real! I'm a school PE teacher, not that I look like one..haha...especially with my tummy now. I'm only 26 years old this year. Plus, the pride of my life now is my new girlfriend,Eileen! She's a beautiful and lovely girl! And she is really a lover of God..that's what really draws me to her. She has been a blessing to me!  Anyway, I'm teaching in Yu Neng Primary School...a walking target in the school...everyday nothing to do, just wait to get arrowed by the senior teachers. I guess that's life working in the secular world..being new on the block... hai... Can't wait for Saturday to come....super long weekend due to National Day...hahahaha
