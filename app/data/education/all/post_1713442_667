urlLink Jefferson's Children : The Story of One American Family   This book is by Shannon Lanier.  It is reviewed by Julie Lorenzen.  From the site:  Shannon Lanier, author of Jefferson's Children: The Story of One American Family, has always wanted to tell people that he is the sixth great-grandson of Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings. However, until recently, he has had trouble getting people to believe him. The idea that a descendant of a slave is related to our third U.S. President has been controversial. It also didn't help that Lanier's family didn't have any historical documents to back up their claim because records of slaves are rare.  For example when Lanier, who is black, stood up on President's Day and told his first-grade class he was a descendant of Thomas Jefferson, his teacher called him a liar. The history books did not recognize the relationship between Hemings and Jefferson and all Lanier had as proof was an Oral History passed down from generation to generation.  More solid proof arrived on October 31, 1998, when the Associated Press broke the news of the DNA findings linking Thomas Jefferson to Sally Hemings through the Eston Hemings line. On November 10, Oprah united members of the Jefferson family and the descendants of three lines of the Hemings family. During the show, writer Lucian K. Truscott IV, a Jefferson descendant, invited his Hemings cousins to a family reunion that May at Monticello. Eighteen-year-old Shannon, then a college freshman at Kent State University, saw the show and accepted the invitation.
