well, now janelle is staying at kelsi's house tonight. I really hope those two are having fun with themselves. You know, even when me and scott were inseperable and chilled non-stop, i don't think we had 3 night sleep overs, except when we went to the beach. I wouldnt be surprised if they had another sleep over tomorrow night even thought im going to a senators game with janelle and we wont be home till like 10-11. We'll probably pick kelsi up on the way home. Im at the point that I don't care about it now. Im going to bretts this weekend so they can do whatever they want. This has been the gayest week i've ever had in my life. I can't wait till janelle wants to hang out next week. Yea, so this is all I have to say about today, update tomorrow night. Peace
