I´m just about ot start a new webdiary, which is, let´s say quite difficult since my life doesn´t have too much to say. But anyway, work is coming to an end and so is my money... This is sad, especially if you start thinking about that pair of shoes needed or wanted so much as well as the bills to be paid. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! News: I want to start a diet. I just need to find the right day along with the stars and the moon.  News 2: I guess I´ll be looking for something better. Peole say I can make money. I´ll believe it...
