The storm clouds rolled in yesterday They were there in the blink of an eye At first I thought them exciting, something new, a break from the light But as they steam rolled through the sky Their dinge flattening the color of the world The volcano of darkness began to well up in side me I poured water on my fears hoping to cool them And four a while the darkness lay dormant Till the clouds began to roar with pride The deep rumblings broke the crust and allowed the lava to flow through me I began to burn from the inside out.  As I fell to the ground all hope lost a rray of light pierced the thick dark clouds The light enveloped the darkness inside me using it for it's purpose. But before it did it asked me if it was okay. Was it okay? I weighed my options did I want to be ruled by the anger and hatred and uneding fear that this dark volcano caused or did I want to give in to the light. This light that shone through me whether I was going to follow it's agenda or not. This light that not only engulfed the darkness in me but allowed me to dispell darkness from others. This light that freed me from the bondage of the darkness?  Of course it was okay. Now the darkness in side has subsided and is daily being erraticated by the light.  The clouds still role in and out and clap and roar with pride But the difference is that now they fear the light inside me. I don't fear the darkness inside them.
