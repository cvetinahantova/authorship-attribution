Back with the promised blow-by-blow of the night from hell a little later.  The expected fireworks were minimal.  Until then...  Ever see that new Chef Boyardee commercial?  The one with the cute little girl and her mom shopping at the supermarket?   Mom asks her daughter, "What do you want for dinner tonight?"  Daughter grabs a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli from the shelf, but Mom vetoes the choice, explaining "you've had Chef every night this week."  Daughter whines a little, lays down a helluva pout, but obediently puts the can back on the shelf.  Then, of course, things get odd and the can rolls off the shelf, out the market door, through the parking lot, down the road, up the street, and into the little girl's house, coming to rest against her foot (much to her delight).  Sentient pasta = creepy.  What's more disturbing, though, is Mom's reason for the "no."  Someone call social services!  What kind of parent feeds his/her kid Chef Boyardee for dinner  every night??     Nevermind.   I  would probably feed my kids the stuff every night.
