Today was spent by beginning a new job search which began at the South Carolina Unemployment Commission.  I found out about an entry level quality assurance position with a company in Simpsonville.  Hey, didn't we just move from Simpsonville?  I filled out the application and got set up for an interview on Wed at 9:15 am.  Hopefully my resume wont scare them off and hopefully they will offer me a job.  I figure that 9.00 per hour is better than 7.50 on unemployment benefits any day of the week.    I also went by the TATE TEMPORARIES in downtown Greenville and filled out an application.  They apparently have some clerical work that I might be able to do on a temporary basis.  Ya never know....  I found out this weekend that Walmart also has a phone number you can call and apply for a job online.  I also went by Kinkos by Haywood Mall area and got my resume and cover letter copied onto resume quality paper.    Now, I am going to Mauldin SC to bowl in my Monday night league.  I think we are in fourth or fifth place and we have one or two more weeks to bowl and then this league will be over.
