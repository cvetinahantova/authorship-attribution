Ok so I just wanted to let everyone know...Lance Armstrong is my new hero.  He participates in one of the most grueling sports in all of the sporting world.  He completely DOMINATES cycling like no one else.  Even in other sports, not one single person or team has shown as much dominance as he has.  He's won the premiere event in his sport 5 straight times...and he's in route to 6 straight times.   He's revitalized a sport that no one in the US probably had even heard or cared about.  The thing that is the most impressive...this man is exhibiting all his dominance after surviving three different types of cancer.  He was diagnosed with all three types at the same time, and not once did he give up.  Unbelieveable.  He has returned to full form if not better than he was before his sicknesses. This is quite possibly the greatest comeback story ever.  If you want a story about not giving up and striving for your goals, look no further than Lance Armstrong.  I have the utmost respect and admiration for him.   Lance Armstrong is truly an inspiration story for everyone.
