I love when that happens. Even if you don't really know the friend because you haven't met, it's nice to know that people care about what you do and what you think.  I love my friends. They are all so wonderful.  And I want to learn how to post pictures so that B. doesn't feel as if he needs to say a lot. Pictures are just as important and words. I'd like to share some of my pictures with people. I'll work on that.
