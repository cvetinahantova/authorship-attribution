Every now and then I am reminded of just how lucky I am to know everyone here.  I stood in line for Millennium Force and between the times I was having fun, I noticed the people standing around.  I saw the guy with the hat turned to the side who was pimping two fine looking girls who were wearing Old Navy clothing and also had lip piercings.  I saw human body art that made several people look like freakin murals.  I saw tight-assed people who stood bored and out of it just waiting to get on the ride NOW.  And then, I turn to my group and we were dancing, talking, and messing around in line.  Now, I don't want to ruin what was fun by raising it up, but I wasn't bored in line because I was with people who kept it interesting.
