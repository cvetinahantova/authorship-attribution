So I got up at 10 and watched the various TV shows that I have on my TiVo.  If you can swing it, I suggest a TiVo with urgency.  Television is a wasteland, and though it is now more diversified than ever, it is also so much more abhorrent.           But that's not to say that television is irredeemable.  There is good TV.  Obviously, most shows that are created and aired by non profit organizations are worthwhile.  For instance, I find The Newshour with Jim Lehrer to be the best nightly news program on American TV.  And I have no doubt that it is because of the fact that the Newshour is on PBS, which is not beholden to sponsorship dollars from any sort of advertisement that results in money changing hands and benefiting the advertiser.  Certainly there are sponsors (members of the public, including corporations that are mentioned on the air), but they don't sponsor PBS for profit.           The TV shows you find on HBO and some of the other pay channels (like comedy central and the cartoon network) can also be quite good.  And this is again because of a diminished dependence on advertising dollars from corporate sponsors.  In HBO's case, it is only beholden to its subscribers, who pay to see the unrated workings of the mafia, funeral homes and now the old west.           So you need TiVo to sift through the detritus and capture all the little bits of quality TV.  Even with TiVo, searching through all of the TV in the Cablevision middle package, I record maybe six hours of TV a day.  And I watch maybe two hours, because the rest is reruns of shows that I have already seen, but TiVo has been programmed to record.         But the best thing about TiVo is that you don't have to watch commercials.  I truly believe that the unbelievable flood of advertising into the collective human psyche every day is responsible for a lot of the truly fucked up ethic that is at play in this country and in the world today.  The desire to consume and profit seems to be at an apex.          Anyway, don't think I don't notice the irony of the above, which reads like a TiVo add.  And it is.  But it's an add for the idea of TiVo, not the actual TiVo device itself.  If it was called SpunkOut, I'd be pushing the SpunkOut hardcore.    That's what you get when you sell out the public airwaves.
