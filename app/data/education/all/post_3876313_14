I seem to remember hearing that it will get better when you are done with the first trimester.  Well, I have always thought my due date was a little off.  I think I am really due on the 26th of Feburary.  The fact that I threw up four times already today seems to lead me to believe I am right.  We shall see.....  We haven't done much this weekend.  We went walking twice. And we just got done watching "Cheaper By The Dozen".  Yeah, we won't be having 12 kids.  That was out of control.    I am really looking forward to next weekend when pre-season football games are on.  GO VIKINGS!!!
