Frustrating day.. I don't wish to use my blog as an avenue to comment on people.. But whatever it is, i thank my colleagues for making my day brighter..Sometimes feel that working life is so much better than studying.. Except that when i'm working, i have a tendency to snack more.. which means that i'm growing fat!!      Not like in NP.. Everyday must climb mountains to reach classrooms haha.. I believe when NP was built, it was with that mission in mind:- To stay healthy..             --*..Tip of the day: Climb more mountains..*--
