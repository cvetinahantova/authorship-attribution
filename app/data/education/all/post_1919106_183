Yesterday I had to drive to Toronto to attempt to fix my dad's laptop (which ended up not needing fixing). Now, I left a bit early, and halfway there I realized that I'd be 1/2 hour early. I didn't want to wait for that long so I was pondering what to do. By then I was approaching Halton Hills, which cradles the 401 and offered a really nice view every time I passed. I had also recently spotted a lake in the vincinity, and it all looked gorgeous with lush green fields and all. So I took a detour. Boy, was I happy I did! It's an absolutely exhilarating drive. The uphill is nice, but the downhill is where it really shines - it's practically a mountain pass, snaking down from the top. And for the time it lasted, it really made me forget about all the other crap going on these days (which I won't talk about - I want to keep the blogosphere nice and happy).  I didn't get a chance to visit the lake, but I'm thinking of going this weekend for a leisurely evening of nice driving and perhaps even a picnic. Yeah, that's something I haven't done in a while, which is really a shame, because there's lots of great places for that in the area.  Damn, all this food talk made me hungry. And wanting a beer. A  urlLink Grasshopper  to be precise.
