I f**king told him   So, Morgan was all pissed off yesterday because I went to the Lotus Cup last night instead of playing in his little AD&D game. Even though I told him the first time that Wednesdays wasn't a good idea because if the pack goes to the Cup then so am I. I gave him fair warning, and I regret nothing... it was a very entertaining night yesterday at the Cup.
