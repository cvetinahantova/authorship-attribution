Just nothing   It's weird, I met a long lost friend through the friendster site. We sent messages through the sites then we decided just to text each other. We became textmates. Just as we were getting to know more of each other a topic weird as can be made a good effect on me. (I don't know to her but we were closer than we were-my presumption) We had an argument with regards to meeting. We were really not that friends during our college days but we knew each other. Only that her previous boyfriend and I were dormates (thinking of a good relationship or in this case a good connection - whew). So the text war broke and its all about me being a complete stranger to her and the other legal facts about it but for me it's bearable. The sad part came when she stopped texting me so I felt bad because I offended her. Actually she said so with her last text. My words might be offending  but my intentions were not. Some of my girl-friends thinked the same way. I was wrong. And I admit I was wrong. And I asked forgiveness. After two weeks, the angels were sent and gave me all the details on how I could contact her. To date, I have talked to her at work, at home, and even saw her during her duty and brought dinner. The weird thing is that, It felt so good. As if I won in the million peso lottery (pero sana nga-kahit hindi ako tumataya). Previously I had sleepless nights,now it became worst awake even until 3 in the morning just thinking of her. Talking about weird things. But this time its a very good feeling. Weird feeling. I admit, I am weird. But I liked it.to sum it up. I think I like her.
