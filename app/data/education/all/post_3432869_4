I received my placement, FINALLY!  Miyagi-ken it is.  Yes, just like Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid!  I can't quite seem to understand why they are still so vague at this point in the game.  First, all you know is that you are going to Japan.  Then, they narrow it down to a prefecture.  Someday, I'll know what city.  Miyagi-ken is pretty far up the northeast coast.  From what I can gather online, they must have 4 seasons and at least some snow fall.  Darn it, I swore I wouldn't be around for another Wisconsin winter.  That may be true, but I'm afraid that Japan's winter is going to be just as bad for me... especially without central air or heat.  Hello down coat, heating pads, and electric blankets!  Hopefully, I will hear from my contracting organization fairly soon and I'll have a lot of questions answered.    I told everyone at work that I was leaving today as well.  What a relief!  I had heard some people talking about me leaving and I know it sounds morbid, but I felt like they were planning my funeral before I was gone.  I felt so much better that it was out in the open.  Funny thing is, no one had said a thing to me.  That is, besides Nancy or Stephen of course, because I had already told them I was going to Japan.  But it just sort of says something about the people that I work with.  I also heard that Natalie, a girl I don't care for at all, will be leaving in August, so that takes her out of the running for my job.  Thank goodness.  My customers deserve so much better!   Well, I need to be gearing up for a more positive energy and some drastic life changes.  I'm so excited and so ready for a new challenge that will surely push me to my limits and allow me to see what this girl is made of.  Stay tuned!  Ja (see you later in Japanese)!
