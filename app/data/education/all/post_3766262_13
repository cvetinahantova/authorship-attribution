I thought teaching was supposed to get easier the more years you tack onto your resume. How wrong I am. Today I was handed the most demanding schedule of classes I´ve had yet, large portions of literature text books from the 80´s (which were sucky for kids even when they were new), and a book titled  Literature from England, Classics for Christians .     In the large, intimidating grammer book, there are complete passages from the bible, so that we Christianity can be pushed as we discuss sentence structure.  Ah! Needless to say, I will be using those book sparingly at best. Am I really in a place where Harry Potter is banned, and there are no class sets of novels? Yes, yes I am.  The upside- I still like it here. People are fabulously accommodating- to both my novel requests and my poor, tired Spanish. I´ll be loaded with planning, but I anticipate it getting easier- glad I traveled when I could. Though, you know me; I´ll make time for myself, my pleasures outside of students (whom I do genuinely love) if it kills me!  Soon however, I will need some alone time- there has been none so far. I feel a creative, solitary urge coming on. Hopefully it´ll soon be satisfied.  Kids come on Thursday- Ah!
