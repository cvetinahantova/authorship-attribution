My core realization for my period of blog inactivity is that I must continue to be a vocal advocate of personal liberty (as brilliantly articulated by Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and others).     If these sages' ideas are lost to the sands of time and freedom becomes equated with modern progressivism/collectivism, then society will be damaged in myriad more ways. We owe it to ourselves to protect our individual liberties and retain faith in the inner good of humanity. Were we to reach a point where society were "fixed" through compulsory means, I doubt that most of us would be happy with such an outcome.     The tyranny of a popular majority is not inherently better than the tyranny of dictatorship. In fact, a benevolent dictator would likely be preferable to the deconstruction of the rule of law via democracy.
