I am happy to say that Yahoo has finally added my  urlLink personal home page  and my  urlLink Library Instruction  site to their directory.  They can be found in the  urlLink Society and Culture > People > Personal Home Pages > L   category and the  urlLink Reference > Libraries > Professional Resources > Library Instruction   category.  I have been trying for years to get these added.  Unfortunately, my submissions have been ignored until now.  (And I refused to pay $299 to get my sites reviewed. Why should I?  They are not commercial...) I guess the moral of this story is if you are willing to keep submitting a good site to Yahoo, eventually they will add it for free.
