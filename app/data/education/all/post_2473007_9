With mixed emotions I felt death strike     Sitting in a crowded coffee house on a damp night     Surrounded by a city of dead people that smiled and laughed         And spoke of life.   I smiled through the pleasant pain of     Losing some vague connection with an obscure past     Tasting mint espresso and the overwhelming sense of small         And being man.   The falling sky seemed to wash my mind     Of tender stalks of grass or infinitely high trees     Melting away into the dark streets, swept away by the streams         Into a drain.   I hear the laughter and I smell smoke     Curling at the ceiling, not unlike clouds; as a boy     Watching the temporary masterpieces drifting away         Forever gone.   With mixed emotions I felt death strike. With a quiet painless blow, Someone died within.
