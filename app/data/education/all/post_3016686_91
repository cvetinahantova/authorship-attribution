She's  jumped the shark  and become a  urlLink sex columnist on Nerve  (that is not a link for the workplace, FYI). Who does she think she is fooling? Does her new Avril-aged fanbase read Nerve? Regardless, thin Lizzy is no  urlLink Dan Savage  - her column tends toward this kind of statement:   One more thing: I didn't hear you say you loved him. If he's not doing it for you, get a different boyfriend. Find someone you can love, and the sex will be better   Yawwwwn. Someone on the  urlLink Velvet Rope  cleverly suggested that  "the responses to two of the five questions on this link were actually written by The Matrix."  (a bit of an industry joke)
