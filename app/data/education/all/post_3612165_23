African-American  Background This linguistic variety is commonly refered to as Black English (BE), Black English Vernacular (BE), African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), and Inner City English (ICE).  There have been three primary theories regarding the source of African-American English. These three theories can be named the following:  Decreolized Creole  Variety of Southern States English  The "Unified" Theory  Proponents of the decreolized creole theory maintain that African-American English arose from a pidgin that was created among slaves from various linguistic backgrounds, primarily from West Africa. This pidgin included features of both the West African languages and English. Over time, this pidgin developed into a creole, and then more recently, became decreolized, and began to resemble English more closely.  Others state that African-American English is a variety of Southern States English, noting that the two varieties have many features in common, such as the Southern Vowel Shift, vowel lowering, and double modals.  Proponents of the unified theory state that African-American English arose from a number of sources, including West African languages and Southern States English, through a variety of evolutionary tracks.   Features of African-American English African-American English has a number of phonological features, including:  Consonant Cluster Reduction  Realization of /T/ and /D/ as /t,f/ and /d,v/  Vowel Lowering  /z/ -> [d] in Contractions  Monophthongization  R-lessness  Exercises Phonetics  Phonology  International Phonetic Alphabet  Linguistic and Social Variability  Accent Phonology  How Accents Differ  Why Accents Differ  Lexical Sets  Historical Issues  Discourse  http://www.ic.arizona.edu/~lsp/AAEnglish.html
