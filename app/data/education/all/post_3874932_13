In both the survey data and in our sample, curiosity predicts adoption.  More curious people are more likely to adopt.    Traditional adoption and diffusion variable uses a variable called innovativeness. I haven't gotten a chance to look fully at the items that are used in our field for innovativeness, but some of those used in the (not very good) paper I just reviewed sound like curiosity to me.  I think Mary is getting some papers that used the innovativeness construct, so we can take a look and see what we think.   On a related note, Rogers does mention that openness to learning is related to early adoption.  We tried that construct and it factored three ways, so we've used curiosity instead.    So innovativeness, openness to learning and curiosity may measure similar ideas.  I think we can mention all these literatures in our section on curiosity.
