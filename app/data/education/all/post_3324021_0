For a majority of the year I had a picture on my agenda. What I didn't get was why people had such a big deal with it. It's just a picture of one of the greatest men in the world. A man I idolize, a man that I want to be just like when I go out into the world. . . . . Howard Stern.  I love The Howard Stern Show, it truly does brighten my mornings. I listen to the show every morning. I look up to this man. I listen and watch his shows, I have read his books, and seen his movie. He does what I want to do. Like him I want to have a radio show that not only holds my interest of politics, but also ties in my. . . well my more perverted side as those of you that used to sit with me at Pierce girls basketball and volleyball games have seen. I want to do that, have a show with sex and a twist of politics. Talk about a few political topics in the first hour or so, and then have some fun.  A lot of people say Howard degrades women, my mother is one of those people. She doesn't care if I listen to him, but she won't. "Alex! He degrades women!" that's what I get whenever I bring him up, so I just don't talk about him with my mother anymore. My dad doesn't mind talking to me about him though. It was my dad that first introduced me to the show. Lets see. . . it was about. . . um about. . . well it was after 9/11. . . we will say around Summer 2002 I started listening to Howard, yes two years sounds about right. Anyway back to the women's issue I was talking about. Howard doesn't degrade women. It's the women themselves that are degrading women. Howard has never forced a girl to take her top off, they voluntarily do it. You've got all these women complaining about how he degrades women, when it is the women themselves that are degrading their gender!
