My friend and I werent talking for a little while becouse of the fact that she allows her boyfriend to downgrade her and control her life and i myself do not think its right. Okay heres a story for all of you, May 18th I went over to her house w/ my daughter and my boyfriend, we were having a fine time till her boyfriend got home. He gets home and i knew he be mad about whatever it was jamie did wrong again ( i cant even member it was so pathetic) so he comes upstairs to her room and hes all quite, so i dont think anything of it i figured he would wiat till we left before he started bitching at her. WRONG! Jamie (my friend) Told me she would watch the baby so me and my man could go have a smoke. So we go downstairs and out side and like five min. later i hear them yelling. While my daughter was in the same room. So i went up got my daughter and left. I think thats purely disrespectfull i couldnt belive they did that right in front of my child.
