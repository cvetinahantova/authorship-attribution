At my friend's house again. My mom's house was definitely lost, plus 3 of her close neighbours. We're doing ok. I now have to organize this stupid workshop for 200 people on thurs and fri from my motorhome. ugh. We found a new venue and are trying to let everyone know as well as make adaptations to be ready.  So many people are evacuated that it's hard to find teachers who can come and help do the set up.    Thanks for all our good thoughts. We saw mom's house on the news yesterday. it's awful.
