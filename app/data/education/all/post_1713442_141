urlLink â€œBringing Instructional Activities under an Information Literacy Umbrella"  Merry Christmas!  Here is a new information literacy article from  Academic Exchange Quarterly  with full-text online!  Abstract:  "Instructional activities at Joyner Library, East Carolina University, currently include course-integrated instruction, online tutorial use, class web pages, research consultations, a customizable subject guide database, and a writing contest. These instructional activities can be more usefully planned and evaluated with proper program building. With an improved planning process, an Information Literacy umbrella will also allow the instruction librarians to target certain student groups more effectively, specifically incoming first-year students, distance education students, and students who are participating in a new 3-year-to-degree program."
