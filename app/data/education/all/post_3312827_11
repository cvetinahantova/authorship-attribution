Well, here I am... sitting and typing on my new computer.  I feel so high tech and it's so fast!  I could sit here all night.  Thank God Julie was still home to sign for it so I didn't have to go through the b.s. of sending it to the Pleasantville warehouse so I could go pick it up.  Now I just have to wait for the USB cable for the printer and everything will be just fine and dandy.  :)  Dad got really sick from the chemo that he's taking.  He threw up all night the night before last and then threw up once this morning.  Apparently they're going to give him a shot tomorrow so he'll be all right for the weekend.  It really sucks.    Matt called last night... he's been really busy with all that police academy stuff, but it would be nicer hearing him say that he wants to come over and just see me.  Whatever.  I can't worry about that now.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens.  I'm so hungry but my stomach hurts.  What the hell is that all about?  I think I'll go get something to eat.  Till later!
