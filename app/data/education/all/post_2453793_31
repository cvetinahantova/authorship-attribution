so...after 2 long years of thinking about making a blog and a few short-lived attempts...here i am. i've decided that i'm going to let this one ride for a while. i figure that i just need to start slowly. the thing is, i'm not sure i'm ready to share my thoughts with the world. i think the world is too harsh for a dreamer like me. i don't feel like i'm understood, which is probably the best reason to have a blog. i'm not going to let anyone know about this. for a while at least. i think that right now i'd rather have strangers read my thoughts...so here goes nothing...
