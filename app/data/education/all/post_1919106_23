This is not my shit   I went to work today and Evan told me a story that has me very upset. It turns out that Abhi wants the CSClub to clean out the Beowulf Cluster lab because he thinks that having the club sponsor the project is equivalent to releasing all responsibility from CAMS. But it's f*cking NOT! The machines all have goddamn CAMS property tags, and it was made perfectly clear to us that we were borrowing the machines. So excuse me if I'm pissed off when a f*cking CAMS cheap bastage thinks that their money is not good enough to pay someone to move their own shit, which they would have had to pay anyway. We cannot pay for it with our own money, because  that is f*cking illegal  because the money is strictly for the research, not for getting rid of someone else's trash. And we're NOT going to get students to help because if someone gets hurt then we get all the shit. But we're not going to give in that easily. Oh no. If he wants us to move all that f*cking shit fine, we'll move it...  back to where it came from .
