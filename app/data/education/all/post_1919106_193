Well, following on the steps of a major update on  urlLink Blogger  I decided to try some of them new templates here. Things are going to be changing around, until I settle on something I like. There's definitively room for improvement here.   Update: Well, I fixed a few things here and there:    The links are back.  I got comments enabled now, so I'm scrapping the tag-board. It was difficult to follow conversations with that anyway.  I tried resizing the columns, but the template uses images to round off the corners. Unless I edit the images, it would fuck everything up. So until I change that, the width will remain as it is. I got an idea on how to set the corners to resize dynamically, but it's too much fucking work for just a blog, so I'm leaving it as it is.  Colors are fixed now. The previous template looked fine on my monitor, but on other systems the sidebar colors did not match the background color as they were supposed to.   I learned to use fantabulastic bullet-lists now.  I switched over to actually using the title field for post titles. Before I'd do it by hand because the title formatting on the old template was crappy. But now the titles are used on the new template for the archives. I switched the last month or so worth of archives, everything else is still in the old format.   Anyway, here's  urlLink something to break y'all's heads .
