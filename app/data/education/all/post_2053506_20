I brewed some tea with my electric iced tea maker. I used Revolution's Southern Mint Tea.  Five bags for three and a half quarts.  I think it's almost a little too minty, but the tea flavor isn't overpowering, so I think I probably got the measurements right.  I have five of those tea bags left, so when I'm done with this pitcher, I'm going to try the same thing only using the cold infusion method.  Then I'll be able to tell exactly what the differences are. I am looking forward to my little experiment.
