On a very short note, I went to summer school today and was given the opportunity to do the "read-aloud." As I was reading, my Fellowship Advisor came in to observe my classroom skills.   As I read, I asked the kids small questions about what certain words meant, what they thought would happen, or why characters did or said the things they did.    Later today, at our group Fellowship session, we brought up the subject of what the evaluations she would be giving us actually meant in terms of the program, or us becoming teachers. To reassure us, she said that she just wanted to peek in and see how we were relating to the children, and that she would be able to determine that, even if we were only sitting in a chair in the back of the class observing. Then, she said that she feels that some people are just born with an inherent "teacherness" about them. Not that teacherly traits can't be learned, just that if you were someone who needed to learn them, she wanted us to know and then help us accomplish that.   At the end of the session, she went over the observations she had from today's summer school classes. She reviewed the things I did, and then exclaimed, "You know what? You're teacherly!"
