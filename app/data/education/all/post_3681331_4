That is what I told her but she just kept right on talking. She ask me how it was possible that I could have found it in it's place and then claim not to recall where that place was when it came time to put it up. I suggested that it could be like a specific mental disability, kind of the opposite of Obsessive Compulsive disorder, forgettin of course her freakish brother who counts that as one of his 9 mental conditions.  I could apologize but what is the point, the fact is I said it because it was funny to me and it did in fact make me laugh (inside my head). That was the last actually conversation we had and now I sit in an empty house wondering if maybe "because I thought it sounded funny" isn't a good enough reason to say something out loud.
