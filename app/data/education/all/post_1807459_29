So I had this great idea last night, that I'd just go home and go to sleep.  Well I did just that and I was out like a light at around 12.  This was all and good until I woke up at 3 and have been up ever since.  Today is going to be hell.  I feel fine now but I'll be dragging ass later.  I hear we are going to get treated to a lunch somewhere by our boss, I wonder where.  Happy T-day everyone.  I really hope we get some turkey.  I could go for some mashed potatoes too but hey we're in Korea.  I like being up early in the morning, but I guess not enough to wake up this early regularly.  I'm looking forward to the weekend.  Actually I'm really looking to work being over even that is only 12 hours away.  I just to lay down and get some good sound sleep.  I probably should have gone to the gym this morning but I kept trying to  go back to sleep.  I am surprised at how many people there are here at this time in the morning.  I guess most of these guys have been here from the night before and have been here awhile.  Hell I don't I know.  Time to play some games or something.
