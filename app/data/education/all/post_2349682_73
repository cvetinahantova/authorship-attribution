Being a Christian  When I say..... "I am a Christian"  I'm not shouting "I'm clean livin" I'm whispering "I was lost" Now I'm found and I'm forgiven.  When I say... "I am a Christian" I don't speak of this with pride. I'm confessing that I stumble and need CHRIST to be my guide.  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I'm not trying to be strong. I'm professing that I'm weak and need HIS strength to carry on.  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I'm not bragging of success. I'm admitting I have failed and need God to clean my mess.  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I'm not claiming to be perfect, My flaws are far too visible but, God believes I am worth it.  When I say... "I am a Christian" I still feel the sting of pain, I have my share of heartaches So I call upon His name.  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I'm not holier than thou, I'm just a simple sinner who received God's good grace, somehow.
