Apparently terminating Leo upset many people and there is now an  urlLink online petition going on , and I encourage you to sign it.  Maybe he will get his job back.  If he doesn't get it back right now, maybe he will when comcast and techtv merge.  Techtv will be merged with comcast's G4.  Hopefully this will be a positive change.  I am sorry, but Leo belongs at TechTv hosting Call for Help and The Screen Savers again, sorry Kevin and Cat.  But as I said maybe with the petition and a little luck and prayer from you all, Leo will once again be in our homes 2 times a night.  Good night America.
