April 14th Jeremy turned 18  April 24th Jeremy goes to High School Prom  May 4th  is Kristina's Birthday and she turns 12 this year  May 6th is Justin's Birthday and he turns 9   May 9th is Mothers Day   May 12th   is a wedding aniversary for James & Gizmo....  (14 GLORIOUS years...)   May 21st Gizmo gets one year OLDER....  May 27th Jeremy graduates from Terry High School        I am sure that the women in my life will correct me if I just screwed up on those dates.  The important thing is that these events are happening which is very cool.  :)  Gosh, I have an 18 year old graduating from high school.  Does that mean that he will be graduating college, getting married and presenting me with grand children before I know it?   Yipes.....  Thanks to Happy Days and Special Times I will be able to fly to Houston Texas so I can drive to Richmond Texas and see Jeremy graduating in person.  I am so excited about the possiblity coming to fruition.  Thank you Happy Days and the businessman who made the funds available so I can do this.  :)  I have been working 60 hours and 7 days per week for the last 2 to 3 weeks so I have been too busy to drivel in my favorite blog.  I need to find the time to do it though since I enjoy doing it so much....  Thanks to US Security scheduling too many people down at Charleston County Office building I wound up taking yesterday off and going bowling on the last night of the winter bowling league at Marrington Lanes.  This league is finally OVER!!  Yeah, I am SO happy about that for sure.  I think we wound up in 7th or 8th place.    Yes, on June 18th I will be joining the Travlers Bowling League which will be a summer league at the Royal Z Lanes in Goose Creek.  I shall NOT bowl at Marrington Lanes on a league ever again.  Why you ask?  Its simple.  They have synthetic lanes and for some reason I just can not bowl above a 130 average.  I seem to do much better on traditional bowling surfaces.  Last night I bowled a 122, 86 and 160.  What in the world happened on the middle game??  Whoooo boy.... That gave me a whopping 122 average for the night....  Oh well...  I surprised myself by prying myself away from the computer, put on my walking shoes and took a stroll in the neighborhood.  I walked 1.6 miles in 37 minutes which was a nice brisk pace for me. I even broke a sweat which is a good thing.  Myself and about 6 other men over at Battle Plan Ministries are holding one another accountable to eat LESS and excercise MORE.  That means that FAT BOY needs to eat LESS and exercise MORE starting today!!! That also means 3 meals per day and NO SNACKS when I get home at 11:30 pm.  It also means smaller portions.  I also need to get a new set of bathroom scales.  I found a nice bathroom scale that will handle up to 400 lbs and costs 40 bucks.  NO, I do not weigh 400 lbs. LOL.... I do weigh a tad over 300 though so that means I need scales that will tell me my true weight and not have to guess on our current scales that tend to spin like a propeller when I get on them....  LOL... Poor scales...  Speaking of propellers I am still trying to find a full time Information Technology job in the Charleston area.  I am currently working part time as a PC tech at a Goodwill Industries Outlet store in Charleston to make some extra mula and to keep my skills better than dull while the search continues.  This last week I saw 3 or 4 different positions in the Sunday paper.  Hopefully I can land one of them and trade my Security uniform (gorilla suit) for civilian clothes and some ethernet connectivity.  LOL...
