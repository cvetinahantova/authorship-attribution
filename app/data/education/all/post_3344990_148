urlLink jesus-connect.net :: Index   Have you ever heard of Jesus Connect Ministries?  If not, now you have.  :)  Jesus Connect Ministries is a para church ministry that has a clear set vision and ministry focus.  Our vision and ministry focus includes supporting the local church.  In other words, we know and encourage believers in Christ to faithfully worship and serve in their local church.    With that said, visit with us and read our vision and mission statement.  We have been online for 10 years now and in the last two years we have had to change servers and start from scratch.  That means we lost over 500 members.  Some of those members were active and some were not.  So, we have a nice clean start and we can start adding folks as of now.  If you register for an account I will validate you.   I am hoping to see some activity on this BBS soon.
