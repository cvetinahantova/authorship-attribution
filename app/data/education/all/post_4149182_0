As the title says...    Too many sappy love songs, to be honest. The adapted title of this blog comes from a song by Savage Garden, from way back in the day when I  used  to like pop music. But the feeling is the same. Actually, I remember dancing with Sam to that song way back in Grade 6... oh well.      Well, perhaps prayer will help. I  did  try, after all. And I should talk to Britney soon. From what Taylor says, she's actually a decent person... something rare to come by these days. And from what she's told  me  in the past, she and Courtney may be great friends on the surface... but there's an unpleasant side to the relationship.      Oh, and then there's the Chauncy problem. Don't get me started on  that  little asshole. He's probably one of the biggest causes of this whole mess, and if he stays at Regi, I'll make his worthless life as miserable as an English winter day. Mark my words. I can just imagine the shite he's been feeding her. He's so... Machiavellian. Bastard deserves punishment, and what he doesn't realise is that he's all alone. Nobody cares for him. Everyone hates him. I have the advantage.      This isn't going away, dammit. Looks like I'm in for the damned long haul. Just like the British in World War II... I got knocked on my ass, sure enough, and put on the defensive: but like Churchill said...      "We shall fight on the beaches; we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and the hills and the towns; we shall  never  surrender."      Amen, Winston. Amen to that.
