urlLink Management by Wandering Around: Reference Rovering and Quality Reference Service  Wandering around a library (or a classroom) can tell you a lot about how patrons are using library resources.  Is the library a big computer lab or is it primarily used to do research?  If you observe patrons when you do reference, teach, or are just walking about, you can learn a great deal which can make you a better instruction and reference librarian.  Abstract of blogged site: "Reference rovering is a method for eliminating the barrier of the reference desk which is between the librarian and the patron. This concept very closely parallels the business concept of Management By Wandering Around (MBWA). This paper looks at the literature examining the history and techniques of both MBWA and reference rovering. The techniques for how to conduct reference rovering are explored. Both the advantages and disadvantages of reference rovering are examined."  Full article at:  urlLink http://www.michaellorenzen.com/mbwa.html .
