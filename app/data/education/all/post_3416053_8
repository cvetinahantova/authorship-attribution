Assuming that users are trolling in blogspot.com; while using the whole internet results in a larger number of users it also results in a much worse probability.  The best odds result from focusing on people who are searching in the http://______________.blogspot.com/ format.  If we assume that most people will choose blog addresses that number from 5-15 characters then the odds that any one user will find this blog are:  (1/((26!/21!)+(26!/20!)+(26!/19!)+(26!/18!)+(26!/17!)+(26!/16!)+(26!/15!)+(26!/14!)+(26!/13!)+(26!/12!)+(26!/11!)))  Therefore the raw odds of anyone finding this blog are: (Number of users)*(Avg. number of blogs visited)*(1/((26!/21!)+(26!/20!)+(26!/19!)+(26!/18!)+(26!/17!)+(26!/16!)+(26!/15!)+(26!/14!)+(26!/13!)+(26!/12!)+(26!/11!)))  But, blogs will attract viewers in direct proportion to their current popularity.  I would estimate that any blog not already in the top 10% of popularity are have a finding probability that is best approximated by the square of the value that is listed above.  Therefore the final probablity is: ((Number of users)*(Avg. number of blogs visited)*(1/((26!/21!)+(26!/20!)+(26!/19!)+(26!/18!)+(26!/17!)+(26!/16!)+(26!/15!)+(26!/14!)+(26!/13!)+(26!/12!)+(26!/11!))))^2
