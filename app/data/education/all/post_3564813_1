Now, today was Deben House v Staff, and guess who won?! We did! Deben! I couldn't actually go though because I had to go home at lunch to eat. I also had media today after school, and started a small movie.  Ms Lonsdale was really nice to me in French today, she told me about Ms Tindles baby, and said she would tell her that we have made her a card (we have, but haven't got everybody to sign it). Honestly, forget what I said in Mondays post.  Can't think of much else to say, so I will probably either write tonight or tomorrow.
