curses!!!  i mean ok i didnt do as well with my freaking statcon subject. shame is on me for refusing to memorize the dead language--latin terms--costing me, i hope not, and god forbids, 20 darn points for this exam.  just some thoughts. why is it that erasures are forbidden and by golly the instructions the teacher gave was-- of all irony--ambiguous. the questionnaire said all answer must be in the booklet but later on he said that we should instead encircle our answers and write it on the questionnaire. well, teachers are human too, i should know, i used to be one. is this karma? hehehe. anyway, suffice to say i enjoyed again answering the essay questions. i am not sure though with the question concerning the franchise and the tax law. i put in my answer that the franchise is controlling. although what was said in the franshise law was 20% while the tax code asked for 20% gross sale, i think effort to harmonize the two would result to double taxation. oh i am torturing myself with this.   tomorrow is civil code day. i hope to do better in this subject. tonight i am going to stay late reading. at least i only have two more subjects to go, after that i could enjoy myself once more.  drew asked for a picture to be submitted tomorrow for sseayp tour guides. he just texted me yesterday. i am pressed for time and i need some break.i am thinking if i cant submit the picture to forego the opportunity to serve as tour guide for this year. i promised myself to attend the ship reception dinner though. i miss sashimi and miso soup. i miss the unlimited ice creams and sake. i miss saying ohayu. and maybe this time i would really go to grand bath naked and frolick with all those uncircumsized PYs.
