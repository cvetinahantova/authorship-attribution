urlLink Acquiring and Managing Electronic Journals. ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Curtis, Donnelyn and Yue, Paoshan.  It views the issues that libraries face when dealing with electronic journals.  From the ERIC Digest:  Electronic journals are both a blessing and a curse for libraries. To be meaningful in the current information environment - to meet users' ever-increasing demands - libraries must acquire as many appropriate full text resources as possible, as quickly as possible, and make them easy to use. This Digest provides tips for acquiring and providing access to electronic journals through a library's Web site and online catalog. We encourage readers to consult some of the Web sites and other resources we listed for detailed advice on licensing and technical matters, such as user authentication.   Staff enthusiasm is crucial for maintaining the momentum to solve workflow problems and overcome technical obstacles in managing e-journals.
