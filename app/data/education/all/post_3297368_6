The Road Less Travelled   I have found it more difficult to journalize entries this past week.  Writer's block perhaps, but closer to truth, there have not been any other significant developments between my colleague and I that are worth mentioning.  Also, I am working towards abating and understanding my deeply held attraction to her.  While picking up my belongings, I unearthed an old book aptly titled "Chinese Love Signs".  Despite the book's gimmicky context, it makes interesting conversation at parties, and doubly serves as an ice breaker.  After studying books about "I Ching" and "Taoism", I find the Chinese Zodiac fascinating not only by its predictions about human behaviour, but also its simple explanations about my sometimes seemingly complex personal relationships.  My girlfriend was constantly threatening break up towards the end of our relationship.  True to her astrological sign, the Goat, she was quick to change her mind each time I suggested we work it out.  Unbeknownst to her, salvaging the relationship was not what I truly wanted.  Out of a sense of responsibility, I was quick to resolve our differences, especially when it was driven over minutia.  When it finally came time for me to suggest dissolution of our relationship, she was devastated to the point of threatening suicide.  This, unfortunately, was not the first time she cried "wolf".  This was behaviour I observed a couple times over the months, usually with other family members.  That, coupled with her flip-flopping change of heart made the decision all the much easier.  In the end, she would not stand for a even a lukewarm friendship (although her tune seems to have changed again of lately).  Irony, as it would seem, placed my co-worker and potential love interest as an equally incompatible match.
