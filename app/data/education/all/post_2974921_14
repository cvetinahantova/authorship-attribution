i was so irritated with daryl yesterday. i was telling her something and she was in her "not in the mood" realm and was kinda attempting to pull me in. i hate it when she says she's okay when it's obvious she's not. she always says that she hates lying. well, she is! right in front of me! i don't feel like i can be open to her anymore.  hehe..i can be open to my parents, i guess. wow, i guess i do love them..
