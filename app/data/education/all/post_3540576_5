Firstly, it's been a while since I last posted, so I'll try to be more diligant in the future.  Being at Kyle's for the next week will give me plenty of free time to do this type of stuff.  Well, I didn't get my job at NOVA.  I'm not going to dwell on it very much here, as I've done quite enough of that on my own.  However, it has left me in a bit of a situation, as I sort of had all my eggs in that basket.  Julie has asked me to think about what I wanted to do with my life, and during my walk today I thought about it quite a lot.  The short answer is "I don't know."  This is not good enough however, and the problem is quite deep.  I'm 24 years old, I have two degrees, and my life is set for a career as a teacher.  However, I do not really want to teach, and have no real drive to do so.  This leaves me with few options however, as I'm not qualified to do very much.  I'm applying for a new job with a company called ECC, and I'm really hoping that it works out.  Julie and my ma say not to get my hopes up for this, but it's hard not too. For some reason, a reason that I cannot explain, going to Japan just feels like the thing I'm supposed to be doing.  I'm not a big fan of "destiny" and "fate" so I am not saying that it is my destiny to go to Japan, I just get a gut feeling that it is the right thing to do.  Well, until next time.
