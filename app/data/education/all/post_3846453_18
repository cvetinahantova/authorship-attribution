Isn't that such a good word. Yes, I do know that it was a song by Rachel Stevens, but it is such a great word. I can't think of any other great words, but I am completely sure I will come up with some in the near future!    Today......I went to Baker Street. I bought a great bag for school. It's blue and made by RipCurl. I did want the lighter blue one, but my dad said I would get it dirty, and that is the utter truth. I do end up kicking my bag home because I don't want to carry it home any more, seeing as I probably would be very tired and bored.   I did buy something else......but I have forgotten.   I was quite suprised with my father, as he was OFFERING to buy stuff, usually it's "Use your own money" or "Get your own money out", not "Do you want to go shopping and I'll buy you stuff?". Hmmmmmm......
