Went to Deny's place on sat to do a bit of our projects.. Feel so bad that Daryl's doing alot of work even though he's not the team leader.. Thanks Daryl..Oh btw, Deny's place is very lovely.. It's like a hotel..  You know.. Love is such a funny thing.. It literally changes somebody's character.. Take my younger sis for example.. She went into a relationship with this guy and my goodness, the way she talks to me is so different now.. It's like she's got a whole pot of honey shoved into her mouth.. Those who know her will know how rude and bold and brass she is.. But now.. Haha.. Just thinking about it sends shivers up my spine..That's so not her.. I'm not used to it.. Neither can my parents..Lol..  Yes, i'm a little envious.. It's like her boyfriend calls her everyday and talk mushy stuff, go out often.. What a far cry from mine.. Then again, the relationship just started out.. When you're in the dating stage, everyday is like heaven to you, sweet and mesmerising.. You miss the person and constantly want to hear his/her voice.. 1 year down the road, you'll think differently..   --*..Tip of the day: Sleep longer..*--
