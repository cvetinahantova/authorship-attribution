I was putting on the cream on my legs while I was watching  urlLink 'Extreme Makeover' . I had a fight with my dad again. Parents and children do share some common interests like fishing, travelling. I guess for my dad and I, the one must be arguing.   Back to the road, I am responsible for my dry skin as I don't live a normal life. I ruined the gift they had prepared for me when I was born. I waxed my legs until the skin is, as my father described, 'as dry as a dead old man'.   Then I re-realized the fact that people, I am not sure whether it's solely men, do set  urlLink criteria for women  to follow, even you two are very close......  This negative reinforcement put me in my shell tonight.
