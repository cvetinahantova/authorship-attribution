how do you start writing something like this?  I guess by just rambling on.  But does my story need any beginning or end?  Probably but it isn't going to get one for a while.  I am now about half way through a PGCE.  Its been a lot of hard work but also a lot of fun.  Teaching is great- although I seem to want them to like me just a little too much.  My second school placement is now three days old and is taking place in a school in Barnsley.  Its quite different from Matlock last term but looks set to be a lot of fun.  Trying to get my head round the fact that God is committed to me becoming a teacher and may want to teach me important stuff through the teaching experience and more shockingly use it for his kingdom.  Was dreaming a little bit the other day and got quite excited.  I mean what if the reason that there are loads of crispies going into teaching is not just because its one of the only occupations that has traditionally been accepted by the church but is rather a kingdom strategy.  Its fairly plain to all who care to look that education is facing a bit of a crisis at the moment, so what if those of us getting into it are actually part of something bigger than we suspect.  Its just a thought.  But its one of those things that gets my heart going.
