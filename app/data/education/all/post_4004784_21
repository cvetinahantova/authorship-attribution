yeah karen all dogs instinctively know how to swim but my dogs are too butt heavy and their muscles aren't strong enough to combat the big butts and they slowly and surely start to drown.  plus they can't get out of the pool so it's a big problem.   donna - i LOVE that song by beenie - but the line is tie me to the fan not time me to the fan.... other than that i now have that song in my head. but it's better than other songs you can get in your head i guess. like the other day i was thinking about hc and everything and had that "the female of the species" song in my head - now i can pass it on to all of you. hope everyone is having a good weekend... im off to find some excedrine. love k
