Day in, day out, I feel desperately regret not having treasure every second, minute or hour that has gone far away. I read a great deal while I am not sure if I've digested. Straggly mess in my heart and low self-esteem puncture my ego. I engage in every single confidence-losing activity, representative of wackey and nerdy cups of tea when alone. Enjoying "myself" is quotidian and thus am deluged with intoxication. It's clear I need sizable freedom and personal space. None the less, I am a typical maverick. Let it remain as it is. And I am still thundering across my path in my way.
