Most people know by now that Nate and I spent 10 days in the southwest corner of the USA before flying across the Pacific. Here are some highlights of each of the cities we contributed our hard-earned dollars toward:           Phoenix, Arizona:      ~ Stayed for free with my best high school buddy, Chil...also our best man in our wedding. Chil lives in a developing suburb called Chandler.      ~ Experienced first-hand what 118 degrees of dry heat feels like     ~ Wrote out Thank-You postcards      ~ Walked around ASU area in Tempe, Arizona     ~ Relaxed by swimming in Chil's nearby neighborhood pool     ~ Drove up to Sedona and got a psychic reading done!     ~ Hit some happy hours and local bars with many of Chil's friends     ~ Walked around Downtown Phoenix and went to a free outdoor art gallery     ~ Slept...recovered from a month of moving/painting/wedding planning/China planning           Los Angeles, California:      ~ Stayed in Hollywood at a decent, but not extravagant Hotel...had a nice view of the Hollywood sign.     ~ Rode LA's train system everywhere     ~ Had lunch in Chinatown     ~ Wandered around Koreatown     ~ Checked out Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, where cheap probably means $100 for a pair of sandals...if they even sell sandals there!     ~ Got a wheatgrass shot at the Jamba Juice off Rodeo Drive and realized that it's more expensive to get a wheatgrass shot in Minneapolis than in Beverly Hills! What's up with that?     ~ Took our shoes off at the Santa Monica Pier and let the tide roll in over our feet.     ~ Had dinner at "Real Food Daily" in Santa Monica and discovered my new favorite Vegan restaurant!     ~ Drove through some "tough" neighborhoods that were touched by the LA Riots, and are still touched by racism, poverty and hopelessness today.     ~ Went to the Chinese Mann Theater where the Walk of Fame is.          From Los Angeles, we boarded Korean Air and spent the next 12 hours of our life at 37,000 feet above the ocean so we could begin our journey in Asia. Nearly everyone on the airplane was a Korean-speaking person, so I confused the hell out of the flight attendants when I couldn't answer their questions in Korean. We had a 13 hour layover in Inchon's International Airport in Korea. Neither one of us slept much and sat awake between the hours of midnight and 5:00 AM in an eerily quiet airport...with the only sound being the custodial crew and the high-tech plasma televisions featuring Korean Olympians in various events. Finally, around 8:50 AM we boarded our airplane for another 3-4 hour flight to get to Hong Kong. Whew! What a journey! Hey, did I mention we haven't even seen most of our wedding pictures yet?
