easy to be cynical, there is a freedom that i can't miss talking about.  One that transcends and rocks our existence.  but we have to be carefull, this is not a whatever you want to fill in kind of thing. everything screams at us, of bondage.  the dog barks, and the man ruins.  ruins creation, ruins other people, and ruins himself.   its not the only thing he does, but it seems to be one he does rather 'well'.  He is totally free to ruin everything around him.. but this is the kind of freedom that is like the only thing tieing a man down is the gravity of his his depravity.  This is one falling down, and gaining greater and greater volicity just like anything that falls.  claw as one might, there is absolutely nothing the falling man can do, since he has not hit anything yet he might even conclude he isn't falling at all, besides, other people are level with him and it seems like they are just floating.  sometimes the airball of truth pops from under the water, no matter how hard we supress it.  so utterly unable to do anything about it, and ussually ignorant of the real state.  The effect of this speeding up life is a cause of a mor horrible then imaginable crash.  One infinitely greater than certian death that comes when someone falls from a great hieght in a physical realm.  It usually takes some time to understand bondage before you can begin to understand freedom.  So I will continue and bring some more analogies and exposition on spiritual bondage first if for only my own edification.
