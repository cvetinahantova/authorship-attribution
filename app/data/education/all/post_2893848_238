An Impeccable paraphrase of  urlLink Bush's newest ad :  Hey, we might be evil, but at least we aren't as crazy as those sick fucking Democrats.  Those cocksucking bastards need to stop the fucking negativity.  Maybe we make you angry with our policies.  Fine.  But do they have to be so  urlLink fucking  angry about it?  I'm sorry, but it just gets my fucking goat.  I am  glad this is the best he can do.
