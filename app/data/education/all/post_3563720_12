So, I've been up all night because my tempermental computer somehow corrupted my buddy's essay just before I could e-mail it to him - so I revised it twice (YUCK!). At least he'll get a higher grade on it than he would have otherwise received. Considering how bad I used to be about doing my own homework, it's ironic that the majority of my income is derived from doing the homework of others in one way or another.   I'm continually hearing some sort of vibrating noise tonight. I keep thinking that it's my cell phone, but it's not (I've checked it multiple times already). I think it's coming from above. My new landlord is in the process of moving into the other side of the duplex. I'm definitely not the biggest fan of hers right now. Not getting into it. I just hope that it's a cell phone and not her battery-operated significant other that I'm hearing. If I keep hearing it, I'll totally have to move. I can't picture that broad with a real boyfriend. She's in her late 20s, really unattractive, teaches pre-school, and lives with her three cats. Why did she have to buy the place and kick out my chill, attractive neighbors so that she could move in?   I don't think she could piss me off to the point where I'd rather live with my parents in Studio City, but one never knows.   Gooodnight.  P.S. Why, oh why, did the Nets blow the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Pistons? GO LAKERS! P.P.S. Dodgers finally won today. Kaz Ishii is 8-3 with a 3.36 ERA right now, yet he has looked so much worse than those numbers seem. I hope DePodesta trades him while he's still overvalued.
