I don't understand why it must be 30 below where I work!!!  What the hell, I mean what the artic! OH OH OH OH I forgot that I have a little space heater under my desk. YAY! Warmth.  Finally.  Ok feeling good. So I have big big news.  I will be traveling to Athens, GA on July 15-18, so if anyone would like to come with please do because I will be all alone.  Why am I going to Athens, GA you might ask?  Well I hope you are sitting down for this, I am going to.......drum roll........BALLOONAVERSITY!!!  How sweet is that.  Yeah ok so it's really kinda lame, but hey it's a free paid vacation in my book.  However it sucks that I have to go it alone.  I have some family in Georgia, but it's about 2 hours away from where I will be, and I won't have a car.......so I may not get to see them.   I have a family reunion next weekend too, and I'm not really lookin forward to it.  It's pretty much just a 2 day food fest.  Seriously we get together and eat and talk that is all.  This weekend is my lil' bros B-day!  He will be the big 21....woo woo.  It's gonna be a bowling party.  So I will get to show off my "skills"........lol.  If you've ever been bowling with me then you know I suck at it.  But it's fun.  Ok well back to work.  ttyl
