Dear Journal,             I always get this feeling like Mama’s mad at me; not just in a bad mood, but mad/ill at me specifically.  On those rare once-in-a-blue-moon nights when I go out with Kim, the days that follow are bad.  She says nothing, but when she looks my way, I feel like I’ve done something wrong.  Her look is icy.  Of course it’s just me!  But I really believe that, although I’m her daughter and she loves me and she’d do anything for me, I really believe that she doesn’t like me.  I always feel guilty about going out, or staying at someone’s house.  I feel guilty when I get home with or without a hangover, whether I had a great or lousy time.  But I always feel worse when I have fun.  Mama had the same look in her eyes when I asked to use the phone; she knew I was calling Jeremy.  She says she understands that I need to get out once in a while, but I’m pretty sure she’s meaning a job to go to.             Why do I allow myself to feel guilty?  For having a night of fun?  For allowing myself to slip out of my world for 1 night, just 1, into a whole new world...  A world of chaos and excitement, one where I get to be whoever I want, experience in one night all I missed in 5 or more years.  Why do I feel guilty?  I know I feel guilty because I let myself go, I let myself forget... Who I am, what I am and what’s waiting for me back in my world.  So, perhaps, it isn’t Mama at all; perhaps it’s just me!  It’s me!  I let myself forget, and wonder what-ifs... That’s why I feel guilty, why I am guilty!  It’s not Mama at all, it’s me!!
