urlLink Using Weird News to Teach About Verifying Information on the Web   Last month, I talked about the possibility of using the News of the Weird website  urlLink   to teach students about verifying information on the web.  And just like that a lesson appears based on my suggestion.  Miland Brown of Benton Harbor Community College submitted such a lesson plan to LibraryInstruction.Com and I have included the link at the beginning of this entry.  Go ahead and give the lesson a try this fall.  Please let me know if you use it and how it goes. Thanks Miland. I hope I can continue to get good reader feedback from this Blog.
