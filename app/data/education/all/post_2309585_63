Dark magician. You love the dark because of its beauty and just the life that no-one else sees. Mysterious, calm, quiet... But that doesn't mean you're not friendly!   urlLink   What kind of dark person are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Let me just say that I am so freaking pissed by the unnecessary slaughter of 26-year-old Nick Berg by Islamic extremists. I'm pissed that we had to go over there and act like jerks, treating their prisoners like animals. I'm pissed that they had to retaliate. And I'm pissed that people are going to treat this as another example of why we should be over there, when they don't want or need us in the first place.  By the way, many of you know that the full video of Berg's death is available on the internet. I don't suggest watching it. I did, because I can normally handle things like that, but it was really disturbing. Don't put yourself through that too.  I need to just defect to Canada. It's looking better every day.
