I'm blogging out of habit, really. I have nothing of any note to write about, but as I've been blogging about something most days recently, I sort of feel like doing it. I guess it's my one last attempt at not revising before my exam tomorrow afternoon. I'm starting to get a little tense now: little knots in my stomach and that nagging feeling that I haven't quite done enough work towards it. Oh well; too late to worry now, isn't it?  Blogger won't let me update my profile. I want to add new bands and new interests and stuff... Boo :o(  I feel less disgusting today, incidentally. I have new trousers and they cover my leg-related imperfections sufficiently. I also think my stomach has shrunk a little. I'm probably talking crap (as usual when I talk about my body), but still, I feel better for it.  Ceff x   Make a chick wanna hate, make a boy wanna stare...
