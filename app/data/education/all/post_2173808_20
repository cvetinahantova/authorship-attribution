Victor Davis Hanson has an excellent piece in the National Review online analyzing the rising tide of anti-semitism.  This development is one of the most depressing and worrisome things I've ever seen.  Mark Strauss had an excellent piece (Anti-Globalization's Jewish Problem") in the most recent Foreign Policy magazine.  In it, he analyzed the union of "brown, green, and red" with anti-semitism as the common thread.  Just more evidence that underlying all of this is fascism--the revolt against modernity, the infatuation with nihilism and death, the idealization of identity and volk, the rejection of reason, and, of course, hatred of Jews.  An how ironic that it's coming from the left rather than the right.  On the other hand, it was national "socialism" after all, wasn't it?
