Last night I felt the crushing blow of depression, the agonizing depth of sorrow that stems from the same longing for connection to spirit and knowing that I am of this world.  I tried not to wallow in it.  I tried not to let it take me into despair.  I chanted over and over, "divine mother, my divine mother".  I prayed for the touch of kindness and forgiveness that only divine spirit can give.  I know that today I can't stay in the darkness and I ask for the light to come, I know I can't dance with depression, so I ask for joy and release in the rain soaked day.    May it become ever more clear to me just how important it is to stand up to fear, anger, denial, depression, misery, torture and to boldly say, "NO MORE!" and to mean it with all my heart, to believe that by invoking this that I have renewed my efforts at living in the light, fully in the moment, prayer in motion, poetry in hope.
