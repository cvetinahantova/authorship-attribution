I have just returned from the Union Station, one of the best bars of Bemidji; it beats the other four by a long shot.  I'm fairly drunk right now, so I cannot remember clearly all that happened.  But that is alright, because nothing much happened.  Talked to Molly, Amy, Julie, Kvale (pronounced Qualie), Beth, and Chelsea some; perhaps others, too.  Some interesting talk.  Eric has an idea that Bemidji should construct a community center in Bemidji that would encourage a diverse selection of people to come to, to hang out and communicate.  While there woudn't be a drinking section, there would be sections for smoking.  There would also be no recorded or transmitted music; he wants to encourage music to be played by local musicians.  The idea was motivated by Bellah (spoken about in previous posts) and the purpose is for people from the community to share ideas with people they wouldn't share with normally.  I think it is a great idea, actually (I rarely agree with Kvale, because he is absurd).  The discussion we had tonight was fantastic for getting some different ideas out on the table concerning the perceived parking problem on our campus, which all of the groups seemed to concede was MERELY perceived, and that their wasn't a real problem.  OK, I'm going to bed, as I have a lot of work to do for the next week, and I need to start by Friday afternoon.  Goodnight.
