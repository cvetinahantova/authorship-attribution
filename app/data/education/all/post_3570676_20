Hello classmates! I'm here, I'm late, and for those of you that know me talk way to much.  Probably taking a class that I have to type my thoughts to you will definitely slow down my wandering thoughts.  Good to have you all aboard and hope that we can all learn something from each other.  Until next time  Bill Taylor
