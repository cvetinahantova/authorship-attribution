Well it is love at first sight.  A few days ago my friend's gave birth to four little tiny bunnies. Unfortunatly they lost two, leaving two very adorable little creatures.  In a couple of weeks, right around my birthday, I will be taking one of them home with me (my friend's 3 year old nice is getting the other one).  They are tiny and orange and mischevious, tell me this doesn't sound like Peregrin Took or Pippi Longstocking!! So whatever the sex, it will be a little Pippin! I shouldn't have any troble out of Miso (my turtle) he has the 3 goldfish to keep him company (Sushi, Sashimi and Tempura).  Brigid on the other hand... he has gotten quite used to being any only child! But I think he'll like the company. (He's my 4 year old Cockatiel and the love of his mommy's life!!)  After my grandmother refused to let me get a dog after my German Sheaperd died (Trinka passed on 2 years ago last April) I have been longing for something furry to cuddle with!! (I'm allergic to cats, which sucks cause I love them!!) I will try to get pictures of my darlings up on my website as soon as I can.  In the meantime I am taking a break from lesson plans untill I go back to school on Tuesday. (I start tues, my students start a week from Wed). And now I am off to Bedfordshire! ZZZZZZ
