Why does Ahslee Simpson have a show about her life? Who is ashlee simpson? Reality tv is the biggest hoax of all time, hands down. Seriously...a tv show about someone's real life events. What the fuck? Aren't we all living real life events as we speak? We go through these same things all day everyday. Why is it interesting to watch jessica and nick order chinese food and decide what movie to watch?     I think in a year from now we will have reality shows about people watching realty shows. Then VH1 can do a show where a they "re-cap" what happened during the show and all these stupid comedians can sit and do the commentary and make fun of the whole thing and talk about what a stupid show it was and how dumb the people were who were in it, and how what they did and how they dressed is so "5 minutes ago" now.      How can VH1 sit and make fun of all these shows and videos that they used to play and advertise not too long ago? Man... they seriously have the best formula: Make a product, convince everyone that it is cool, when the heat dies down make a show about how stupid and gay it was to begin with.  You see, there's no waste product. Mtv can make a show all about the behind-the-scenes drama of an awards show that they initially made to honor videos that they initially played.     For the love of God, please don't watch mtv or vh1 !!!!!
