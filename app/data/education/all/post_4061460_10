The kids had their lists of school supplies, and I had a lot of materials that I needed, so Cindy and I packed up the crew and headed to Staples. I know it is dorky, but I get a big charge out of new school supplies. I ended up creating six seperate "kits" of supplies for group work. I also ended up with a new stapler (works like a staple gun), tape dispenser, paper clip holders, folders, and stuff I may never need.  Jack went and got his hair cut. He got the "Caeser," and he looks very sharp. I kind of had to talk him into it, but he loves it now.  Next, we all went and got shoes. I got two pair of dress shoes - one brown, one black. They are quite comfortable and looks nice also - not too dressy, but not casual.  We couldn't decide whether we were going to have lunch next or just have ice cream. Of course we settled the matter by having both. We're Americans. Thats' what we do. Any guesses as to why I am forty pounds overweight?  Church today was nice, but tonight's Bible study was a bit boring. I hate when instructors just prattle on for endless minutes and then ask, "Well, what do you guys think?" By that point no one is in conversation mood, so we all just sit there and stare, which the instructor feels is his indicator to keep talking. Students, stop me when/if I do this!
