I've gone on a deviantART spree again, though this one was considerably shorter than the last ones. I'm going to slowly release my Fuerteventura pictures throughout the week, so be on the watch for those, because there's a few cool ones. Anyway, go  urlLink check it out .  Actually, I took one of the blurry pictures of Amber and played with it, and it turned out massively cool. It was actually a stem of a stem of an idea, so the original idea will have to be played with. The second stem made its way onto devart as well, but it's not nearly as cool.  Right, well. I'm off to bed. Oh, Juli's answering machine is awesome.  Current Music: Outsider - Your Love
