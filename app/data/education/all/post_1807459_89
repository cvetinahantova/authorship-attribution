Man I just need to take a break from life.  I haven't gotten a good sound night of sleep in longer then I can possibly remember.  It won't happen tonight either as it is good-bye night for Asma, Gabe, and Lois.  The party should start at Outback around 9:30.  I'll go as long as I can but no promises.  I wonder what the night will bring on there last night out.  I think I'll make a few predictions.  Someone will cry at some point.  Not a bad crying, but a sad type of good-bye cry.  I think we might end up at a singing room also.  In fact I feel pretty strong about this prediction.  I think there will also be cage dancing at GR.  I expect most everyone to be completely trashed, but that is a given.  I know we are eating Outback, but in the wee hours of the morn I think we might hit up New Blue one last time for some grub.  Of course TC and Bellagio will be visit at some point.  Good-byes have to be said to certain people who work at both places.  These are all pretty safe bets so I'll just stick with them.  Asma says she'll stay out all night, we'll see. Things  with Gyeh-son are going really well.  She is heading out of town this weekend so I'll be free to "giver" as much as possible.  Turns out she is in medical school and studying to be a surgeon.  Crazy.  How did she end up at the board game cafe.  I think we're dating now.  I think she is a genius or something.  She is also president of her class.  Bonkers man.  Anyway she seems really cool. Another day of LIKE.  My hatred for them has cooled off for the time being.  The are still fools intent of crippling their own company but I don't care.  Time has started to really pick up at move.  I don't know what the hell is happening.  I'll be 40 before I know it.
