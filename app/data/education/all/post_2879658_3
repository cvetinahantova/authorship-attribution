Konnichiwa!  I have been receiving a lot of emails recently in regards to my decision to leave Japan and where I am going to go from here.  Basically, I am not quite sure just yet.  I realized that another 18 months here in Japan would not allow me to experience the things I am looking for or hoping to accomplish at this stage of my life.  While the past six months have provided me with loads of first-time experiences and amazing discoveries about myself, the culture here in Japan, and those around me, I don`t believe that the situation I am in will enable me to be happy and satisfied for as long as agreeing to recontract would require.  I have now read loads of books ranging from Japanese fiction to theories of evolution, and even recently a book about becoming evil and what leads ordinary people to commit genocide.  I am continuing to study Japanese and my Tuesday night class has proven to be somewhat beneficial in that I am guaranteed a little structure.  Basically, I am reading and learning about anything I can get my hands on which is leading me to believe that at some point in the near future I will probably return to school for either a law degree or my masters.  Although this doesn't really provide you with a clear picture of where I will be or what I will be doing over the upcoming year, hopefully it will at least explain (although probably not very clearly) why I am leaving this experience in search of another new opportunity.   Another quick plea...if you have any contacts anywhere in the world that you think might provide me with an opportunity to experience something new and learn a lot in the process please feel free to let me know.
