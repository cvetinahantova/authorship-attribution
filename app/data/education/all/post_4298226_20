Walking past the streets my mind flashed back remembering the past the good and the bad  Suddenly,tears started rolling down my cheek without even realizing I found me crying so hard  I didn't know which past my mind went What I knew was it came into the past that I longing to forget for I can't never change my past Or My mind came into my past that was so good that I wish I can stay forever in that past
