urlLink adopt your own virtual pet!        Meet my new pet! Isn't she sweet?  Andy's band, Satchel Boogie, is playing a huge show tonight for some record execs. Actually the execs are there to see Haphazard, who is supposed to be the next big band to come out of Arkansas, but Satchel's opening for them. Keep your fingers crossed!  My new disturbing link is  urlLink Subserviant Chicken . Yes, it's a guy in a chicken outfit. He'll do whatever you tell him. Only in America, people.
