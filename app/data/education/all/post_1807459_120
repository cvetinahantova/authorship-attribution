Nothing like a day off.  I'm currently in the PC room Asma always used to go to and I can see why it is only 600won an hour.  The computers here are pretty crappy by Korean standards but what is annoying me the most is that the spacebar isn't working properly.  This is a real pain in the ass.  But I think I'll manage.   So it's great to have a day off and just be able to hang out and chill.  I hit the travel agent but he wasn't in again.  Damnit.  Oh well I'll got tomorrow.  I had a great workout at my new gym.  Then I walked over to the zoo, if you can really call it that.  More like a collection of a few animals.  They did have some tigers and elephants so I guess that makes it count.  It was a good walk so I've gotten more than my fair share of exercise today.  The hightlights of the zoo included someone wanting me to be in a picture with there baby.  This was a little strange but whatever.  They also had a three legged dog, poor guy.   I then chilled in SB and hung out.  I really love having my afternoons free.  I didn't make it to homeplus but I might do that yet depending on when it closes.   Last night was a lot of fun.  But we didn't eat any sam gyup sal.  I guess it will make it all the better on Saturday night.  I can't decided what to do with my hair.  I'm getting pretty shaggy but I don't know if I should embrace it or I should kill it and get it cut.  I kind of like it but it's a little difficult to style in the event I want to make myself all pretty for a night on the town.  I've found a killer place to eat chicken late at night.  So next time we're all going nuts downtown and need some food we'll hit this place.   Tim even though you don't read this page thanks of the circus peanuts, they're really good.   I think I've giving up on spell check.
