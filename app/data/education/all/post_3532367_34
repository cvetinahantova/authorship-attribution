Last night was like a rollercoaster ride. Got home annoyed at having effectively missed the first half of the football, due to helpful colleagues making me work the late shift. We won, but not having played the best. Sandra was in a good mood, we cuddled up and had a hug and the kids went to bed early, things felt good.   Then it all went wrong - a door slammed in the wind, knocking a cross-stich picture off the bookcase, the glass broke. The kids got it in the neck for messing around (they weren't) and having a messy room (it was) and I got it in the neck for not having hung the picture properly. The kids were made to get out of bed and tidy, which they did for an hour, going to sleep themselves at exactly 21:00 (the time I had told them to stop) - they were golden.  Sandra didn't speak for the rest of the night and went to bed early, still in a mood, having said she lives in a hell hole, where no-one cares. She still won't go to a doctor.  My reaction? I stole the details off a credit card that was lying around and registered on a dating website! A 'double whammy' straight for the 2 things that I use to make me happy - spending and sex! What made it worse, was that this time I knew I was doing it - and why, but it didn't stop me.
