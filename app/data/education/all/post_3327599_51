OMG how do you ppl handle getting up early all the time? i got up at like 7:45ish... lol and i'm exhausted. i didn't even do anything today. at 11 the girls and i came over here to mess with the animals and we managed to lose a toad in the house for 45 mins.. haha.. and then we went to mcdonalds where some lady babbled spanish to me until she saw i looked confused and in better english then me said "oh.. do you speak english? i'm sorry do you need this?" and held up an application. she thought i was there to apply for a job.. as i sat there drinking my pop.. and trying to get the girls to eat.. do i look hispanic? anyway.. after that we went to the park for like 3 hours.. but that's ok because they had fun and i got to talk to this cute guy who was there with his cousin. we started talking about work and stuff and that's when that line came up "i mow lawns" it just sounded funny.. he was nice and he hung out with me for like 30 mins and then i went home.. and locked my keys in the car.. but i had to go to the bank so now that has to wait till tomorrow..  funny story about the bank! i haven't balanced my check book since.. march.. and i haven't deposited any money since my last pay check 3 weeks ago.. so yesterday i used my check card every where i went like the dumbass that i am! so i got online and checked it and had to add in some stuff that didn't clear yet and i found out i have like a dollar and some change HAHA how good am i?? hopefully i didn't forget anything..   i feel like having a 3rd section but i have nothing else to talk about.. not that anybody is reading this anyway.. you can wake up now i'm done.. btw you have something right there.. ya missed.. there ya go
