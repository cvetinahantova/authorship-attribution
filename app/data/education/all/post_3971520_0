Ok, read my comments section if you don't know what getting 'krunk' means. Thanks for making me feel a little less stupid, by the way. Today was hard. We were all a little cranky and it was hard to stay positive with a group of girls who are a little less than Olympic talent. We forget that they have one-track minds and that they are all about boys. That is all that is on their minds. I got to go "Coach Langford" on them today, though. I was boiling and then a girl threw a ball to get it to the ball bin and hit me with it, instead. They all know that they are to walk the balls to the ball bin to avoid such an event. I slammed a ball down on the floor and screamed and made them do push-ups. They didn't try to throw the balls in the bin anymore after that. I forgot that I had such a temper. Nah, just kidding. I knew. You can all imagine the whole scene. LoLo with a red face and hollaring, trying not to let the voice get too shaky. Yeah. That's how it went. Anyway, I wasn't so 'krunk' today, but they still love me. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if I hadn't gotten clocked by the best hitter in the seventh grade that very morning. I mean, she hit that ball so hard that when it hit me in the jaw, it jerked my head over like in the movies when someone gets hit. I turned around to regain my focus and all of the coaches said that I had that glazed look. You know. The sleep-walking one. I couldn't hardly see or stand up, either. The girl felt really bad, but I wasn't mad. I couldn't even talk right. What was I going to say to her? If I said anything, it would have been that drunk, slurred voice that I get when I am not all there, anyway. It took about 10 minute to regain my senses, but I did it. What a day it has been for the coach today.
