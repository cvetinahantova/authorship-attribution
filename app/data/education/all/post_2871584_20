We had a hypnotist come to campus tonight.  He was really funny.  As usual, some students got hypnotized, and some students got up there and performed, pretending that they were hypnotized.  I wonder if they realize just how easy it is to tell the difference from the audience perspective.  Of course, I'm one to talk, having had some rather interesting hypnotism experiences myself.  Anyway, it ended up being a looong night.    It wasn't a long night because the performer went on so long, although he did.  But he did at our request.  During the show, a bunch of police drove by the building with lights and sirens.  No one paid any attention to it.  It's fairly normal in our area of Utica.  A little while later, Security came in and pulled the staff aside.  We were ordered to keep the students there for at least another half hour while police were securing the area.  Why?  Eh.  Someone got shot in the head a block and a half from campus.  No big deal.    It's so nice to be back...
