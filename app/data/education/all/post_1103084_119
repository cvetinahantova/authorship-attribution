...................................................................................  sparkling clean septic systems and airline culture  ...................................................................................  6:37 a.m. -- i hear addison coughing upstairs, its a bit of a gagging cough and i'm a pretty over-protective parent when it comes to sickness...  i arrive to find him throwing up on every piece of bed linen, pjs, pacifier, you name it.   i rush him to the toilet so he can hold his head in it (which he clearly enjoys) and not throw up anymore.   i briefly remember the scene from trainspotting.  i think about how much more alluring, clean and sparkly our bathroom, toilet, and possibly even septic system is than that one was.    I wipe him clean, make him a sicky bed on the couch downstairs.  (one of my favorite memories from being childhood was sickbeds on the sofas.)  (parenthetically to that parenthetically, one of my favorite traits about my grandma linda was that she always refered to couches as "sofas" or "davenports" -- never couches.  i subsequently always presumed that the word: couch was a bit lowbrow.  my grandma linda was a pretty class act.  more on that later.)  9:00 a.m. -- the babysitting coop is scheduled to arrive -- no word yet on whether sickness will postpone their arrival.   11:30 a.m. -- jaelyn's preschool is having a thanksgiving feast for which she volunteered us to bring hotdogs.  every four year old got to volunteer their specialty food.  so the menu includes popcorn, hotdogs, white cake & (i pity the four year old's parents who volunteered on this one --) turkey.  3 p.m. -- i leave for 5 days in miami.   that's right i'm leaving my wife with a sick two year old and a precocious 4 year old for five days.   i don't feel good about that.  but i do relish the chance to be in liminal spaces all days -- airports / airplanes -- alone.    finding space to be alone is so difficult during this season of life...there's something so freeing in the massness, the globalizingness, the strangerhood of airline travel...its a world (at least here in the "developed" world) that is so antiseptic...  i don't embrace those values, but i have to admit that they provide me a place for solace.   peace~
