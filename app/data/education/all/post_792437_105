Hard to work!    Â  I guess it's hard to work when you are soo stressed out and have so much on my mind. I told myself I'd get a lot done when I got home, but it seems that I didn't do much but end up sleeping. Acck, the clock is ticking and time is running out, yet I can't find the energy to get things done :( Guess I realized one thing today....I listen to a lot of music when I have too much on my mind...
