I am amazed that I go to church and sometimes don't get to see the people who are in our college group, I mean they go to the same church and everything but it seems like it is a hit or miss sometimes. I got to hang out with most of the college and career today I realized how much I miss getting together to fellowship. I am really excited about college group starting up again. I am also excited about our girl's group, I am also scared because am I worthy enough to be teaching a whole group of women? I know Hannah will have my back but it's like who am I? Just Cela! I pray that it won't be about my teaching or guidance but about what God wants to do, building prayer warriors in the woman. I also pray that relationships will be built and that we can support and encourage each other throughout the week.
