before i get back to texas by scott  before i get back to texas i should thank pete for the great article on eggers, dfw, irony, and pabst. as i read this, i worried that the symptoms described of a "mcsweenyite" have me in their embrace. i say worried because of the fear that pops; namely not appearing individualistic. but then i took some deep breaths and realized that dave eggers, a man like myself furnished and homogenized in the affluent north chicago suburbs, is a great writer. the fact that he shouldn't be a great writer due to his "adolescent revving" and other obvious demonstrations of what has come to typify irony is all part of the seachange.   the problem of being hip is always staying ahead of the game. the kids drinking pabst can create an anti-marketing idea, but the truth concerning pabst is that it's only chosen to be drunk as the demographic beer of choice because the stuff is cheap. even that is wicked ironic, look at the numbers.   what's funny about our literary world today, with eggers at the captain's wheel, is that it is a perfect fit. that irony should even come up in discussion is redundant. do you watch jay leno? jay leno does the traditional monologue of jokes to start his show. he says the name "jennifer lopez." the joke, everyone knows, will be about J Lo's big ass. why do we all know that? that we all do is something of great awe.   a friend of mine once said, "anyone with a brain has to hate society." our first reaction to anything has become scorn. so it follows that i hate to be ironic; i would like to scorn the hipness of this literature that uses every trick imaginable to always stay ahead of the game. but some of today's best writers are in eggers' bag. this is not a rebellion, it's a result. and irony has ceased to be irony. irony is now awe: the inevitable response of a sensitive mind to the world.
