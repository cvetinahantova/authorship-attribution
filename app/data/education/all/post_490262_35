The first year I taught was really hard.  And I was lucky--I got hired at the school I student taught at so I knew the staff but it was still hard.    My friend Amy was on my "team" of first grade teachers and we helped each other whenever we could but it was only Amy's second year so she was still kind of clueless.  Diane was also on our team.  She was a veteran teacher of 20 + years.  She was a big help but she had so many ideas and stuff it was kind of overwhelming.  Julie was the final member of our team.  She had been teaching for 4 or 5 years so she still remembered how hard that first year was and she was so calm and reassuring.  I went to her a lot.  Julie was one of those people who was just born to be a teacher.  She had her first graders wrapped around her little finger.  She never had to raise her voice.  They adored her so of course they would do whatever she asked.  She was also one of those really creative people.  The McGyver of decorating.  Just give her a paper bag, some raffia and a branch of dead leaves and she'd have a stunning centerpiece whipped up in no time.  Every wall of her house was painted a different color and it looked good.  And she was gracious.  The kind of person who brought a little gift whenever she visited your house--not because she felt like she had to but because she wanted to.  A little over two years ago she was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor.  She immediately had an operation and followed up with radiation and then chemo.  She went on to have several more operations but the tumor always came back.    Julie died yesterday morning at home surrounded by her family.  In a way I'm glad she didn't linger too long but I'm also going to miss her.
