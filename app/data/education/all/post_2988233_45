I just checked my referrers list on my counter page, and I am getting hits from people who are googleing "who got kicked off American Idol"  How funny is that.    I find it weird when I google something and get my own blog.  Then, I get a bit nervous, I mean, what if someone who knows me finds my blog and reads it.  I have several family members and in-laws that are on the internet, what if they stumble on my blog.    PANICCCCCCCCC...  so for allyou people wanting to know, John Stevens lost tonight on AI.
