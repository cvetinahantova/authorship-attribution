One done and onto the next one..    Â  Talking to my parents I told them that now that I have bought my car, my next investment will most likely be a house. Heh, they both told me to hold off. Haha,as if I'm going to conquer the world! Mmm, though buying a house sounds cool. Just gotta keep setting your goals a bit higher. Though I wonder if this one is too high? I mean, yah the car, but that's a huge leap to a house! mmmmmmmm but what else could it be though??
