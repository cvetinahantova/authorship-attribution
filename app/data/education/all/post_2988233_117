recuperating, catching up on sleep, pondering what to do, and just generally my brain is tired!  Casey had an appointment with the sports medicine doc today.  He can only guess he has tendonitis from over use.  Advised Casey to only pitch at 70% to see if it helps.  Thanks.    I kept Savannah this morning, she always brightens my day.  She is such a bundle of joy to be around.  Her and Noah played the "my Gee" game in the doc's office, so more times than not, I had both of them hanging around my neck screaming "my gee, my gee" People were cracking up.  The nurse thought she was mine.  Said her and Casey looked just alike.  HA! They aren't even blood related!    Casey also resembles my younger brother Michael. A lot, he reminds me so much of Michael at his age.  It is spooky. You have to remember I am adopted and am absolutly no relation to my parents none, nada, zip, zero, so when we are told my kids resemble this family member, or that family memeber.  We laugh. We laugh hard, all my life I have been told God must have given me a blood transfusion when my parents adopted me.  Soemtimes I think it is true.
