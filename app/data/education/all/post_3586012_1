Haiz... Sch reopening tml le lor... Time really flies sia... 1 month juz passed like that... Im still in that holiday mood... Very reluctant to go back to sch wor... Wat's so good abt schooling anyway? U gotta face those evil teachers who always give u mountains of homework daily... Going to sch is so meaningless! Hope I can grow up soon... Then dun need to go through these tortures... Haiz... Then hor... Dun even know whether I still can go my  lao gong  house that often or not... Haiz... Luv ya  lao gong ... I really do...
