Well, now that school is over and summer break is here, I'm spending a lot of time at home with my daughter. She's 2 months shy of her 2nd birthday now, and she's showing it more and more every day. For example, as I sit here at type these words, my daughter is carrying on an unintelligible conversation with herself, and smacking a book because the batteries are dead and it isn't making the noises it should. And right after I typed the previous sentence, I was prompted to read the Noah's Ark book to her 3 times in a row.  So after the third time, she trots back to her play area and picks up right where she left off.  With all of the time that I'm spending here at home, I start asking myself how the stay-at-home parents do it. I know at least one stay-at-home dad, but most SAH parents are moms. Between my wife and myself, I see me being the one most likely to become a SAHD. I have to admit though, it's a scary thought. I don't feel like I get anything done around here. I am feeling pretty good right now because I'm actually getting to watch the Braves play the Phillies after having to watch Dora the Explorer all day. But my laundry is way behind, and I haven't cleaned up our dinner dishes. And if I was to become a SAHD, how would that interfere with my life as a youth minister?  So many questions, so little answers. Besides, I'm still working on prying the perpetual pacifier from my daughter's mouth while attempting to potty train her, and getting some towels washed. All of that, and I'm blogging?!  Peace, Mr. Mom
