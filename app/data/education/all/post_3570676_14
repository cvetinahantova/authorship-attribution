Hi guys~ Hope all is well with each of you! Here's my list of resources for a study on the Holocaust using Elie Wiesel's "Night" as the reading.  http://www.nizkor.org/ This is a great site with info about every aspect of the Holocaust, it even battles the debate that some believe that it didn't happen. The two main areas that I will be using from this site are the "66 Questions & Answers about the Holocaust" and the area about "The Camps." I am however going to allow the students to roam around this site and look at anything they please but will ask them to concentrate on those 2. This site will be used as a reference to mainly camp information as well as a resource for the students on a final project that they may do. I'll refer to it as " urlLink Everything Holocaust ."   http://www.ushmm.org/outreach/nrule.htm This site deals mainly around the Nazi rulers and the part that they played in the Holocaust. There is a timeline as well as keydates area that I think will be very useful for most students. I also like the fact that there is a glossary on the page. This site throws in every event that was happening during the Holocaust and the affect that it had on it. I like that the articles on the site are "short, sweet, and to the point." I feel that that more students may actually read what they are supposed to and still get the info that I want them to from the little article. I would use this site when teaching about the part that Hitler played as well as to give them a place to go to for dates and terms. I will refer to this site as " urlLink The Nazi ."  http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CAP/HOLO/ELIEBIO.HTM  This last site is a biography on Elie Wiesel. Students would read this site in order to get a sense of the type of person that Elie is instead of just someone who survived the Holocaust and wrote about it. I think the site could give a deeper insight when they read "Night." I'll refer to this site as " urlLink Elie ."
