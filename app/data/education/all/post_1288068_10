Hooray! The boy is home from Cannes with a vague tan and tales of corporate cash-spunking that would make you cry if it weren't so damned funny. I'm sure he will post pictures over on  urlLink his blog  sometime soon. Perhaps when I stop hogging the internet connection.  This afternoon we have been doing some pyjama-dancing to the frankly unnerving  urlLink Rodeohead  and buying tracks for 79p on the amazing new iTunes Music Store. You should get iTunes! It rocks hard.  We are having Sainsbury's moussaka for tea.  That is all.
