This weekend I attended Fresno Bible Church's Father-Son Banquet with my father in law.  Thursday night my mother in law called to let us know that the theme would be "Wear A Professional Sports Jersey to Prove What a Sports Fan You Are."  I don't think that the rest of the story even needs to be told -- does it?  Since I'm the author / teller of the story...I don't think it gets any better than that...
