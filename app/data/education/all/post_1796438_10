Its 3:22 am. And I'm cold. And I'm tired.  I've completed 1,469 words of my English Lit essay that is due in about 5 hours from now.  I've completed 0 words of my Physics report that was due in 67 hours ago.  I hate my life right now. Why do things always get left to the last minute? Everyone else in my classes seems to be able to get things done on time.  To ake things even better (Ha!) exams start Wednesday, now less than 48 hours away.  I'll come back when I'm less tired & grumpy.  Why am I even on here? I should be working.
