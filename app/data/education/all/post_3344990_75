Ten days and counting.  That is how long it will be before we are moved out of Simpsonville SC to Travelers Rest SC.  We found a single wide trailer with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths to move into.  The landlord there was willing to work with us with regards to paying rent by the week and the deposit was low enough so that we could afford it.  We were starting to think that we would have to stay in a motel for 4 to 8 weeks while we found something that was affordable.  Now we dont have to worry about getting a storage place for our stuff.  Wahooooo!   We will be taking Justin and Kristina to Camp Happy Days on Sunday and then picking them back up the following Saturday.  We will be moved into our new location by the time we pick them up.  The kids decided that they liked the new digs which is cool.
