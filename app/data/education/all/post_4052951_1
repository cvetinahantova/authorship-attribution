BOURNE TO ROCK   A review of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY   By Andy Black   This wasn’t my first choice for the title for my movie review for the movie THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. Rather, my first choice was BOURNE IN THE USSR – as most of the movie takes place in Russia. But unfortunately, in 2002 I wrote a review of the first movie THE BOURNE IDENTITY called – you guessed it – BOURNE IN THE USSR. My friends all said that I was crazy at the time. After all, the first Matt Damon thriller wasn’t even set in Russia. They suggested I call it BOURNE IN THE USA. However, in THE BOURNE IDENTITY, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) never even steps foot in the USA or even one of our non-continental properties (Puerto Rico, Australia).   So I decided to title my review BOURNE IN THE USSR – partly for irony and partly to pay homage to that great Beatles song, which I late found out was called BACK in the USSR. However, I felt that my readers* would be astute and pop-culture savvy enough to recognize this obscure reference. One friend, who since has stopped give me suggestions, came up with the title BOURNE TO RUN. I spent much time in contemplation over this and ultimately decided that BOURNE TO RUN would be a better title for the review of a yet unproduced sequel. The first Matt Damon movie, an epic confrontation between the CIA and a man with no memory, was not so much about running as it was about a man finding his true identity and learning to love again.   However, I feel that the sequel, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, an epic confrontation between the CIA and a man with no memory of anything that happened before the BOURNE IDENTITY, is also not so much about running as a man trying to secrete his identity. And what’s next after you pigeonhole yourself into a special personal place among the billions of people who are each as different as every falling snowflake? You rock. This gave me a perfect title. Until I started thinking that the irony factor would have probably befitted this review a lot better (wasn’t the USSR always trying to gain supremacy?), and also, as I've said, a large portion of the movie is set in Moscow.   But this just goes to prove my point: when you write movie reviews, you have to be vigilant. I have already started to think of a title for the third movie in the trilogy, BOURNE FEVER. If he gets his ever-elusive freedom, I think I’ll call it BOURNE FREE.   * - As of yet, I don't have any "readers."
