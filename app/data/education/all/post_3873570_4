Today was a fine day!  I saw my best friend.  At the beginning we juast stared at each other without much to say.  It was very comforting to see each other, but we were getting acquainted with our new looks.  Hers is more drastic than mine! She is beautiful no matter what.  After wtaching TV, I let her read the poem.  I've never written a poem to a friend before, she is truly special.  I also showed here the pics and gave small green gifts.  It could not be another color, right?  We went to lunch, and I let her drive through Alameda.  She's actually pretty good!  When we arrived home time was running short, so we did our favorite thing to do: lay in the couch next to each other.  I enjoy that because we are close in body and spirit.  It was almost like a mother daughter situation, Teesa fell asleep on my shoulders!  What's amazing is that I know how hard it is for her to sleep, and being with me relaxed her to the point she could do that.  It made me very happy!  I wish we could have some more of those moments before school starts...  Maybe next Monday?  I don't know.  Besides that nice moment something really important happened: we made a pact.  I will not smoke not even 1 drag, and she will not cut herself even one small cut.  Smoking and cutting are two self-destructive habits we have that need to die forever.  It will work!  I hope from the bottom of my heart that she does NOT let me down, because it could be extremely painful to overcome.  She has my trust and I have hers; we are very vulnerable, but at the same time we are two tough women.  I believe in us!  I love us!
