A-Rod's Guru    "Superstars don't think like everyone else,"  urlLink Fannin  said. "The average person has 2,000 to 3,000 thoughts a day, and 60 percent of the average person's thoughts are in chaos. The superstar has 1,100 to 1,300 thoughts a day. They eliminate worry, envy, jealousy, embarrassment and anger. The superstar thinks a lot less and holds a thought longer."   Is it me, or did he just call A-rod a simpleton?  Worry, envy, jealousy, embarrassment, anger:  they make us who we are.  Substitute "the President" for "superstar," and it's somehow both scarier and more accurate.
