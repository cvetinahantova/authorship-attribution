I was so busy yesterday (July 28) because we were celebrating the Feast of St. Ignatius and we had the FINAL REPORT of the student council and Induction of New Officers. It was a fruitful  year for all of us here in LST. I remembered then that I forgot to write an entry in my blog. Anyway, we brought tina outside to get a taxi and rode immediately to the Airport, a flight to Zamboanga at around 3:00 Am. After few minutes she was crying over the phone while talking to Kuya Joseph because out of her excitement she lost the bulk of materials for her thesis she was bringing in the taxi...hmm I wonder how she looks in the airport while crying and feeling helpless..hay naku tina talaga...   Today, we are making letter to the LTO to help us claim those papers (hay..crossing our fingers!) sana di tinapon ng mamang driver. I woke up this morning at around 2 AM feeling not so alright, so restless....I tried to go back to sleep but I can't. Tinanong ako ni Kuya Vhan kaninang umaga kung umiyak ba daw ako, sabi ko Hinde inuubo lang ako. I lost weight and my exams sucks! I hated myself! I am counting the days remembering Jorge always. Bakit kasing nagkataon umalis sya nag- exam rin kami, nakakainis!  Siguro talagang di pa ako sanay na wala siya, masasanay rin ako. Minsan nakita ko si Dedeng sabi ko sa kanya nalulungkot ako, sabi nya sakin masasanay din daw naman ako ng wala si Jorge ganun din ang sabi sakin ni Ate Pangga. Perhaps... ganoon talaga kailangan matatag ako.  Nag-rereview na ako for my comprehensive exam...at gusto ko na ring umuwi sa amin. Dito ksi kahit san ako pumupunta parang andun ang anino ni Jorge...kaya mis na mis ko siya.  Hintayin ko na lang siya...
