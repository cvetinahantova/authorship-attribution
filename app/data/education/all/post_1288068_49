Oh dear. As predicted, going from an eighteen hour working day to eight weeks of unfettered freedom has driven me slightly crazy.  Last night did not sleep one wink due to being merely a bit sleepy rather than exhausted to the point of collapse. This was compounded by the boy being mysteriously tired and going immediately to sleep in a very angular and pointy-elbowed way. Was forced to shake him awake several times and demand to discuss the day's hot news topics and/or where would be the best place to live in South London.  Am thinking maybe I should get an Insomniac Messenger Buddy; someone to be on call 24/7 for my conversational amusement just in case I can't sleep.   Yesterday was rubbish. I am sick of this flat with its poky corners and mouldy ceilings. And dust. I had promised myself I wouldn't go out for the day until I had transformed it into a veritable Cif palace, but frankly I couldn't give an arse anymore. I am going out. Behold! My Tate Modern membership card! Wonder! At Â£2.50 for UNLIMITED BUS TRAVEL! I feel I'm rather too excited.
