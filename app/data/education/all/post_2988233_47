I have to say I agree with Simon on AI.    Which I do most fo the time anyhow, but he was dead on about John last night.  He has taken each and every hit like a man.  That is part of why I liked him.  That and his unusual style.  But as much as I liked him, he wasn't an American Idol.  I'm glad they finally ended the torture for him.  Each night during results, he looked so pained, and poor kid, couldn't dance his way out of a paper bag.  I do look forward to some record company signing him to a contract to sing maybe standars, or Harry Connick Jr type stuff, he would do good at that.    SO who's next, George huff, please, hopefully, no offense to all those Huff fans, I just can't stand to watch him, he has this goofy look on his face all the time.
