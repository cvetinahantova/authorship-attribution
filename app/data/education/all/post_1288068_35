We are not going on holiday this year. It's okay, I've come to terms with it. Long time readers will recall that the boy and I have  never  been on holiday, unless you count that time we went camping in Cornwall. And we don't.  The reason we are not going on holiday is that we can't afford it. Yesterday, for the record-breaking 6th summer in a row, I was greeted by the immortal words  AVAILABLE BALANCE: £0.00 YOU MAY WITHDRAW: £0.00 UNDERSTAND? NOW PISS OFF, LOSER.*  at the cashpoint in Westminster Station. Bugger.  The bank have taken away my overdraft  -  the injustice! I may write an angrily worded letter. Or perhaps just phone them and beg.  Yes, I am feeling sorry for myself. Revolting, isn't it?  But! There are worse places to be stuck. London, for chrissakes! This weekend we have been throwing ourselves wholeheartedly onto the throbbing groin of our great nation. Yesterday we took a boat all the way up the Thames to Kew. Our cheeky Cock-er-nee captain showed us the street where Oscar Wilde lived, Michael Caine's fancy flat, beautiful Battersea Power Station, and the place where all of our rubbish is compacted and put onto barges. That bit made me feel strangely proud  -  that's our rubbish!  We spent the afternoon lying in Kew Gardens, marvelling at sunflowers and bamboo and reading all the dedicated benches.  Today we went to Greenwich, Where Time Begins. It rained on our picnic, but we stayed out like hardened Scotsfolk while all the namby Southerners ran for cover. Grr! After only-slightly-soggy sandwiches we went to the National Maritime Museum and saw menus, tickets and amazing silk slippers from the Titanic.  We are at home now, watching Bill Bryson being diplomatic about Scotland.  Tomorrow I have shitloads of schoolwork to do. Have given up utterly on finding somewhere new to live. All you summer visitors will just have to cope with the mouldy bathroom. At least the slugs have gone.  *In retrospect, I may have imagined that last bit.
