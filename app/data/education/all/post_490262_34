I commute about 30 miles (each way) to work every day with my two sons, Nolan, a 2 1/2 year old and Mason who is 6 months. Most of the time, especially in the morning, it's very quiet. We listen to the radio or sing songs. This morning, however, there was a bit of drama that went something like this...   Nolan: Mama, Mama, Baby Brudder has sea otter book.   Me: (listening to NPR with one ear) What? Mason has your book? OK.   Nolan: Mama, Mama, Mason has my book! (much louder voice)   Me: Honey, I'm sorry. I can't get it for you right now. I'll get it for you as soon as...   Nolan: (yelling loudly) No! Baby Brudder, no put book in mouth! Mama! Sea otter book! Give me my sea otter book!   Me: Nolie, Mason is just a baby he doesn't understa...   Nolan: (in sweet two year old voice) Thank you, Baby Brudder. Thank you for give sea otter book.   So maybe Mason does understand...
