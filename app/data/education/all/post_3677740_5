have you ever felt an extreme negative feeling about yourself that there are tasks that needs to be done but you feel that you are not good enough or that you are not equipped?   this is exactly what i felt when i was given a chance to disciple some of my students. initially i have no intentions of discipling students because in would create a situatinal paralysis because i am their teacher. i cannot perform simultaneous tasks of being their teacher and at the same time being somebody who would guide them spiritually, i feel that i am just a 'baby christian' (if there is such term).   i was busy reconciling the fears in my heart that i forgot what was discipling all about. discipling is not about YOU, in this case not about ME, not even close. discipling is a work cut for God. You can be a medium but you can never be the subject.   i almost kicked my self (if that would be possible) because i was so scared about the fact that i did not bother to stop and think (considering that i have a skull but then what's the skull for if my brain is not functioning that well) that it is never about us, it is all about God, that He had done so much for us.   truthfully, i know for a fact that some of my students sees me as a 'holy mega nice person' which i beg to disagree, it's just that everything that i do is not for me nor for my 'benefit'. i have been in love with God for almost a year and everyday seems like a day where in i am challenge to express even more how much i really love Him.   when your in love with God it's like your also inlove with a guy,you see, if you are inlove with a guy, you tend to talk about him a lot, everything he does, the minute you saw each other, you give meaning to a normal, average conversation. with God, the same thing happens, you tend to talk about Him a lot, you give meaning to his words (thru the bible), you give meaning to things he does (e.g your purpose in life).   most people see God as somebody who is hard to please, i myself sometimes find it hard, but everytime things get ugly in my life i practice 100% trust in Him. sometimes i get the itchy feeling to manipulate things on my behalf but that would only waste my time, energy and effort because i know for a fact that His Will Shall Be Done because its all about Him.        as of this moment i have three charges on my wings, and i am not nervous at all because with God nothing can go wrong.
