I'm back from Devon. That was a great week. This next bit is just random happenings from last week, some people will understand them, others won't.     CHARLIE. You get your own bit. You are such a great person. If Sidmouth happens next year, I WILL GET THAT PERSON'S NUMBER FOR YOU. Well done with the piano and compo (can you do mine for me?), and we will add more to the dance another time....    NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.    Fink Brau    Rabbit-Poo Hill    Magical Juice    Theo, I DID say goodbye to you, TWICE. I gave you two massive hugs, and when Pete told me you didn't think you did, I texted you!!!    Pete, I hope everything has sorted out.    SIDMOUTH WILL LIVE ON, we will put a pound in each, and hire a field for 1/2 hr and have our own session!!!    I have learnt, never drink Magical Juice and then drink a pint.    Ah Beh Ceh...... I've forgetten the rest. Ooh Ooh Ooh......NNNNGGGG
