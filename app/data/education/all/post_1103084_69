If I have to put on clothes one more time, I’m going to scream.    I laced up shoes, like, FOUR times yesterday.  And I wore flip flops to work!    (went to the Y, in and out of the toddler room twice, getting out of the pool and getting ready in the first place)  What a waste of a day.  Putting on SOCKS, SHOES, Zipping up pants, buckling them, buttoning up shirts.  Aargh!  Some people hypothesize that the effects of the fall of man were that nakedness became the private domain.  Being something of an exhibitionist, I’m not too fond of this explanation.   Others suggest that the fall introduced shame and clothes & nakedness are a good metaphor for this shame.  Sure, I can go with them on the clothes part at least – certainly clothes are constantly making us feel inferior.  Some say that the fall alienated us from one another (and God) and that clothes are just an expression of that alienation (which is obviously linked to the other two).  Right, right.  I certainly feel alienated. Who doesn’t?   I’m thinking that a better explanation than all of these things would be that the punishing implication of the fall was not any of the theoretical domains above, but that we would be pushed by all of *these* sociological phenomena (shame, alienation, privacy) to have the very *embodied* punishment of lacing up corsets and tennis shoes and buttoning shirts and tying ties.  All of which, notably are not extensions of these large scale human problems (sh, al, & pr) but are hybrids of their effects when mixed with the hubris of …  Dunh, dunh, dunh,   Fashion.   Aaargh.  (sorry, Elaine, I'll justify fashion in a different blog)  So, you may ask, are you, like, typing this blog while NAKED?!  Well I obviously can’t answer that question without changing the rating on the backburner….  (BTW, I am not now, nor ever have "into" wearing corsets -- I was just trying to describe a historical arc of falleness.)  Feeling free for now~
