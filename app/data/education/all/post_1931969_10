It's not news by now, but it's newsworthy.  King Otto II (i.e., Otto Rehhagel a.k.a. Otto Rehhakles), winning coach of the Greek national football team, has not abdicated his throne. He rejected the multi-million euro offer by the German football federation and decided to stay in Greece and continue the work he and his colleagues have started for 3 years now.  In other words, we will see all of you in Germany in 2006 at the Final Game of the World Championship against Germany or maybe Brazil?  Το πήραμε το ... ευλογημένο, άλλο πια, άλλο πια δεν περιμένω και το 2006 στη Γερμανία τελικό, τελικό με Βραζιλία.  Ioannis, 20040711021500
