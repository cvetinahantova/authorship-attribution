Bam-Bam is serving both the Catalog and PHPMyAdmin. I've set a placeholder PHP file that will list all the files in the directory to preview, access it at  urlLink http://bam-bam.local/~kevind/Alma%20Online%20Catalog/ .  Here you can view what we have and the emerging stylesheet.   I've also configured the stylesheet to be quite flexible.  It has classes which will allow us to set commonly-recuring style information without inline styles check out  urlLink catalog.css  for more information.  If any more styles would be helpful, let me know.
