My AVERAGE is going backwards instead of FORWARD.  Sigh....  Yes, I NEED, I WANT a wha whaa whaaambulance.... I am seriously thinking about doing something else on Monday nights.  I can barely break a score of 100 for the last two weeks.  My last game was the BEST game tonight and it was a whopping 112!  Cough.....  GAG.... I am feeling ill....  What can I do that does not require hand eye coordination ?  I need to take a cannon with me next week OR a broom stick handle so I can lash two bowling balls together.  I might hit the head pin that way.  LOL....
