Okay, I haven't attacked and I really wasn't going to.  Josh...All of that stuff I posted wasn't an attack.  Josh Rendall seems to think I attacked him in my posts regarding him.  So if you find an attack...will someone let me know?    Ambur, lol, I love you Ambur you're great.  But I really could care less what you have to say at this point.  I set out to do something.  And I am not planning on listening to you or anyone else until I've finished.  I am being true to myself something that I know a couple ppl can appreciate.
