I really can't wait to go back. Back home! Finally. It's not that hard to find a home it seems, but being smack-dabin the middle of nowhere can be rather... tedious. Maybe it's because I'll be so far away from everybody that I can think away and not worry about anything else. Away from my problems... it's like a fantasy to go back to except it's some sort of reality. It's a place to rejuvenate again and not worry. It's home. Of course, it's painful in the fact I'll be away from friends: Alex, Adam, Stu, Andrew, Fritz, Aishling... but I'll have a chance to get over other things in life, and I'll have more freedom and a breather. Isn't that what summer break's all about. And honestly, school here can really suck. Honestly, a month and a half of summer holidays? Really! Where's the sense of getting bored!? And school starts on the 18th of August... A WEDNESDAY! What are they, nuts?  Honestly! Summer is about BOREDOM. You have plenty of time to do absolutely, positively nothing, and then you can go back to school fresh and eager. I'm at the moment supposedly on the verge of entering the hardest two-year junior-and-senior high school course in teh world. A month and a half to recuperate and get my "game plan" straightened out before I enter hell!? You've gotta be kidding me!  Ah, well, but for now, HOMEWARD BOUND, baby! BTW, I'm leaving on Thursday.
