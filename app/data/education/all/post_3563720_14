Is it too much for you to handle feelings true?  Bottled animosity uncontrollable urges feeble codependency hidden in purses  Conflicts unsettled  with no clear answers nevermore meddle as our paths diverge  You were my consiglieri during my most trying moments in a world of fantasy.  Now a continent apart  with rifts irreparable I have nothing in my heart for you that is sharable  We said our goodbyes  with such angry looks from our bloodshot eyes  There will be no amends no longer are we friends  Daily reminders still exist that both of us easily list  Some future time we may talk again and no longer care of was and when.
