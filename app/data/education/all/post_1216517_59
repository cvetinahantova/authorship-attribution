In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey Butane in my veins so I'm out to cut the junkie With the plastic eyeballs, spray paint the vegetables Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose Kill the headlights and put it in neutral Stock car flamin' with a loser and the cruise control Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D Got a couple of couches asleep on the love seat Someone keeps sayin' I'm insane to complain About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt Don't believe everything that you breathe You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve So shave your face with some mace in the dark Savin' all your food stamps and burnin' down the trailer park  Yo cut it  Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? Double-barrel buckshot Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?  Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare banned all the music with a phony gas chamber Cos one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag One's got on the pole shove the other in a bag With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose job The daytime crap of a folksinger slob He hung himself with a guitar string Slab of turkey neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing You can't write if you can't relate Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate And my time is a piece of wax fallin' on a termite Who's chokin' on the splinters  Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? Get crazy with the cheeze whiz Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me? Drive-by body pierce Yo bring it on down  I'm a driver, I'm a winner Things are gonna change, I can feel it  Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? I can't believe you! Soy un perdedor I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me? Sprechen sie deutsche, baby Know what I'm saying?
