Last night entailed- finishing the History of the World Part I, Mel Brooks and Beauty and the Beast, plus some relic hunter.  Trying to catch up on my dvds before the new wave hits.  Also walked on the treadmill and cooked dinner.  Lean steak, mashed potatoes and cucumbers.  Worked on costuming for WOA, about 1/2 are cut and prepped for gluing.  Prep the other 1/2 tonight and get Phil to work on some gluing.  Things to do: Laundry AC Moore run- glue?  costuming for the mire witch Read The Taking- which I didn't get to at all yesterday :(
