Now I am thinking on how to state the main point in a topic sentence.......I know that a paragraph should be unified around a main point and the point should be clear to me first then goes to readers. According to Diana Hacker, "a good topic sentence is one sentence summary of the paragraph's main point, acts as a signpost pointing in two directions: backward toward the thesis of the essay and forward the body of the paragraph."         By looking at her definition, it is quite difficult to make a good topic sentence, but, in learning process, I have to follow the guidance as possible as I could.          My first topic sentence will be like this. Owen describes the soldiers and the conditions they are in through our sight sense such as "Bent double, like old beggars under sacks".The readers can see how the soldiers are compared in a simile to old beggars, which is not the image of soldiers in respected uniforms which would be in keeping with the glorious image of war.  I hope my topic sentence and the supporting detail given will suit the thesis statement that I formulated earlier.
