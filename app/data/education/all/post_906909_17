Been neglecting my other course, FET8601> Teaching Online: Strategies and Tactics just a bit. It's just that FET5601 has a more active online community. Really makes a huge difference in getting the involvement process going.  I've been on top of tasks so far but a little behind on the reading. Made a mistake in taking these two courses together. Kinda sheepishly read the recommendation that learners should take 5601 before 8601. Guess I was a little too keen on getting started and enrolled!   Will have more reflections on this once I get into it. Trying to figure out an efficient way to balance the two.
