urlLink The Global Hierarchy of Race : "Published on Saturday, September 20, 2003 by the Guardian/UK  The Global Hierarchy of Race As the only racial group that never suffers systemic racism, whites are in denial about its impact  by Martin Jacques   I always found race difficult to understand. It was never intuitive. And the reason was simple. Like every other white person, I had never experienced it myself: the meaning of color was something I had to learn. The turning point was falling in love with my wife, an Indian-Malaysian, and her coming to live in England. Then, over time, I came to see my own country in a completely different way, through her eyes, her background. Color is something white people never have to think about because for them it is never a handicap, never a source of prejudice or discrimination, but rather the opposite, a source of privilege. However liberal and enlightened I tried to be, I still had a white outlook on the world. My wife was the beginning of my education."
