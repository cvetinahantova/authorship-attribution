On Wednesdays   Well, I talked with Morgan about the AD&D game/Lotus Cup conflict, and we got to a sort of compromise: I'll be playing every second Wednesday. That way he'll know when I'll be playing, and I'll still get to be with me friends often enough. Well, at least things worked out. I'll have to say a prayer to The Lady for fixing that one.
