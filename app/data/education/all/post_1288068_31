Today I have to wear clothes that aren't pyjamas and say words in a logical order to make sentences. The reason for this folly? I am going to meet Lucy at  urlLink The National Gallery . Hooray! Lucy works at the gallery as a lecturer, so she got us tickets for the Russian Landscapes exhibition. I hope we get to go to the cafe too.  It is a nice day outside, which always presents me with the problem of What to Wear. When I'm on my own I will happily roam the streets in inappropriately warm clothing such as a scarf, balaclava, fur coat, wellingtons and so on, but it seems more ridiculous somehow when you're in the company of someone who is wearing a strappy vest and sandals. Hm. What? No, you don't have to listen, I was just thinking aloud.  In other news, the boy is going out with his work tonight, leaving me to eat dinner straight from the pan and drink wine until I can't get up. Ah, simple pleasures!  Goodbye.
