I hate it   That English literature class pisses me off. First of all, the professor can't spell every third word. Alchemist is NOT spelled alchlimiast! And then he rambles off all this crap about Greek theater being a cleansing experience, and that the masks they wore were to symbolize the actor hiding his true self... BULL-SHIT! Greek theater was performed at festivals to the goddess of wine, revelry, and art... they went to those festivals for a wee picnic, get drunk, find someone to go back home with and f*ck, and maybe watch what's going on on stage. And the f*cking masks were not worn to hide the actor, they were worn because you can't see an expression from half a f*cking mile away, which is where most people were (think of it as an ancient Woodstock).
