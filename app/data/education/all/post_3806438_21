Today is Old Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium so it's fun to see the Yankees trot out all the old school Yankees that we all remember.  The introductions are somewhat funny, though becuase they also invite a lot of the guys that we don't remember.  The first 15 or so guys you either don't recognize, or just don't care.  For example, at his first old timers day was the guy who had the greatest half season in history, Kevin Maas.  Also some guy named Kevin Lapointe.  It's still great to see all those guys, though, not to mention Reggie Jackson, Donnie Baseball, Yogi, Scooter, Wille Randolph, and a special treat today, Lou Piniella, who was in town with the visiting Devil Rays and participated in the tribute to Thurman Munson.  I could have gone to the game today, which would have been cool for a couple hours until you realize that you've been at the stadium since 2pm and the game is still going on at 7:30.  Maybe next time.
