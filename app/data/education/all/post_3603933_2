There's so much I could write about but I just don't have the time.  The last few days have been a whirlwind of fun and nervousness and it's not finished yet.  Within those days I had Lila for one afternoon, hung out with Suzanne, went to the doctor, had my interview, watched the Hartges kids for a night,and went into my new house for the first time.  Hanging out with Lila was a blast - we smam, went on a walk, and just hung out.  We spent a little time with Jaden and Suzanne too.  I think I could get used to this playing with kids all day thing.  My doctor told me I need to eat more salt - yes!  I love salt.    Watching the Hartges kids was cool too.  Kyle and I went over and made dinner, then the kids came home and we hung out.  They are 5 and 7.  They also have a 9 and 11 year old, but they were with their parents.    Oh yes, and the interview.  It went...alright I thought.  There were 60 applicants, and I was the 12th person she had interviewed.  Some people have already had second interviews.  I wasn't feeling to0 optimistic when the teacher who interviewed me said good-bye, but then a half hour later I got a call back to come in for a second interview.  Today at 3:00!  I'm meeting with the father of the girls.  I'll write later about how things go.  And our house...we went in last night to check it out, see what cleaning needed to be done.  The previous homeowner are awesome - they cleaned everything perfectly and it is all ready to be moved into.  It's exciting.  We might move some things today but most everything will be put in tomorrow.  It will be nice to get settled in and get all of our food unpacked.  I just ate Cheetos for breakfast (as I did yesterday) because that is really all we have in our closet.  But I have to admit, it's kind of fun.  Cheetos are good.  And they taste salty, so I'm just following doctor's orders, right?
