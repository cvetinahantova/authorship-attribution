The age of computer based testing is already here.  I personally took some of my Praxis exams on the computer.  It provided immediate feedback and was simple to use and complete.  This was on the math section of course.  Essay questions, however, are a little different.  Computers can check spelling, grammar, and layout easily.  The content and flow of ideas is a little more subjective.  I see the benefits of computer based grading - rapid return in results, accuracy of spelling and grammar, speed of test administration and cost efficiency of materials.  However, nothing replaces the need for human grading.  There will always be a need for huan testing.  Someone has to run the computers!  BC
