No matter how down I may be at any given time, Google is always a great fix.  I don't know what I would do without those guys.  I mean, when something is not working at work, I google for a fix.  When I can't remember something that I had found before, I google for it or a reminder.  And now, they have email!  Uhm... gmail!  WooHoo!   urlLink    When will they stop impressing me, by making everything so much better.  Uhhh... I hope, never.Â  urlLink
