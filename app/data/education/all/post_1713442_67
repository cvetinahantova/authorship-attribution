urlLink Library Instruction Outside of North America in the 20th Century.  Did you know that librarians outside of North America engaged in library instruction activities?  Of course you did.  Or you at least suspected as much.  Today's blogged link is a literature review of English language sources detailing library instruction programs around the world in the last century.  Abstract:  "Librarians are teaching in classrooms all over the world. A search of library literature reveals articles on academic library instruction programs in Asia, Oceania, South America, Africa, and Europe. This page will examine the 20th Century literature that explores academic library instruction programs around the world with the exception of those in North America. Only those articles that are written in English  from 1901-2000  indexed in ERIC or Library Literature are considered. As such, many relevant articles written in other languages have probably been excluded. This also may explain why some countries that use English as a primary language (Nigeria, New Zealand) are well represented while other non-English speaking countries (France) and regions (South America) are sparsely covered in this literature review."
