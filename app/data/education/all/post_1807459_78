I have a small request for the readers of this humble page.  When I'm in the PC room blogging away I usually go to this Korean page which has tons of music.  But I can never figure out what to listen too.  I have thousands of songs at my finger tips and no clue what to listen too.  In the comments section list some of your favorite songs b/c I'd like to give them a listen.
