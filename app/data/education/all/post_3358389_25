i  realized  sth today.. suddenly..  i come online everyday to look through the blogs.. once or even twice a day.. hoping to see new entries each time.. but each time, i see no new entries.. then i suddenly sub-conciously looked at it in another prospective.. i was thinking :" could the others be doing the same and that i, not writing entries disappoint them?" lol.. sudden tot made me make a decision!!!!  I decided to write at least 1 entry every 2 days.. if can, once a DAY!! :)  Hope those who rarely write entries, like me, and checks other's blogs for entries daily, like me, can see in the  PrOsPeCtIvE  i looked in,  AnD~~~ WRITE MoRe ENtRiEs!!!!  haha.. that's bt it on my  Realization ..   ha...
