As we were landing, we could see all the buildings that comprised Hong Kong. I didn't know what to expect, but since the city I had been to with the most buildings was New York, I was picturing something along those lines...and I did see that but I saw what seemed like 4 or 5 New Yorks packed into one very dense space. It was mind boggling! At the airport, we managed to find Kevin, one of the coordinators with Maryknoll whom I have known since college. It was nice to have someone there to "escort" us to the Maryknoll house, in which we had no idea how to get to. Kevin got our train tickets and got us a taxi, and before you knew it we were seeing one of the largest cities in the world pass us by. Kevin commented that in Hong Kong, buildings go one way: UP!          The Maryknoll house is very pleasant. It is located in perhaps the most "posh" area of Hong Kong. It's called the Stanley area, and most of the apartments in this area go for $5,000-$6,000/month - US dollars! There are a lot of fancy resorts around here, too. The outside of the house has a traditional East Asian architecture, while the inside feels very much like a nice college dormitory. We had arrived in time for lunch, so we joined the other volunteer teachers who had already arrived and began our first introductions. I was exhausted after not having slept at all on the plane and very little in the Incheon Airport, but when adrenaline wants to kick in, it does and I guess the human body can withstand anything.          Some people wanted to go to the beach which is just a hop, skip and jump away, so after throwing our luggage down in our "Newlywed Suite" we changed into our bathing suits and joined the rest of the gang. The beach was very crowded as it was a Sunday and the sun was showing through the hazy sky every now and again. This was my first time swimming in ocean water, and wow was it salty! It felt great to be in the water and relax, but the bottom of the water was filled with rocks, rocks that made it very difficult to walk on. In fact, later when we all had returned to the Maryknoll house, we discovered that about half of us got some type of gash on the feet! I managed to avoid a gash, but Nate got a nice one on his right foot.          After dinner Sunday evening, Nate and I went straight to bed. It was only about 8:00 pm here, but I knew I had to sleep. The next day we were to begin our orientation and training on becoming English teachers in China.          Monday through Friday was filled with many lectures, activities and opportunities to gain as much information as we could so when we all headed for the mainland to our respective universities, we had some idea on what we were getting into. There were nearly 20 of us volunteers, 9 of whom were St. Ben's/St. John's graduates, and the rest from all over - Massachussetts, Illinois, Indiana, New York...getting to know everyone in the last week has felt a lot like freshmen college orientation. We have all commented on this feeling, but yet how we're in Hong Kong overlooking the sea, so it's definitely an idyllic setting. Most of the volunteers are younger than myself, having just graduated from college and being around 22. There are a few volunteers who are well over the age of 45, too. Those of us in the "Under 26" category have enjoyed livin' it up. Please feel free to use your imagination with this. I will admit I've had some expensive drinks here in Hong Kong ($4 shots, $6 beers). Maybe this is a good time to list some very basic observations of Hong Kong:       It's a fairly expensive city - prices are pretty equivalent to any big city in the USA, and in some cases higher! There are McDonalds EVERYWHERE. As a group we've walked around and hummed the extremely irritating melody "Ba-duh-duh-duh-daaaaa...I'm lovin' it!" It is a very dense city. I can't believe how many people live in such close corners. The buildings at nighttime are gorgeous, far better than any night skyline I've ever seen in the USA - they light the buildings up in every color imaginable. There are definitely some sketchy bar areas loaded with prostitutes. The markets are packed and sell everything imaginable, but nothing so far that I've wanted badly enough to buy. I did see some cute Sesame Street figurines that I almost bought, but realized I really didn't need. The public transportation is great, but unfortunately the area that the Maryknoll house is in is on top of a hill and requires a very bumpy, windy ride down to get to where the action is. I've had motion sickness dozens of times since getting here. You see lots of European, Australian and USA folk around here - in some places it is easy to forget you're in Asia. There seem to be a lot of Indian restaurants and therefore people who live here. Restaurant employees hand out flyers and deals to sway you into eating at their restaurant. Some downright follow you and beg you to eat at their restaurant. This is one experience in which my Asian ethnicity came in handy. I didn't get nearly as many people asking me to buy stuff or eat at their restaurant as my Caucasian counterparts did. This city never sleeps. Bar time closings do not apply. I should know, last night a group of us were out past 3am and the bars were still hopping. Every street is bright and reminds me of Times Square in New York City. It truly is unbelievable.    Well, we depart for the mainland this week. Perhaps when I'm more settled there, I can write more about my new experiences in China, which is sure to be quite different than Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a touristy city, and I can easily walk around and speak English without confusing the locals. On the mainland, I'm not quite so sure that will happen. We'll see... ba-duh-duh-duh-daaaa...
