These are 2 things I wrote for our small group.  They both use the idea of Hands.  The first is a meditation and the second is intended to be an action prayer.  You clench and close fists at appropriate points.   Hands   Take a moment to admire your hands.   Look at them as a feat of engineering. Move your fingers, let them open and close, enjoy the motion of muscles and the folding of skin.  Look at the patterns held in your palm.   Survey the lines and wrinkles that have marked you so far. Trace the outlines of veins and arteries that carry life giving blood below he surface.  See the prints on the tips of your fingers.  Follow them down the rest of your hand. They are like contours on a map or rings on a tree,   This is your unique picture. A pattern that God has made for you and you only.   The Bible calls us fearfully and wonderfully made; Can you see evidence for that in your hands? Think about their ability to move, to sense, and to shape. These are tools and artworks Formed by the one who set their stars in their place. And they are yours. No-one has a pair like these, they're one of a kind.  Our hands show the greatness of our creator and our significance to him.  Often it is our hands that show what it is to be God breathed. With these hands we create, we write, we cook, play and work. As we do each of these we exercise our role as little Gods,  reflections of his Glory, his greatness, his creativity.  Can you see the signs of toil on your hands? Cuts, Scars and Callouses all show us that this world is hard. They remind us that we're not yet home. We strive, we suffer, we fall.  How have you used these works of wonder today? Have you created or destroyed?  Fed or taken?  Greeted or turned away? Have your hands been part of his story, or part of another?  Imagine your hands held in another's. These are bigger, more capable, and stronger. These hands set planets in motion and shape each new life.  Yet they are also scarred and worn. They bear the piercings of love and the marks of death.  As well as the power of resurrection. Allow these hands to enfold your own.  Let your hands be taken and held by his.   Clenched Fists   As we clench our fists we remember that we are stubborn and resistant to you. We seek to go our own way and often rebel.  And so we open our hands to ask for forgiveness, To release our own plans, and to surrender our will.  As we clench our fists we recognize our potential for anger. To fight, to scare. We can be part of the mob and as we clamour for justice, for rightness, for revenge we can easily destroy your world.  So we open our hands to show our weakness. We are small and vulnerable We cannot carry grudges We have no score to settle.  As we clench our fists we remember the times we have refused to give. We have turned away strangers, We have denied aid and sort to keep your blessings to ourselves.  So we open our hands to give and receive. To accept your gifts and pass them on. To welcome neighbours and to be channels of your grace.  As we clench our fists we recognize our tendency to fight our corner To go it alone and to bash out a way. �Its us against the world�, we say as we try to succeed through strength.  So we open our hands to let go. We give our struggles to you. We receive you're cool balm.  Holy spirit anoint our hands,  Heal our wounds, Give us your power. And let our hands work, together, for you.
