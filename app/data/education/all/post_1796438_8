How was today? I'm asking myself that question as I type. I'd say somewhere between crap and semi-crap. Not very productive, that's for sure. I fell asleep during the movie in geography, probably not a good thing considering the stuff on there is certain to be in the test on Wednesday, Week 5. Still, I had seen the movie before (Turning the Tides) and it was spoken by this irritating British guy. And I literally didn't do anything during English Lit either. I have to type up all the quotes from Oedipus that relate to conscience, but I can only find one and I can't be bothered reading it again to pick out all of the other forms of the word. I'll do it Sunday night I guess.  Is it just me or are the days getting longer and longer? For the second day in a row I thought school had finished when there was still one lesson to go. at least I realised I had another class left today, unlike yesterday when I had walked 20 metres home before realising there was no one else with me.  I had a weird dream last night. I dreamt that I was doing the Geometry and Trigonometry test again, but I was really tired. The next day I got an absolute shit score. I ooked back and on the essay where my conclusion should have been there was a message involving some or all of the words "work", "ban", "night time", "sleep". The gist of it was that I was so tired I fell asleep during the test. I also missed out on writing the answer to a really easy question two pages back because I was going to do that after the essay. While this may seem strange (essays in a G&T test?!?!) it's freakishly true. Today I did fall asleep during something I'll need for a test, and I got my Physics assignment back, losing the most marks in my conclusion. Maybe I'm psychic in my deams? Freaky.
