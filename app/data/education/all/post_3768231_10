Birthdaft  ... just a quick one... turning 40 aint all it's cracked up to be.... there's no flashing lights, telegrams from the Queen, visitations from extrateresstrials... nothing like that - thank gawd! I took the  boys  out for lunch, and Alex wanted to come home with me (sob!). It was great to be with them - as always. I had a nap this arvo, and had a very realistic dream of sailing with my dad (which we did for years when I was a young teenager etc). I awoke with tears streaming down my face! It's amazing, isn't it? After over 8 years, I still really miss him. A plus was that my final  George Johnston  book arrived, " The Darkness Outside " - that's the one I was waiting for! Whoo hoo! And finally... I also received " The Fisher King " on video - one of those quirky films that i absolutely love - can't describe it, just know that I love the whole feel of it. Did I spend the day/arvo/evening on the turps? Nope, didn't touch a drop - didn't feel like it! It's fucking horrible being alone on your birthday - even my flatmate left this morning to spend the w/end with her folks down the coast! So, home alone! lol. Oh well, life is... interesting! At least I can play my XTC, Rolling Stones and Beatles CD's bleedin' loud! Listening to "Please Please Me" even as I speak - gees, that's even older than I am - only just! pmsl!
