Wow, lots of stuff happening this week. Danny just told me that I'm not going to singing this quarter and possibly ever again. He said that there are so many singers so he has to not use some of them. He said that it didn't have anything to do with my singing ability. I just want to cry though because I looked forward to my times singing with the worship team, I really enjoyed getting to know each and every one of them. I just feel like I am losing something so precious to me. I still can sing with the youth so that is comforting but what happens when I am to old for that? I almost already am. Well here we go onto a different phase of my life, and I want to keep my head up and trust God that though this isn't easy he knows what he is doing. Lord: please help me to trust you for everything that is going on but especially for my job and singing with the worship team.
