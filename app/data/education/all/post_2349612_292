750 miles round trip this weekend and i'm back in jersey:  the short version? *road construction stinks *farmers markets provide the best cheapest lunch ever *it's weird to have a bit more of grandma "missing" every time i visit... i did a lot of thinking *"the notebook" is a very good movie *i got to meet my mom's best friend from high school... *that* was entertaining *highlight of today?  cleaning off my grandpa, my uncle, and my great grandparents headstones at the huge 100s of acres big cemetary in pittsburgh *i really like chatting with my aunt priscilla  that said, the long version comes later  happy evening dudes
