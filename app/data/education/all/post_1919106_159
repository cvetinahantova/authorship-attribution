Well, the financial part got mostly sorted out, so I can breathe for now. That's the good news. The bad news is that tomorrow I have to proctor a final, and then the day after I'll probably spend all afternoon grading. Until then, I'm going to take a good nap. And read more of that fantabulastically entertaining book I've been rambling about yesterday. And nap some more. Maybe eat something. Oh, you're still there? I'm done. You can stop reading. I mean it. Stop. Reading. You just won't stop, will you? That's it, I'm pulling the plug. Seriously. I will. You just watch me.
