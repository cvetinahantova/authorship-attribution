Bit of a rant coming up... apologies in advance...  Like everyone elso I've see the pictures of the guy seeking asylum whose gone on hunger strike and was made to feel quite sick by it.  What kind of a country are we to turn away people who are obviously so traumatised and desperate as he was.  The whole anti asylum seeker paranoia has really got me fuming right now.  Why are people, many of whome have very legitimate reasons for wanting to come to Britain, like torture we'll never know or poverty beyond our understanding, demonized not just by the media but (supposedly) by rational people.  What kind of a country are we?  It makes me ashamed, particularly as we have been spending billions on a war to get rid of weapons that may or may not have existed.  Sometimes it seems like everything is upside down.    But its so easy to leave it at that isn't it?  To say its all upside down but its not my fault.  How do we act, how do we make a difference?  There must be something more than shrugging and accepting the status quo.  I think there is,  over the Bank Holiday I went to Saltaire, a Victorian Village in Yorkshire.  This place had been built by a wealthy mill owner in the industrial revolution to get his workers out of the filthy conditions in industrials and into a community, once he'd built them decent houses, a church, a boating house and a village green he moved many people in.  Now the village was built along the lines of a Victorian Middle Class Man's rural ideal and I don't know how perfect he was but the story really got me.  Here was one man who did not accept that life was the way it was and that was the end of it.  He devoted himself to providing a better alternative.  That's how I'd like to be remembered.
