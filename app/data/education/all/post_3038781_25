How long should the mourning period for  Angel  last?   I can't believe that it's ended. It has ended? Has it ended?  Well, bye bye WB because whoever picks up Angel, picks up me.  Ohhhh, that was too close to the line that Angel needed to rephrase.   But what about the ending? To have signed away his 'right' to turn human again?  I loved that last little bit about the dragon slayer... it really fits...  and Spike finally getting back to poetry in what looked like a beat-biker bar.  How perfect. Who would have thought you could find a rhyme for "my heart has a bulge in it". And, Connor's line "So, you come to have coffee-- And the world's not coming to an end? Right" [that's a poor paraphrase, but it's still a good line]. But then Lorne's exit and Wesley's - the commercials said their would be one that won't come back, but which is it? (And does that presume that the others will come back on one channel or another). Almost everyone on the show has died at least once if not multiple times so Wesley's death after being a vessel for major 'mojo'- may not be a certainty. And, I'm still not certain that there isn't a trace of fred left in Aleria to come back (as a spinoff?).   But here's a question... where was the promised final key to Angel's destiny?  There's almost a paradox there, in the idea of signing away his destiny to become human?  If he does, then -particularly with spike on-scene- could the prophecy really have been about him? And, if not, then could he sign away a right he didn't have to begin with? And would the powers that be enforce a contract signed essentially under duress for the purposes of forwarding the Power's own interests?
