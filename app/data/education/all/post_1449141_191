Action Update Administration to Move Forward with New Nukes  The President and Congress are moving forward with reckless plans to develop new nuclear weapons.

Votes fell along party lines as both the House and Senate recently repealed a ban on research into low-yield nuclear weapons. Legislators also voted to explore development of a powerful "bunker buster" nuclear bomb. These provisions were part of a record $400 billion defense authorization bill that was passed in late May. Congress will settle differences in conference over the House and Senate versions of the bill later this month.
