dude!  so we have our first snowfall of the year here in NJ -- party indeed!  and like check out the current weather channel radar for the area:       it's gonna still be going for forever yet, and that's AWESOME!  we've probably gotten 3 to 4 (maybe a hair more) inches today so far (it's been snowing non-stop since before i woke up at 11:30!) and they say another 2 to 4 tonight, 4 to 7 tomorrow, and another inch tomorrow night after that -- absolutely insane, but snow has to be my absolute favorite weather of all time! =)  i woke up today in time to shovel out my car and get to campus for pizza seminar.... was going to turn in my complex final to the prof. in his office but caught him just as he was leaving the building (any later and i woulda had to mail the durn thing to him... blah, so i cut it close!)  after that, scott wanted to go to his bank and i needed to go to mine -- this should be a 30 minute round trip on a normal day, but it took us a full 2 hours plus some to get there and back in the crazy weather and crazier traffic... after that, i caught up with eric for a quick dinner on campus and to go to an orchestra concert he wanted to go to, neither of us considering it would be cancelled in the snow, which of course it was... so that was another 45 minutes in the car, stopped by starbucks on the way home and sat for maybe half an hour, and finished our 40 minute drive back to campus... finally home (after another half an hour drive that normally takes 10 minutes!) and here i stay til tomorrow. =P  yay for snow anyhow =P  tomorrow going to see 42nd street  on  42nd street in manhattan =P... should be fun =)  in the meantime, i've absolutely tired myself out this week -- going to watch whatever my roommate has on the TV with her and finish writing my other 56 out of 100+ christmas cards until i fall asleep... sounds like fun, eh? =P  later
