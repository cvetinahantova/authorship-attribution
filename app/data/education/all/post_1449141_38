Holtzer R, Wegesin DJ, Albert SM, Marder K, Bell K, Albert M, Brandt J, Stern Y.  Sergievsky Center, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.  BACKGROUND: Previous studies revealed that cognitive test scores were related to functional outcome in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the relationship between the rate of cognitive decline at the initial disease phase and the risk of reaching clinical milestones in subsequent years has not yet been examined. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the rate of cognitive decline predicts the risk of reaching functional milestones in patients with probable AD."
