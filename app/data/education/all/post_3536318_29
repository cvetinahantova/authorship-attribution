WOOHOO!!!  Nothing like taking a month off of work, because they have no work to offer you!    Well, it isn't THAT bad, except that fact that now I have all this free time to do things, and no money to do it with!    So, I'm playing alot, reading alot, and sleeping alot.  Not so bad, until you start getting sick of your apartment.  And it's so bloody hot outside, that reading under a tree will inevitably give you heat stroke.    Maybe I should start knitting, or something.  Any ideas?
