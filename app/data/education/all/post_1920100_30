Well I'm back. Sorry I didn't finish writing it's because we went to go get some sodas with my cousins because her husband made a carne asada. He works at a meat market so he brought over some good meat and chorizo...yum I was craving tacos for a long time. I remember when we use to get together on Saturday mornings all my dad's family to make carnitas. It was usually to celebrate someones birthday or someone from Mexico coming over. I mostly enjoyed it because we were all spending time together. My dad works a lot so I treasure all those moments he's around.   Well to finish my story the reason why I had a good day at work was because I had an opportunity to teach the students that I will do my next long term for. This class is an English immersion class but there is 4 students that don't speak English. (so in a sense it is still a bilingual class b/c i will explain to them in spanish for them to understand). I really enjoyed this class because they are motivated to learn and they are more independent than the other class I taught. It was so cool because the students were writing in their journal and when they were done I asked three students randomly to read what they wrote and one girl wrote about me. She wrote, today Ms. Larios taught us she is nice I like her. That brought a smile to my face. I was like I have only been here for a while and she wrote about me! It impressed me. The day went well I had no behavior problems. yey Today is a busy day for me. I am going over to my bro's house because they are celebrating his wifes b-day, my other brothers triplets b-day and mother's day all in once. After I am meeting up with some girls from church because we are having a girls night. We are having a spa night. We are going to do our nails, talk and pray together. I am really looking foward to this. I'll let you know how it goes.
