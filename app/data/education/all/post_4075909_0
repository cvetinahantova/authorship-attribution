What do you get when you mix 200mg of Celebrex with 1000mg of aspirin plus Tamgent? You got it! An overdose! My mother turned into Judy Garland last night. She had heartburn from chicken and decided to take aspirin to get rid of a headache. OOPPS! Don't worry, she's fine. I am the family doctor. Not that I carry around a degree or anything, but I think I know more than the doctors since they almost killed me three years ago. It's annoying how I don't forget these things. ANYWAY, I did watch City of God and highly recommend the film. I also saw In America and I have to say, I guess I'm the Grinch because I didn't like this film at all, it was too inconsistent and altogether lame.  That film tried to make me cry and I guess I'm made out of stone.  OH WELL.  And here's an idea.  If a film takes place in 1982, (I'm talking of In America), in NYC, please when one gets to Times Square, don't have Mama Mia! playing at the Winter Garden.  Cats was there in '82, right after Othello.  Thanks director!
