So it finally happened.. my computer has gone completely insane..  it's sad that i dont have anything to talk about other then i have 2 more days left to babysit and i'm thanking God for that. anyway a normal person wouldn't have even bothered to post today.. but since when am i normal? i decided if i didn't have this i would probably go insane, this allows me to babble with out interruption.. yay..  anyone read The Da Vinci Code? i read like the first 3 chapters or so. and i definetly need to add that to my bookshelf. so far it seems really cool.  ~~Teri-- i dont have to go to my site to set up, i talked to Connie about all that stuff the other day. i just have to go to the classes. i was talking about enrollment on the 10th you drk.
