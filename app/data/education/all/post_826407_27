I recently wrote to  urlLink H&M   asking about their policies about social responsibility.  The brochure that they sent back had this quote from Rolf Eriksen the CEO.  "At H&M we always focus on our customers and over the past few years, we have clearly seen that our customers are getting more and more involved in such issues as the environment and social responsibility.  Our own employees are also becoming increasingly interested in these issues.  This has convinced me that it is important for H&M to be committed to it's responsibilities in these areas to retain the confidence of our customers and employees in the long term."  It would be easy to be cynical about such statement but I don't want to.  I want to believe that things can change for the better and that maybe even corporations can be persuded to act responsibly.  I want to believe that we can make a difference so this gave me hope.  H&M's full code of contact can be found at their website.
