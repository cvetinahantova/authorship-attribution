Just today only a realization struck me.........somehow I have lost track of life. Every second is passing by and i have just stopped worrying ab8 the preciousness of every instance that i am losing.The sand of time is just slipping out of my fingers giving me the insight of being a looser!!! I am, what i didnt expect out of life..what i didnt want to be..but now since i am what i am then i have to give the best to what i am and make sure to c how good can i be. I need more commitment towards life, more commitment towards what i do, more seriousness in my work, in thoughts……running away from life,from responsibilities, from realization  …is not like me!!! Once certain things need to be done they are to be done with all the best that I have to offer and I need to enjoy every bit of it….how can I just keep on convincing myself that whatever is happening is not what I want and still passing my precious days doing the same….either I must quit or I must end up doing better…enjoy ur work,ur life and b the best..coz this is the key to success and success will have to come to u as ur reward…so better get going!!!
