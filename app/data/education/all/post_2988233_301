I added a couple of new things to the blog. First is the countdown to election day.  Its on here to remind every one to vote. Yeah, I would really like it if we all voted for Bush, but I would like it even more if every one jsut exercise their right to vote. Too many of our soldiers have given their lives for us to have the freedoms we have in this country. They are sacrificing times with their own families to protect our shores. The least we can do is get off our butts and go vote.  The second thing I added is a Bush/Cheney news blog box. Yes, it is biased, but click on a few links, you may learn something you didn't know before.  There are also new links on my blogroll, AND I started a photoblog over at buzznet.You can leave comments on each pic, so take a look, and let me know what you think!    Can you tell I was bored last night??????
