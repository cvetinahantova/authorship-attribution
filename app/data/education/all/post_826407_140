There are several things that God seems to be challenging me to do right now, so for my own good I will record them here (I will use the second person but only because I am addressing myself.  Do not think, dear reader, that I am trying to preach at you).  Make space in your life to connect with your God and follow your dreams.  Do not allow yourself to be completely sucked in to doing things for money, security or recognition.  Connect with others on journeys.  Make friends, let them help you when you fall, help them when they do.  Stop trying to do things alone  Live the way you talk, and talk about the things you dream of doing.  Seek truth and accept it when you find it.  You don't have to question everything.  Shun cynicism, it is heart-death.  Fight; you are in a battle so do not give in but remember you are not fighting people.  On the whole you are fighting for them.
