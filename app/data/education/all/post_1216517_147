GOD BLESS THE SOUTHLAND  I'm reading about the ten plagues.  Man, would that suck to be on the wrong side of that.  Frogs, flies, lice, boil, darkness.  All that stuff.  That's like living in California.  Floods, fires, mudslides, earthquakes. riots.    I can't help but laugh at people's impression of California back in Michigan. - "Yeah, I'll fall into the ocean some day."   Huh?  That sounds like some kind of Monty Python skit.  But I'm serious, people say that.  - "All those earthquakes, I could never live out there."  I've lived out here 5 and a half years and felt one tiny earthquake.  Hello?  Blizzards anyone?  Tornadoes?  - "California.  That's filled with gays."  I don't know really what about this comment, except, yeah.  I think California is 9/10ths gay.  -  "All those Mexicans out there..."  Again, i don't know.  There same peopel that say this, eat Taco Bell by the barrel full.  Well, I can say this, when I went to Utah a little while back, I was kinda nervous because there were so many white people around.  It was kind of spooky actually.  Anyways, God bless Ah-nold, and God bless the Southland.
