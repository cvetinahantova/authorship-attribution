Yeah, today was fun. I scrubbed away every little speck of dirt in my bathroom, and it is now startlingly clean... bright white and whatnot. It's crazy.  Anyway, I now have a french pen pal, so I'm less out of the loop, although I've only recieved one response as of yet. Ah, oui! Heheh...  Yeah, but I was playing with BSPlayer today, and I got some really cool screenshots from music videos... I don't really know why, but I did. Maybe I'll play with them in PhotoShop now...  Well, not now I won't, because I'm going to bed. Maybe tomorrow.  Current Music: Presidents of the United States of America - Peaches
