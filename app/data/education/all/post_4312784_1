Hello bloggy. Below is an email from Mr Chin to all of us. =D   Hi all       Thank you very much for the effort put in for this year's Senior Bible Quiz. God is good to us - the 3rd place in West District is a pleasant surprise, and a reward from God for all the hard work. Thanks especially to Jeffrey who stood up to get the team together.       To the team members - Xin Mao, Lek Wei, Jun Rong and Sean, thank you too. Hope you all had fun. And to Jun Rong who initially didn't want to take part, hope you will be the first to sign up next year.       And to Big Madam, captain, Justin and Dennis - thank you for standing in when I was not available for the training sessions. And to Wen Wei, and the rest of the Sec 2 and above Boys, thank you for joining us in the training sessions as well. And to everyone to supported us with your prayers - thank you too.       It has been fun. May this be the start of a collection of Bible Quiz prizes for the 28th from now on.     Who says studying the Bible is boring and unrewarding? Come join the BB cells every Sunday - we will make it fun!  Thanks be to God.       Can Jun Rong's squad leader show him this email - he doesn't have an email account.
