Hey! whoa ya it's like weird! it's like i'm confused about something but i dunno what i'm confused about! it just feels like i'm confused about something like it's way far back in my mind that i'd just have to sit and think awhile to figure out what it was!.... weird huh well yup if you haven't figured that out already then haha! it's true! but yup yup anywayz... you know i strongly believe that everything happens for a reason... God brings people into your lives and God takes em out for a reason...sometimes you meet a person and it's just like ugh why! but ya i dunno maybe that sounds mean but it's complicated i guess.... I was also thinking... When people think of me... What do they think? is it nice... Do they think of me as a Spoiled brat? i hope not... sometimes when peeps think that it's like ugh i wish i didn't have any of it cuz yes i know i have nice things... but i hope i don't act like a spoiled brat because if i am PLEASE TELL ME that's the last thing i wanna come across as... sheesh where is this post goin? i have no idea but anywayz ya... ttyl!
