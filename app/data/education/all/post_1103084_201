. kill bill (spoiler: don't read) .  at the beginning of the movie, Uma / Beatrix says -- I'm going to kill Bill.   throughout the whole movie (and i'm referring to both as one, because that's what they should've been/are -- though i probably wouldn't  have gone to see a 4.5 hour movie), she works toward the opportunity to kill Bill.  (although it gets less clear about how/why she had to kill the entire Deadly Viper Assasin Squad in order to get to Bill.  Why didn't she just start with him?)  In the previews she says, you bet i'm going to kill bill.   so how!? how?! how in the world -- does the major dramatic question which continues to keep us interested manage to be: will beatrix kill bill?   it seems a little bit brilliant.
