here's a poem for you- the last did not concern you, the one on the fridge...  please accept the truth i don't want to be with you i deserve better  things got out of hand we did things we shouldn't have but it meant nothing  why do you doubt me? addicted to touch, not you so full of yourself  i do care for you... i love you, but as a friend too bad you can't see  you know so little you'll never understand me and vice versa  wish we could go back i'm sorry we ever touched it ruined you and i  we've drifted apart uncomfortable with me keep squeezing me out...  if that's what it takes for you to have peace of mind and to live with it  but i plead with you, please don't give up on me yet we are both broken
