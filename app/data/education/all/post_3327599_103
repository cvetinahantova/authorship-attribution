~~for those of you that it matters to (the ones i was supposed to enroll with lol)--- i got my schedule for work, and i have a class 11-4 on the 10th so i wont be able to do breakfast before.~~ ~~Teri-- are we hookin' up that morning?? if so, we are need to make random lines again!! that was sooo funny.. i'll bring a table if i have to.. ~~  so those freakin' kids are making me insane... they never hear the word no and think " i have no money" means maybe i'll buy something else for you just not that. now i feel bad bugging my mom when she gave me that excuse. we got to go to the mall tho so it's ok, we spent almost 2 hours in Limited Too. that was fun... then i got followed around by a very butch security gaurd. which was odd.. maybe she thought i was hott? i dunno... anyway i talked to the guy in sun coast for awhile mainly because i think Phil and i were rude to him the other night maybe we weren't and i just think we were... who knows... anyway.. i was just being polite. that dvd collection of friday the 13th is $130. that's insane.  anyway, now i get to rant about Connie!! she told me i'm in charge of art (no complaints from me, Ashley and i hid back there all the time anyway), and in her words i "get to be Julie all year since she wont be with us again". maybe it's just me that finds that "you be so and so" thing funny... you'd have to know Connie...
