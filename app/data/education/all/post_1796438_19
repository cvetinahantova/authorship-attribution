Hello? Is this thing on?  A very big strong 'ello to all you funky people out there!   It is I! MORGAN *crowd goes wild*   Okay, my new house is...okay and my room is...small but very clean thanks to the influence of TONYA! Thanks babe!   Only other important thing is that I SAW LORD OF THE RINGS! YAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH *inhale* HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  Okay, I'm done...BUT IT'S REALLY GOOD!   Okay! Love you all babes and Tonya (who is the coolest) and Haydy-Poo!  Love Morgan  P.S: I have decided that I will put quotes after everthing I write...first quote for the loud crowd is a message that Aragorn (he is so cool!) says to the men of Middle-Earth outside the Black Gates to lift their spirits for a battle that they can't win...A battle to give Frodo time...(on the Movie):   "A day may come when the courage of men fails. When we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day. This day we fight!"
