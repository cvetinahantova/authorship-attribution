urlLink Mathematics Achievement in Rural Schools. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Craig B. Howley.  From the ERIC Digest:  Rural communities need an infrastructure of good mathematics knowledge, according to some observers. Moses and Cobb (2001), in particular, argue that mathematical knowledge will, in the new century, figure as a path to political and cultural power, much as the capacity to read and write served in the 19th and 20th centuries.  What is the baseline of mathematical knowledge among students in the rural United States? Poverty in nonmetropolitan areas exceeds that in metropolitan areas (Jolliffe, 2002), and, for this reason, one might reasonably suspect that mathematics achievement in rural schools is depressed as compared to the national average. Is this really the case? This Digest assesses the best evidence available and concludes with recommendations for further action, based in part on conclusions reached by a national effort to develop new research about mathematics education in rural places.
