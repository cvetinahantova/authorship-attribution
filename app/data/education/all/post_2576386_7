My new job is a little interesting.  It's totaly different from what I've learned in school.  Not only because I am a Fine Arts graduate and being in-charge of discipline to at least 600 students or so and the classroom management of 30 teachers is different but more so because I was a teacher's nightmare in elementary and high school.  Well, not entirely true.  I was also loved by some. The thing is, being an outstanding student, I was not.    Anyway, I was reading the cases of students placed under Strict Disciplinary and Disciplinary Probations knowing that they will be the first cases I will be looking at come opening day of classes, I was contemplating why these students were placed in such a predicament.  I can only look back and think of the days I was still a student.  (And that was a long long time ago.)  What prompted me to do what I did that caused me too much trouble? I can only think of one basic answer:  "Blame it on my youth."  In other words, I didn't know any better.  And yet, I know I cannot use this as an excuse to errant students.  I am here to guide them. Teach them how to live in a world that is full of rules, follow a strict conduct of morals, ethics, etc... in other words, everything I rebelled in during my heyday.  Ah, this is going to be a tight journey. All I can say to myself is "brace yourself, man. Hold on to the rails so that you don't get thrown out of the ship."
