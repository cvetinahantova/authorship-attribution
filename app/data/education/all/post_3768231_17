I've found this great free site which
 hosts all your pics and gifs for your website. It's not like a public
 'photo gallery' or anything like that, but rather like a site to store your images and link
 them from this remote server. It's gonna save a lot of space in my
 normal webpage server, and the images will load a whole lot faster as
 well! It took a few hours to do it all properly, but I've done it the one and only time I'll ever have to do it!  Whoo hoo!
