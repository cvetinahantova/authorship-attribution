"Life is a trail... We follow our own trail with trials and tribulation. This is not the end. We had just started our beginnings of no where to end. Please don't let us down. Don't lose our hopes for uncertainty... Believe me. This is our journey which we have yet more to discover. Don't let your strength down. Hold it as if you don't want to let it go. We can make our own adventure by surpasssing out our dreams and thoughts to be true... We are meant this way but we'll make it happen anyway..."         I saw devastating faces today. I know that it is hard to accept a failure. I've been through it once and I am preparing my self not to do it again though it is hard. Please don't give up!! Dear friends: I love all of you. Having it through or not is not important to me because now that I learnt the value of friendship which is not the same as the value of money.        Sarip - I know it is hard for you.. I know that. I don't know why I care so much about you. Maybe because I don't want to leave this place without you. We are childhood friends... We were apart for so long that when I met you again, I just don't want to let you leave... I missed seeing your smiles and receiving your miss calls... Please smile tomorrow for me?? Or at least let me know that you are doing okay...        The meeting with Principal started @ 11.15 a.m. First it was the teacher whose talked so much about the recent and coming exams... I was glad that I did pretty well until I was kind of 'proud' of my self... The principal called out my name, telling that I was the best student in class... heheh :) ... He told me that I could be better next time. I was expecting him to call out someone else's name but he didn't. Then Azratul's name was called-out by him to recognize the whole students that we both are role models of the repeaters... heheh :)        "I don't think that I am good enough to be alive. I have few things to be sorted. I am blind. I am folded and I am magnified. Life is not easy by the thoughts I had made it was. But today I just realized that I am good to be me. Thank you for praying for my safety and success. All of the faiths you had given me will always be my remembrance... Thank you for having me for who I am inside and outside..."         Then I met Izzah & Tuty after that. We took pictured together. I'll upload it later when I have the time because the laptop is still unattached to the main switch.. Okay, that ends my blog for today. I am extremely tired of exhaustion. I'll upload the lad's pic later... By the way, I am having my qualifying exam this week. Probably I will not be updating any blogs till September... Wish me luck~ Opps... before I forgot, Happy 16th birthday to my cousin, Nizar... May God bless you and fulfilled your wished to be true... heheh :) ...        p/s: Please smile for me tomorrow?? Let this be your trial and take me as your challenge... Mark my words!
