Today has been a cumulative hangover day- one of those ones where you wake up feeling okay and slowly get worse throughout the day until, by 4 o’clockish, you feel like someone has scooped out your brain with a spoon and poured some molasses and gravy in instead, and then spiked your coffee with valium.  Last night’s party fun went down at The Ten Bells in Shoreditch, which is one of those fashionably manky pubs (or ‘shithole chic’, if you prefer) that’s full of mouldering furniture and bemulleted folk in camouflage clothing. We had the upstairs room, which Anna managed to fill with a whole bunch of her mates, plus assorted hangers-on dragged in by me and Hav. We had cake and iced gems and party rings and pink wafers, washed down with lashings and lashings of beer. And a good time was, I think, had by all. I certainly enjoyed myself, anyway. Here’s wishing my little sister a happy birthday for tomorrow.   My physical condition has put work out of the question for today. I went to the park for a bit with Nils but I found that outside was a bit fresh-airy and overpopulated so I went back indoors after an hour.   School tomorrow seems like a distant dream. I might ‘forget’ to set my alarm and just sleep on through till lunchtime. Do you think that would constitute ‘cause for concern’?
