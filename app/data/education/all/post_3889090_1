My darling.  I don't deserve to be with you. I have many problems and am dark in my core. I've been looking at pictures of girls violating their beauty and I enjoyed it. Every picture I've ever looked at has violated our sacred marriage covenant. Every time I've looked lustfully at some woman, I've commited adultery with her in my heart. Every time I've done it, I've compromised our marriage and disrespected you.   So I pledge to you before God, that from tonight I will make every effort not do do this again, not to violate you and other girls and not to sin against God.  I don't know how I will do this but I pray that God gives me strength and guidance.    I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
