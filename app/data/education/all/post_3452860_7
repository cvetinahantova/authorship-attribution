How timely!  A good friend has sent me the link to an extraordinary gathering of thoughts for the 40th anniversary of McLuhan’s seminal work that began with the most provocative aphorism ever to strike our inquisitive minds on the topic of new media, “The medium is the message.” (Also, “The medium is the massage.” A playful turn of phrase demonstrating McLuhan’s penchant for language.)      Forty Years of Understanding Media: A Symposium  At the 2004 Social Sciences and Humanities Federation Academic Congress at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, on June 4th, 12:30 -  2 PM, The McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto and the McLuhan Global Research Network, in partnership with the Association of Media Ecologists North, InSounds McLuhan Oral history project, and other interested participants, will celebrate the 40th anniversary of publication of Understanding Media: The extensions of man.  urlLink more    urlLink  Read book on-line
