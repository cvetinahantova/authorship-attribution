I tried some cold-infused iced tea today.  We've been talking about on the teaswap pages.  I tried it with some lemony gunpowder green.  It said use a handful.  I used three.  It still could've been stronger as far as I was concerned.  I've realized I enjoy strong tea, both iced and hot.  If I do this again, which I could, cause it's super east.  I would probably use another handful.
