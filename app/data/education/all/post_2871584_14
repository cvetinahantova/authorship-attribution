Did you ever notice that when you know you won't have something much longer, it suddenly becomes so much more important?  Why is this?  Why does it take that potential of loss before we realize how important things truly are?  It's funny.  Now that I'm "officially" leaving, everyone is making such a big deal out of it.  Now it's not just getting together here and there.  It's "We have to go out together after work tonight--you won't be here much longer."  It's not "Want to watch a movie sometime?"  It's "Let's watch a movie tonight."  And everyone seems required to tell me how important I am to them and how much they're going to miss me.    It's not that I mind any of these things.  In fact, I find them flattering.  But... why does it have to take such drastic situations for us to do these things in our lives?  Life is so short.  Why can't we tell people how important they are every day?  Why can't we make time for each other all the time?  Why can't ... Ok, the sappiness has ended.  But seriously, I feel like I should take a look around me, and remember all of the good things that I have going.
