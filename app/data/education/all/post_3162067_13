Just a quick post before I run into town to do battle with WHSmiths and try to get them to replace my printer cartridge for free (ink won't come out any more). I have to disguise the fact that it's been lying around the house for a couple of months, but that's not the point; it didn't work before then anyway. Going to go for a drink with Si when he finishes work. Feel very tired, but quite content at the moment. Nice weekend coming up, and I've just had a good day at work. All is good with the world.
