Well, since Lock Up was out of the question, we were on a quest to find another place to eat and we were all quite hungry. All of a sudden an idea popped into my head.  Last fall I had been to a garlic restaurant for Laura's birthday and the food was quite good.  The only problem was that now I had to find it again and when I left that other time we had been having a nomihodai (all you can drink with a set course brought out) and so I wasn't exactly paying much attention to where we were.  Anyway, I successfully found it!!!  The food was just incredible.  There were so many things we wanted to try.  We ended up with some pasta, garlic toast, shrimp in a garlic hot chili sauce, cheese fondue, karubi steak, and really spicy fried rice.  It was definitely SHIAWASE (just a complete state of happiness).  I don't think I have enjoyed any other meal in Japan the way we all enjoyed this one.  We would eat one thing and then rave about it only to do the same thing for the next item.  Our table was definitely crowded as the dishes were in the center and we each had our own collection of little bowls since you put each thing in a different little dish as to not mix things.  Stuffed, we decided to go bowling and had quite a good time there as well.  Definitely a fun, relaxing night out with the girls!!!
