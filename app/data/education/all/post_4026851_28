It's been a day of firsts at the ol' homestead.  The little brother endured/is currently enduring:   - his first ever soccer practice  Mom reports that soccer ain't his bag.  My fat little buddy kicks like a sissy and can't run sprints (he gets tired  real  quick).   -his first ever loose tooth  Looks like the first to fall out will be one of the front bottom four.  Big brother took great delight in telling the horrified little turd that each and every one of his teeth is going to fall out (I failed to mention that he'd be getting a replacement set).   -his first ever bout of constipation  Sunday afternoon was the poor guy's last successful sitdown.  Early today he proudly proclaimed, "I haven't stinkied in three days!"  But...  labor pains kicked in this evening, so he's been on the can trying his damnedest all night.  I tried to inspire him with the story of my own childhood jamup adventure... which culminated in a Macguyver-esque enema (turkey baster full of soapy water) injected up my dumper by dear-old Dad.  It wasn't enough, though, as he was still grunting and bawling in agony when Dad got home from work at 10.  Dad entered the bathroom and cheerled to little avail, then proceeded to further hype the up-the-butt final solution.   And yet another reason why I love my little brother: after having been warned (the umpteenth time) of the impending anal invasion if he can't lay some pipe by tomorrow, my brother turned to a higher power.  He asked us "how long will it take if I pray?"   I pray for millions... he prays for a painless poop.  Gotta love it.
