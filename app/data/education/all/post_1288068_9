Woo! I am in the midst of a mindbending standards marathon. Have got three pages-worth so far. Only another  -  bastard!  -  three to go. Can anyone think of a way I can prove that I respect children and am concerned about their learning?* Hm.  In related news, why don't you go on over to the copyright-hell that is my  urlLink online gallery  and marvel at Peter and his miniassociates?  My fingers are fine now, thanks. Do be careful when you are washing glasses, though.  Two weeks left! x  * Imagine if there were special government agents whose job it was to compile an  anti-standards  file. And they had photographic evidence of me disrespecting children and not giving a shit about their learning. And drinking too much. And making up lessons as I go along. Or don't.
