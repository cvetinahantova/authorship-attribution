So I tried to send this once before--it's my letter to the editor of the  urlLink Walla Walla Union Bulletin .   I was responding to  urlLink this odious column by Kathleen Parker , who is one of those so-called "compassionate conservatives."        Since they don't publish letters to the editor on line, I'll copy it here ....       Kathleen Parker’s tirades against gay marriage are illogical and far too simplistic. Most recently (July 9, 2004), she asserts that gay marriage will harm children and that fathers should be particularly upset about this development.     She lumps together all men who have children into one group, ignoring for instance those gay men who have had children and want to be a parent to their children.     In fact, we all know people who turned out wonderfully even though they were raised in nontraditional ways, just as we all also know people who had terrible upbringings in traditional families.     Actually, Parker should realize that sex and gender roles do not necessarily overlap in neat stereotypical ways. There may be feminine men and masculine women. Children obviously their gender roles from a variety of sources, not just from some 1950s television sit com model.     Most importantly, it should be noted that in many states, including Washington, gay couples can already serve as foster parents and adopt children. By all accounts, they have done as good a job of parenting as anyone else. Why shouldn’t those couples be allowed to marry if they believe it is important to their children and families?       I got some nice responses from some people, and some noncommittal acknowledgement by others that they had seen my letter.     Earlier gay marriage observations:    urlLink HRC Ad   urlLink Lynn Cheney   urlLink Gay Marriage
