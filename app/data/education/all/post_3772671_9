This is a quite intelligent column about the difficulties facing German universities. I think you have to subscribe to  The Chronicle  in order to read the article, so I'll tell you briefly what some of his points are:  He is very critical of the reasoning behind the German drive to develop programs in bachelor's degrees. As he puts it, the Germans are turning to bachelor's degrees to save money, not to create the kind of coherent fundamental education that the best American programs offer.  He also scoffs at the idea that German alumni are going to start contributing wildly to their alma mater. They don't bond emotionally with their home institution and they don't have a tradition of public philanthropy.  He argues that German universities need to be able to develop their own specialities and areas of expertise, which means they need to be able to cut down on areas that aren't particularly good. Students also need to be able to choose where they want to go.   urlLink The Chronicle: 7/30/2004: Aspiring to Steeples of Excellence at German Universities
