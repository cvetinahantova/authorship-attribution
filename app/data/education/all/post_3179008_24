What a great weekend I had. I was able to get lots of house work done, and help out a friend moving. The weather was fantastic, and the break from the kids was very needed. I couldn't have expected that my three day weekend would be as rejuvenating as it was.   Sometimes transitions from a long break is difficlut for the kids and the staff, but it was much better than I had expected. Only one of our students had difficulty. She didn't even come into the classroom until after 11:00 a.m. She went into the kitchen and ate ice cream that was left over from a birthday celebration. We are hands off, so there wasn't much I could do. I did, however, not get into a power struggle.    Oh yeah, I did take a wonderful wlak in the park this weekend. I hope to do that again sometime soon.   Dave
