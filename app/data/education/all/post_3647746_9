Josh Marshall's got a  urlLink post  up today about news from Afghanistan concerning a mercenary of sorts who  "...was arrested with others for conducting a 'self-appointed counterterrorism mission that included abusing eight inmates in a private jail by hanging them by their feet.'"   Josh goes on to question what someone is doing operating a private jail, especially since it is very unclear who, if anyone, hired him.    His last paragraph reads:   It just seems like someone must have been paying this guy to do something, unless it's like a blog where you just set up shop and figure that someday a revenue stream might turn up.   Sure, I see the intended humor, but I find myself very uncomfortable with the comparison.    All in all, a disturbing story if you choose to follow the link to the ABCNEWS.com  urlLink page  it appears on.  Makes me think of all those movie moments when a CIA agent or Special Forces soldier is given an assignment, and when he is told that the mission is top secret, he responds,  "What mission, sir?"
