Now I remember what I like about summer... I really missed sleeping in.  Anyway, I got some good StarCraft in last night with Nate... eventually the game got so drawn out that we gave up due to boredom... it was pretty bad. I also did a lot of taxi missions yesterday on GTA3... that was cool.  Other than that, I really haven't done anything, but I'm going out today to do stuff.  Current Music: The Cranberries - Pretty
