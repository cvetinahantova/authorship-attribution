i woke up and my ankle hurt so i looked to see what happened and guess what? i got a monstrosity of a bug bite!  my mom said that it might be a spider bite. i remember a couple of years ago my brother got bite from a brown recluse and his bite started swelling. i hope that's not what this is because if it is, and i don't take care of it, it will rot away my leg. ok wow that was extremely random. i'm wierd like that, lol
