Due to the sudden influx of high school children in my life, both wanna-be writers and wanna-be lawyers (interesting sidenote--wanna-be writers infinitely more mature than wanna-be lawyers), time to post has been limited.  And the imagination hasn't been working properly either, which spells doom for a certain as-yet-unwritten novel.   Re the latter, I query you, my blog-reading friends: I'm curious to know, now that you're full-fledged denizens of the blogosphere--what blogs are you reading?  And why?  What is it that draws you to a blog in the first place, and what keeps you there?  Trust me when I say this is a more important question than it sounds, at least for me.   Here's the bonus: Paul Ingram, of Prairie Lights fame, has started a blog, so those of you no longer in Iowa who are still looking for recommendations need look no further.  Here's the link:  urlLink http://misternouse.blogspot.com .  Enjoy!
