urlLink Last Day of my LIfe  has inspired me again!  This time, straight into the depths of  urlLink Dante's Inferno :  The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to the Second Level of Hell!  Here is how you matched up against all the levels: Level           | Score Purgatory       | Very Low Level 1 - Limbo | Moderate  Level 2 | Very High  Level 3         | High Level 4         | Very Low Level 5         | Low Level 6 - The City of Dis | Very High Level 7         | High Level 8- the Malebolge | Moderate Level 9 - Cocytus | Low             urlLink Level descriptions       urlLink Take the test    Level 2 , the land of lust and depravity, it looks like I'll be spending eternity with Helen of Troy and Cleoptra!  And they call this " suffering "?  Why Level 2?  It seems I am overly fond of the opposite sex.  Even though I have never used deceit, drugs, or alcohol to seduce a woman, even though I have never seduced a woman just because she was good looking only to abandon her in the morning, and even though I have never cheated on my wife, I am still too perverse for the likes of heaven.  You know, somehow it doesn't bother me in the least!  To spend eternity surrounded by the likes of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy sounds like heaven to me!  With a hell like this, who needs salvation?
