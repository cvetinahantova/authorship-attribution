As many of you know, there is a pretend band waiting for me in Chicago, consisting of our own  urlLink Scott ,  urlLink Mike Loudmouth  from the once great, now defunct  urlLink Loudmouth Rockies (Caution, link is LOUD),  and Nice Guy Paul, probably best known for his modelling work but also  urlLink a photographer in his own right .  When I was in town last week the four of us grilled some meat and did what pretend bands do best:  we tried to come up with a name.  Two hour of hard thought yielded two possibilities acceptable to all of us:   urlLink Where Eagles   urlLink Daryl  and  urlLink Kuato .  (I am alone in preferring the former.  Something about paying tribute to a slimy psychic man-baby who lives on some dude's chest feels wrong.)  Since then I have come up with a few names I think are better:   Bristol City (Cockney rhyming slang...) The War Presidents The Stupid Club  And, a name that would be more punk rock, alas, than I am:  The Wife Killers (I just can't do it.  But if any troop of fuck the world 19 year olds want it, they can have it with my blessing.)   I'd like to acknowledge the inspiration I found for a few of these in  urlLink Schott's Miscellany ,an essential resource for any pretend band.
