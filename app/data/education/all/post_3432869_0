I woke up early this morning feeling restless, anxious, trapped.  I went to Fair Trade Coffee House and tried to shake it.  When Tony came by I was feeling a bit better, but incidently I ended up crying when I was telling him what was up.  A sure sign that the stress of it all was overflowing, literally.  He invited me to go with him and Smith to Devil's Lake.  It was just what I needed.    I know that the girls would never intentionally make me feel left out.  I wouldn't call such people my friends.  But that's why I felt like I needed to get away, to stop myself from feeling like there was anyone else to blame besides me.    Devil's Lake is definately one of the most beatiful places in Wisconsin.  The awe of God's creation smacked me in the face.  It woke me up from self defeating behaviors and screamed, "Open your eyes!"  Devil's Lake challenges me and pushes me to see the limits of my capabilities and the fragility of my existence.  One poorly placed foothold could cost me my life.   Yet when I come face to face with a 15' granite wall and the only way down is much worse, I find a way to overcome that challenge, whether it be by my own strength or by the hand of my best friend.
