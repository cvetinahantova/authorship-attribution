Hey guys! I just wanted to let you know that im back from the GAYEST camp i've ever gone to..usually i loove camp but cuz we went to a different one this year, it sucked a lot.  anyways! i read kevins thing about his "days events" nd i saw that he downloaded taking back sunday nd yellowcard music! i wanted to comment but for some reason it wouldnt let me..but the new Taking Back Sunday CD is WONDERFUL, its like the best cd i've ever sprung the money for! So i was pretty proud of kevin! nd i couldnt go to mcdonalds with you guys cuz i was with wendy nd the other cheerleaders nd i didnt want to be rude to them...maybe next time, right?!  anyways so this was basically just to say that im back nd if you guys are planning anything call or email me!
