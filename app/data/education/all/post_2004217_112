urlLink     My glorious new welly, that I painstakingly customised using only nail varnish. They need to make bigger brushes for that sort of thing...  urlLink        Wow! My guide leader just texted me! Very impressive. My dad can barely grasp the concept of predicted text, let alone the punctuation key- he texted me recently to tell me he was going to see Harry Routes at the cinema, which, if you translate it correctly, actually means Harry Potter.     I think I've become addicted to e-bay. I went on last night to see if I could buy some  denim   dungarees  (I lost out in the last minute when some bastard swooped in and bid about 20p more than me, just as my mouse packed in and 203493004 popups appeared), and have now bid on 2 limited edition Less Than Jake stickers (currently winning), a  bright red tutu  (also currently winning) and a limited edition New Found Glory sticker. I sort of cheated on the NFG sticker though, I didn't bother to bid and just clicked the " Buy It   Now! " link. Should be here in about 2 days! Hooray. I'm currently perusing shoes, and have found a pair of gorge   pale blue Ugg boots   for £15. Mmmmm wantwantwant.     I've also, as you can see, been putting my  creative skills  to work again with my new   wellies  , which I plan to take to camp and Leeds. I bought them for a bargainous £10 from a work clothes place in Worcester ("Jobtogs"- how great is that name??), so they're made of pretty sturdy stuff, especially the toes, which are steel-capped. Great for moshing, as I can inflict pain without receiving it myself! Score. Perhaps owning a pair of boots such as these will qualify me adequately to work on a building site... Oddly enough, images of the second series of  Dirty Sanchez  spring to mind. Eek.      Ceff  (using new Blogger tools successfully!)  x       But who cares? No big deal... I want more...
