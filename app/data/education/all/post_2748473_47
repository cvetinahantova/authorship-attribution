So far it's looking like it is gonna be a great summer. I am gonna go on a missions trip this summer helping the Latino peoples, which will be a unique experience. I love you all very much.   Going Through The Motions   Only you can start this fire in my heart, set me a blaze tonite Cold no longer One day my fight will be over, but for now I'm looking straight ahead And its all for you So i'll let you rise, i'll let you rise in these bones Our eyes have grown dim finding no rest in ourselves Renew us o' lord, light the fire within Burn, renew this heart Burn, and rise from these ashes Burn the fire within Burn rise up from these ashes Burn, and cleanse these bones Burn, renew my heart cause i'll praise you Burn until the day that you will return Nothing more than to see through your eyes I want nothing else but to see through your eyes Burn in my heart Take my heart, set me free, light my fire   Beloved has gotten pretty big, which is kind of odd that they are from K-Vegas. They have always had it though.
