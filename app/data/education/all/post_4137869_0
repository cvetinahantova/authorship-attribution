Dear Journal,             Well, to catch up for you:  I met Jeremy 3/15 at Zone 154, and I called and talked to him 3/17.  I think I took his comments a little too seriously and the wrong way.  Well, I’ve been thinking about the conversations I had with Mama and Kim, and then with Jennifer about Jeremy.  I’ve been thinking maybe he really wants to hook up; otherwise why would he be bugging Brian to call Kim/Jennifer to give me his number??  So anyway, I called him 8:30 tonight.  We talked about 30 minutes.  We cleared the air about the misunderstandings, and we talked about all kinds of things.  I told him I wouldn’t mind if we could hook up this weekend.  He said he would like to.  Before I even called him, I’ve been thinking of asking Mama and Kim if I can go to Kim’s this weekend.  We’ll see...             When Jeremy and I were saying our goodbyes, he says, “Bye baby doll.”  That’s so kute!  I told him I’d try to call him tomorrow night.  I wonder if I can mange to get a calling card free off the web, like I used to do.
