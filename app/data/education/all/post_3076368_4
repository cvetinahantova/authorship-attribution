That's me impersonating a dial-up network dialing up.  I hate dial-up, especially since we had DSL at home.  Dial-up networkers and dentists will go to the same level of hell.  I'm not sure what level they'll be on, since neither were invented when Dante wrote...maybe they'll be in there witn the traitors against mankind.  Wherever they are, though, they'll be there.  The dentists will have their teeth perpetually drilled without novocaine (or maybe they'll alternate no novocaine with making them so numb they can't move their heads...).  The dial-up people will have to try to load an infinitely large website on their computers connected by...yeah, you guessed it...a dial-up network.  The more I read in this, the more I think that I shouldn't post when I'm tired.  Really.  Look at me stopping.  I got to see Sellis and Matthew today...I don't know why that makes me so excited, but it does.  For some reason, I really wanted to see them, and I got to today and I get to tomorrow.  How lucky can one girl be??!!?!  Oh yeah, and Jess and Adam had their baby.  Brigid Elizabeth (Snell).  BEE_YOOUU_TEEEE_FUUULLLL  (I first wrote "_FUUUKKKK," which I think is funny).  What a doll.
