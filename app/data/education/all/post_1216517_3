i've worked 3 days so far.  cool.  it's extremely laidback in there.  it's a 9-man staff and i'm number 9 in the  urlLink avpress  sports dept power rankings.  that's cool though.   Friday I have my first writing assignment.  word.  i want to go to thailand.  i read  urlLink the beach   and it made me want to globe hop again.  i miss europe.  southeast asia is next on my list.  i still have the travelling bug.  probably always will.  i'm hungry.  i want a pizza.  we just rented a baseball video game.  so we're occupied for a while.  i'm thinking about moving up to the "av".  that's antelope valley for those of you not in the know.  it's about an hour and a half drive each way.  i can almost deal with that.  There's no traffic really, but its an 80 mile trip each way and considering that  urlLink gas  is $2.15 a gallon at best, it's about $15 bucks a day.  boo.  rained hard yesterday.  my car was hyro-planeing it on the 5.  woo hoo.  elliot smith soothed my soul during the commute.  as did the wonderful  urlLink bob dylan , who's music is currently featured in a victoria secret commercial.  funny.  i'm hungry.    urlLink tigers  will be 2003 world series champs.
