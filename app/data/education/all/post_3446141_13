I don't like my job for reasons like today.  Everything was great I was movin along getting all my shit done and then I get hit with some other project that I'm suppose to get finished by the end of the day on a Friday no less!  I was told about it sort of.....but I was told that I would be making ONE that is 1 gift basket with some gourmet coffees.  Ok that's cool I can do that.  But no come to find out that isn't what I'm doing.  I had to make up some random gift baskets for freakin George Foremen....No Kidding....the one and only George, who has like 50 billion kids named George as well.  That one. Didn't meet Georgey just the middleman.  But I had to put together baskets with coffee mugs/thermos, coffees, BBQ sauce, marinade, and other meat seasonings............oh um WTF, that stuff doesn't go together.  But whatever.  And they wanted not ONE not TWO, but THREE baskets.  And by the way they brought the shit to me at like 2:30 and were like can you have them done today??  What the hell?!?  So that put me in a shittyass mood. But I got it done by 4 because I am fucking amazing.  LOL.  Anyho.  The guy came back to "look them over" he didn't have a lot of faith in me I don't think.  But he freakin loved the baskets I made.  It was kinda funny, and it helped my mood.  So I am feeling better now, than I was when I started.  And very glad that I will not be at work till 7:00 on a Friday.  BLAH and next week is a training week, oh yes, I can't freakin wait!!!!  Sarcasm is my friend. Later gaters!  Everyone have an awesome weekend!! Call me if anything fun is goin on!  Or if you are too drunk to drive home to C-town and need a place to crash in LR. LOL
