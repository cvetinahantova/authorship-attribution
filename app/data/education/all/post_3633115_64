I have an entire house to finish cleaning and 30 minutes to do it in.  SHIT.  I usually don't have a problem, but I was cleaning up my computer table and bumped the keyboard drawer which moved the mouse which woke up my monitor which was calling me to get online.    I love run-on sentences.  So now, here I am checking out my blog and others and trying to get my ass away from the conmputer so I can vacuum before I pick up Shorty from daycare and get ready to leave for our family vacation to the gulf coast and the Houston area.  Yay.  I love four hour drives with a three year old.  Thank Goodness for our travel DVD player!   UPDATE:  While I didn't get everything done, I did get almost everything done.  I won't be totally embarrassed for my friend to come to the house while I'm gone.  Now I just need to go hide the porn. ;)
