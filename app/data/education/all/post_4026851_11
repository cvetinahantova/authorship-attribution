Two months gone already, and my total summer accomplishments equal: bupkus.  What happened to, "I wanted a job in education not only to  educate , but to use those three months of freedom each year to launch a successful (and immensely profitable) writing career?"  Granted, in the past eight weeks I've logged a few thousand words on MSN messenger and more still on various retoolings of a still-fruitless Match.com profile... but that wasn't what I had in mind on career day.    My screen name is Krypto, and this is how I'm wasting my summer vacation.  Or rather, this is an attempt to write things, which is not a waste, about how I waste time when I'm not writing.  About the wasting.  Of time.
