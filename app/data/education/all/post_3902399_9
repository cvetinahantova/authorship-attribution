Go to the following link and take the Kiersey  Temperament Sorter. This site will ask for your name and  email-- feel free to make up all/both.    urlLink http://www.advisorteam.com/temperament_sorter/register.asp?partid=    After you've taken the sorter, tell us how you've been  identified, whether or not you agree with the  designation, and examples from your life that prove or  disprove the designation.   Companies spend a lot of time and money on these sorts  of tools. Do you think they are worthwhile?
