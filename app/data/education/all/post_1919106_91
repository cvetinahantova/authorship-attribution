Time to relax a bit. But not too long   Yay! I finished all my classes. And I found out from the consulate that I can file the study permit application in person, in which case they might actually get it done in a day or two. I've spent the last two days relaxing. I can't start to tell how stressed out I was. Remember that nasty,  naasty  cough I had? It's gone! Poof. Vanished. Kapput. Auf wiedersehn.  Gone .  I can only regret that I have to leave in a week. On the one hand, I don't mind leaving this cesspool of political bile. But on the other hand, my best friends are here... I will miss them  a lot . The majority of my good memories during my stay here are related to them. I can confidently say that I've become attached to them. I will be lonely up in Canadia without me friends... I guess I'll have to work hard to find new ones, but I definitively want to stay in touch with the current ones.
