One of the things that I love about Sheffield is its proximity to the Peak district.  It feels quite unusual to be in a city and yet after 20 minutes drive to be in the middle of moorland.   Spent an afternoon in the (partial) wilderness yesterday and felt much better for it.  Wind, hot air balloons, highland cattle, cliffs.  Just what I needed.  Now that the wild is accessible in a few minutes where are our limits?  On a related theme of travel and connectedness, Got a letter from the parents of Rex, whom we sponsor, he'd drawn a picture for us to.  So cool to think that my money, thoughts and prayers are having an impact on someone's life so far away.  SO often its the other way round, my clothes are made in a sweatshop or the oil in my car is from who knows where.  Heartily recommend  urlLink sponsoring .  Feeling bit rough this morning.  hope it goes.  Had a fight, a child being sick and a girl crying in my classes on Friday.  My first hat-trick!
