urlLink ERIC Digests  I know I blogged the ERIC lesson plan site the other day.  However, I thought I would point out the ERIC Digest site.  This page has links to several thousand ERIC Digests dating back to the early 80s.  There is a search box that allows the user to search it all without needing to conduct any tedious browsing.  A search on information literacy returns dozens of results.  Some of the hits are recent.  Some are old.  All of them have interesting content (with definitions, program descriptions, literature reviews) and are worth wading through.  ERIC Digest are in the public domain.  From the Eric site, "ERIC Digests are in the public domain and may be freely reproduced and disseminated, but please acknowledge your source."  You can freely share the information you find in print, e-mail, or web form.  I have taken several of these digests and reproduced them full-text at  urlLink LibraryInstruction.Com .  In addition to information literacy, try searching for library instruction, libraries, library education, library, and librarians as these terms also reveal some good content.
