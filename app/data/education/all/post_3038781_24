Got Mercury?   Well, the EPA's top officials don't seem to care if you do. Take a look at this mercury  urlLink letter . It's sort of sickening. With all the known effects and the EPA's own reports warn:    " urlLink When [Mercury] is vaporized and inhaled, it can be very, very toxic. Initial symptoms include a cough, breathing difficulties, and chest pain. Vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and nerve or kidney problems may develop later "(http://www.epa.gov/seahome/mercury/src/florida1.htm).  " urlLink Patients... [suffer]...numbness of the limbs and the area around the mouth, sensory disturbance, and difficulty with hand movements (such as grasping things, fastening buttons, holding chopsticks, writing, etc.); also, there was lack of coordination, weakness and tremor, slowed and slurred speech, and ataxic gait, followed by disturbances of vision, and hearing. These symptoms became aggravated and led to general paralysis, deformity of the limbs, difficulty in swallowing, convulsions, and death " (http://www.epa.gov/seahome/mercury/src/minamata.htm).  I hope more people start getting ticked off about this... If more people don't, who knows what the EPA will think up next.
