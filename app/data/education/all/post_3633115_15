Okay, so the curtains FINALLY got hung.  It took me forever because the cheapy little rods I bought, came with equally cheapy wall attachments.  I just gave up and busted out with the drill and electric screwdriver (mmm....screwdriver, could so go for one of those right now) and some screws and made those damn things stay in the wall.  Shorty now has curtains in his room and a brand new lovie blankie that he desperately needed.  The old one was really starting to look it and so S and I took him to the store to pick out new fabric for his new blankie.  If I never sew again it will be too damned soon.  But, jeez do I feel accomplished!
