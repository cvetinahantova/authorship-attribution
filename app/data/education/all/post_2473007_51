There is a thief in my living room, and he is entertaining me.  Pouring out his theoretic heart, baring his nonexistent soul, yet never passing up a joke or an exciting comment - he's been there for me through it all.  Despite loss or pain, his words always cover my woes and captivates my attention.  Every day he kills me and I smile.  I never have to wonder if he will speak with me, because his pleasantries are unending.  He does not hear me; still he knows my feelings and desires and tells me that I am not alone in this world.  So I blindly give up my life, my friendships, and my talents for him, because it is much easier to hear life spoken of than to actually live.
