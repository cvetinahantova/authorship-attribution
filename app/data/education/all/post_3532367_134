I managed to speak to Anglea yesterday. We were both disappointed at not being able to meet up this week, but it was great to be able to hear her voice again. She sounds like she is having a great time with the friendly locals - hehe! It helped me get through the day at work too. Every time I felt as though I was slipping, I would just think of this sweet accent.  It was the MIL's birthday as well, so I popped in to say hello and to see the kids. They were really great - had loads of hugs and I even stayed for tea. Sandra left early to go to her fitness class, so I was able to eat my chinese in peace. By the time I had finished it was time to go down the gym and work up a sweat, although it didn't help me sleep any better!
