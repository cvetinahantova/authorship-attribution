It's coming down to the wire!  I can't believe three weeks have gone by since my last "blog."  So much has happened.  I went to Madison last weekend.  Friday night, the girls had a fondue party and we all sat around just talking and enjoying one cheese and one chocolate fondue with all the fixings.  Saturday, Camila, Suji and I strolled along Maxwell Street Days on State Street.  Later that evening, Stu and Alan threw Tony and I a going away party at their new place.  The apartment is nice, but what makes it "choice" is the enormous patio that extends off the living room.  The building/apartment is so new that it isn't really finished, including a few major details like a railing on part of the patio.  It's only a 4 story plunge to your death on the concrete steps of the apartment!  We grilled out and just hung out on the deck.  Their neighbor has the cutest puppy!!!  It happens to be named Cooper and looks just like him too.  It was unbelievable.  I felt like it was our Cooper's spirit saying good bye.  Apparently, there were a few mishaps that evening.  One involved the neighbor with the cute dog getting water dumped on her.  The other involved the beautifully new apartment getting trashed sometime after we left.  I  would have been livid, but apparently, Stu wasn't that upset.       Andrea, Suji, Camila, Hassan and I finished off Saturday evening by going to "Flashbacks" at the Marriott hotel on the west side.  Although I really enjoyed being there with the girls, I would have felt better if Tony were there.  I don't mean to sound snobby, but I felt really trashy just by being there.  There were a lot of dirty old men sitting around the dance floor just smoking and drinking.  I didn't like the way they were looking at us.  I also cannot forget to mention "Mullet Man", who hit on Camila over a half a dozen times.  You'd think that he'd get the hint after 5 or six blow offs.  Duh!?!  The human bowling pins on the dance floor were rather entertaining.  Especially because I knew one of them because she works at the Oregon AnchorBank.  They were so wasted, they kept falling over one another on the dance floor.  The other girl also kept grabbing Hassan on the dance floor.  There was the bride who after her reception made her way to Flashbacks and was dancing on the bar while her new husband slapped her ass.  And finally, there was an extremely overweight woman in tight white capri pants, white socks and tennis shoes who was doing synchronized pelvic thrusts with a skinny old guy.  It was about all I could take.  Strangely enough, I wouldn't have spent the evening any other way.  It was great just being with the girls.  And just look at all the great memories we have of that night!  We topped off the evening by spliting up the magnets that I made over the year.            I moved out of 304 N. Carroll St. #2 on Sunday.  I got an early start.  Camila helped me with a few last things and she made Tony and I pancakes and fresh fruit!  It was a day of painful good-byes.  I had to say good bye to the girls who will most likely be my last roommates.  How do you say good bye to people who you feel are such a big part of you?  I guess when the tears dry and the hugs have been given, you are left with the joy and warmth of having them in your heart, always.  With friends like these, you don't ever really leave them because they live forever in your heart.       Tony's parents came down to pick up the last of his things.  They took us out to Q-doba and we said our good byes.  It was really hard.  I have enjoyed getting to know Tammy, Bob and their families.  It is such a blessing to have such wonderful people in my life.       Then I had to leave Tony in a somewhat displaced situation, not living at 207 W. Gorham and without a key to Stu's apartment.  It was hard knowing that this next week would be filled with so many changes of which he wouldn't be a part.  I hope I never have to maintain a relationship via telephone for an extended amount of time.  The next time I'll see him will most likely be in Tokyo, a half a world away.  However, knowing that he is on the other end of this exciting adventure to Japan makes it even more exciting.  I can't wait to see him again.  This year has so much in store for us and I'm so glad that Tony is the one I get to share it with.  I wouldn't want it any other way.     I made it home Sunday night just in time for the family get together in our backyard.  I love being in our backyard.  Dad has done such a nice job with the landscaping, flowers, and fire pit.  Grandma, Rudy, Russ and Mary, Rose, Drew, Jess and Nate all joined us for dinner on the picnic table and a campfire.  Simple times with loved ones.  "These are a few of the things, I love the most in my life."       I've been packing, re-packing and picking up little things here and there all week.  Packing is definately a science.  2 bags and a carry on seem so little to be taking for a year but I have to keep in mind that anything I don't have and need can be shipped or purchased.
