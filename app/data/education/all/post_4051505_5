i'm sitting here, completely bored, NOTHING to do. i want to know why my life is so boring. well, today is particularly boring cos i haven't been out all day and i'm just stuck in this stupid house with nothing to do and no humans to talk to except my parents...but they don't count cos my mum's glued to the computer, trying to fix some error thingy, and my dad's...somewhere...(not sure...havent seen him in a while...) it's dark, it's grey...it's britain in july...and i am soooo bored i think i just might curl up and die. advantages of curling up and dying: -the boredom will stop -i find out what happens after death -i get missed by a few people -i get on the local news (?) -people will remember me as the girl who died of boredom -i'll be kinda famous -i don't have to eat, sleep or bother doing anything disadvantages of curling up and dying: -i die (obvious, yet important) -people miss me (hopefully) -no more life...bye bye life, boring or not -i'll never get older -i'll never do what i want to do in my life -never get married -never have kids i've decided i won't die just yet. but i'm warning you people, if i get any more bored than i am now it's over. i will sit in a corner and die, with a note in my hand saying 'im bored'. grr. i'm so bored! if boredom was a physical action, it would be hitting your head against a brick wall over and over until you die
