. housekeeping .  i've been cleaning out my office, scrubbing under my kitchen sink and now i've fooled a bit with the links bar over yonder...  went back to my old format of including some recommendations along with the blogs of friends and family.    i've decided *not* to include student blogs -- an arbitrary "line" demarcating where my confusing "front burner" and "back burner" leave off from one another.  Some of you will recognize that former students who have now been promoted to official "friend" status have been retained.    Been having wierd dreams where my college friends go on trips with me and my students and my family members morph into old acquaintances.  they feel like a metaphor for the contents of the FIVE trashcans i filled with paper two days ago (and i'm only half way done!) -- an amalgam of all material evidence for the fragmented and profound experiences that have constituted the "me" many of you know...  peace~
