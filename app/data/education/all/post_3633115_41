So I get in the car this morning to drive Shorty to daycare.  As I pull out of the driveway and onto the street I realize that I can hear the street sounds a bit louder than I should.  It turns out that the passenger side front door had not been closed all the way.  No sooner do I realize this, than the door comes flying all the way open (I live on the top of a hill) and S's toolbox goes flying out of the car. (He was working on installing my new radio...which stopped working upon installation. Great.)   *says under breath* sassafrassashsihihasofieohohaodtihafa   Me:Dangit S!  You need to check and be sure all the doors are shut.  Geez I could so hurt you. *hits the brakes, gets out of the car gets the toolbox and makes sure they are all still inside. tosses them into the car, slams the door, gets back in the car.*   Shorty says: What happened Mommy, you scared me.  *Shit*   Me: Sorry honey, the door came open and daddy's tools came out of the car. I got angry for a moment I'm sorry sweetie.   Shorty: Are you going to hurt daddy?   Me: *crap* No sweetie, Mommy was just really mad for a minute and I said something I didn't really mean.  I'm very sorry for making you worry, I was just angry.  Don't worry, Mommy will never hurt Daddy.   Shorty: That was scary huh Mom?   Me: Yes Sweetie, but its all over now.   The End.
