It has been a while. I had a break for a week. Loved it. Now I am back doing a Day Treatment component of our school. We do a lot of social skills building and recreational challenges. Today we took the kids out on a lake to canoe. Wow, what a challenge for the staff and kids. We have quite a few kids with us for this part that we the staff don't know. That is not cool. Some of them are just being "baby sat " by us. We are not being monetarily compensated for the services provided. We are doing favors for foster parents, providing respit. Whatever, I am feeling good about having had vacation, and the possibility of having a new position next year.  Maybe salary, and a raise. I do know that I will be in a different class next year, with the older kids. Right on!  Peace Out, D
