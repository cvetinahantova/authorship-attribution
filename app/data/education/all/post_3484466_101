I'm lovin' this fan controller... I don't know if I mentioned before, but I have to use two power supplies to run the fan controller, because I was short one power plug. I was thinking about getting a little converter to go from floppy to normal peripheral so I can plug it in there. That would be convenient, since I don't have a floppy drive anyway, and I don't plan to.  Current Music: Foo Fighters - Low
