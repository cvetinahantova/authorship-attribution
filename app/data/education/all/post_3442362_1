School's out for the summer.   Emilie burst through the front door Wednesday, which was the official last day in Cy Fair, and proclaimed "this is the best day of my life!"  Ah, be still my heart.  This exclamation comes close only to her first "i love you" when she was 2.  Yeah, my little girl is so happy.   4th grade was an emotional roller coaster akin to the Texas Cyclone.  Every day it was a dispute with another friend.  One day Rachel is her very best friend.  The next day Rachel hates her.  One day Jackie is a snob.  The next day they're on some new level.  (they have this elaborate way to rank their friendships-"well,now we're one step above acquaintances, MOMmy!  We're not enemies any more")  I swear some days I dreaded coming home.  How am I supposed to stay neutral in all this?  I mean, I will admit that my own child can be a little on the mean side.  I doubt that she's little miss innocent cast to the sidelines of 4th grade without provocation.  Still, they made fun of her acne.  Ooooh...don't go there with me little missy.  And called her a geek?    Anyway, apparently things were sorted out on the last day and everyone is right as rain again.   AND, Emiie got 100 percent on her math TAKS and only missed one question in writing and one in reading, earning her the honor of commended performance.  She's extremely proud of herself (rightly so).  She sorta slipped in the report card with an overall average of 89.  She had to kiss the $50 bucks good bye.  I gotta think of a better incentive for next year.  Ideas anyone?  Maybe we should just ground her when she comes home without all A's at the 6 weeks like Jessica's parents do.  hmmm
