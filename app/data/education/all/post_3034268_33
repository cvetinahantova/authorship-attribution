carelessness   For some reason, perhaps my recent fascination with strife, I have been a bit too careless with comments and actions that I have made.  For example, I currently give tours to prospective students at BSU as a part of my job.  As I was bringing a fairly large group of students through the Lower Union Food Court, I noticed that one of the top food service managers was sitting directly behind me, and listening to my tour.  I always talk about food services at this spot, and when I talked about the walnut Hall cafeteria, I made it very clear, in a loud voice, that our cafeteria food sucked, which I don't even believe.  Hell, I don't even eat in the cafeteria.  Of course, the manager contacted my boss, and I had to deal with it when I got back to the office.    Actually, this incident isn't too bad; the only individual that was put into an uncomfortable position was myself.  But it is a specific example of the type of things I have done.  There have been a few other things said by me that  may  make the lives of my friends more uncomfortable.  There were no lies told, but perhaps some things that were implicitly known to be private were, while not disclosed, at least pointed to  (If this is too vague, then it probably doesn't apply to you).  In my opinion, that's not expressing loyalty and respect towards my friends.  I won't repeat what was said or done here, as it would only perpetuate the problem.  I need to have more control over when to keep my mouth shut (for talking as well as another thing).
