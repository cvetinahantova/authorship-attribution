Wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend You could cut ties with all the lies you've been living in And if you do not want to see me again I would understand I would understand   Monday morning. ::rolls eyes::   In theatre arts our warm-up was a trust one where someone is picked up by seven or so people and them spun around at waist level. Everyone was like, "Oh, I'm too fat," or "I weigh to much!" Which was really stupid because two of the girls were sticks and the other three weren't fat or anything. Maybe bigger than me, but not fat or anything. I was just like, "This is stupid, let's just go!" and then after they were done they were all happy and thought it was really cool. It was cool. I felt light as a feather.  In Spanish I have a 99.5, which really surprised me since last semester with Mrs. Beall I barely had a 90. An A is good in the first place, but I've got basically a 100. I guess Ms. Sharrer is just way more fun and child-like at heart.  Math has turned into gibberish with its polynomials. Looks like a baby smashed his hands on a keyboard and they printed it onto a math worksheet. Somehow I've been getting by with a 90 on the last test and worksheets and whatnot. I despise math, but I'm not bad at it or anything.   Hahaha! In Biology we studied the reproductive ways of our own chosen animal. Jenny chose a Jackrabbit, and she learned that their gestation period (length of pregnancy) is only 41-47 days. Sarah is researching Sea Otters and she learned that they mate and have their babies in the water. I'm researching mongeese and all I learned was that Rikki Tikki Tavi from Rudyard Kipling was a mongoose and that they are banned from Canada and the U.S. Yes, I have my priorities straight, don't I? :-)  Ran four miles for my work out today, and a mile for warm up and a mile for cool down. Six miles isn't too bad, but not as much as I usually do. It was all at a 6:30 pace. I was tired as anything when I was done though.
