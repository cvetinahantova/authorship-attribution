The May Rain    i bid thee a true farewell for thine everlasting beauty o' april, thou sure'st have dampen and grace my soul weathering down the pollens and it's thy speciality by borrowing thyself to hail thee as a spring'st whole i earnestly offer thee my sincere salutation, o' may thou sprinkle'st the eternal tears on me, oh so profound that honeyed droplets shall never cease the new day yet thou art forever young, so must thy be crowned i extend my flame for thee and should'st it sweeten the fruits of beloved mother nature for her devotedness oh me dear'st and know'st thine ever passion to strengthen the fragile spirit of mine and i thank thee for thy fondness please bequeath me the power of water that will'st last long thou art the steadfast goddess, so beautiful and strong   @William-Kalani Chevy Kekua  May 2nd, 2004
