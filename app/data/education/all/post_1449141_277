FREE CARNIVAL AREA OF THE AMERICAS -------------------------------- Six weeks of street theatre & tall puppetry building; Five days of festive, puppet-filled marching; Three days of uplifting anti-corporate protesting; ONE MILE FROM THE BEACH IN SUNNY SOUTH EAST FLORIDA!  *This November, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) Ministerial is holding closed conversations on community collapse, and conspiring for consecration of corporate conglomeration, in Miami, Florida, November 19th - 21st, 2003.  *This Fall, the Free Circus Area of the Americas (FCAA) is holding public production of props and puppets, and prodigiously promoting people power, in Palm Beach County, Florida (60 miles north of Miami), October 1st - November 14th, 2003.  *On November 15th, six weeks' worth of creativity will be paraded, marched, stilted, wheeled, carried, and dragged on a 60-mile romp to Miami, joining in with the November 20th 'Day of Action' festivities.  ----> YOU ARE INVITED!!!  The Lake Worth Global Justice Group will open a warehouse October 1st in Palm Beach County, Florida, 60 miles north of Miami. The purpose? To bring together community groups in South Florida by building props, puppets, bikes,  things that flutter delicately in the wind, mobile stages and whatever else you  can imagine. This is a call out to socially conscious artists and art collectives to travel here and collaborate with us. Maybe you or a group you are  working with already have ideas and need a space to make them come to life? GREAT!!! Contact us and let's talk. Or maybe you want to get involved but don't  have a project in mind? GRAND!!! There are plenty of projects to plug into and  all sorts of ways help out!  ----> Who Is The Free Circus Area Of The Americas?  BIKE BUILDERS, PUPPETEERS, WELDERS, GARDENERS, FIRE EATERS, MURALISTS, MUSICIANS, PAINTERS, THING-FINDERS, COOKS, DANCERS, CARPENTERS, PEOPLE WITH ONE  PINK SOCK, STORY TELLERS, FILMMAKERS, RADICAL CHEERLEADERS, KID CARERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, KITE FLYERS, COSTUME CREATORS, FOLKS THAT LOVE SEWING & (Especially) YOU!  ----> What This Might Look Like:  A warehouse open everyday - stocked with paint, tools, glue, parts, passion, and  piles of spectacularly second-hand material - to create giant puppets, elaborate  costumes, noise-making devices, street theater skits, colorful banners, and really big hula-hoops. A place with outdoor makeshift gardens, an area just for  bicycle building (traditional and not), and a colorful story-board on the rise  (and fall!) of N.A.F.T.A., C.A.F.T.A, & F.T.A.A. A space for meetings and events such as ice cream mango socials, F.T.A.A teach-ins, hip-hop shows,  movie nights, gorilla theatre, and (of course!) public puppet performance pandemonium. A temporary radical community center bringing art, activism, and  local folks together.  ----> The Fine Print  We are a small bunch here in Lake Worth but we would like to help house you, feed you, and get you a bike, if you are interested in participating. We  love kids, so if you are a parent, bring the tykes along, too. Palm Beach County  is warm and toasty in November, with avocados and citrus as far as the eye can  see.   ----> Get In Touch ASAP  Lake Worth Global Justice Group: (561) 547-6686 or sfglobaljustice@yahoo.com F.T.A.A and the counter-mobilizations: www.stopftaa.org  or www.ftaaresistance.org.
