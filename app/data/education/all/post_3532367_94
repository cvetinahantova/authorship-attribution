"I am not strong enough to do anything about it and I dont think you are either, so it looks like we are going to be unhappy for the rest of our lives." Said Sandra. She continued "Yes I have been like it since we got married. I begged to have you back (we split on the run up to our wedding), I got pregnant (during the making up process) and I agreed to things I didn't want just to keep you. I have done ever since....we have never been a happy house".  She is not strong enough for Relate or to see the doctor as she doesn't want to humiliate herself again. "It's too soon, why can't we just sort out the money side first?" She said. "I don't want the pain agiain, it's not something I am brave enough to do like you."
