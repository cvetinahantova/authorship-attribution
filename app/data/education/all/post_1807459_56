So looks like I really did misspell Daegu.  But at least I went back and corrected it.  I might have tomorrow off.  I really hope I do.  That would work out great b/c then I'd have three days in a row off.  I don't know what I'll do but I'm sure I'll figure something out.  My abs hurt from where Meabh and Alex were hitting me on Saturday night.  I think I might be in for tuna sandwich making today.  Oh joy.  For some reason the owners of my academy think that making a tuna sandwich is the perfect way to celebrate Christmas.  It must be a Korean thing.   I want to take a trip out of the country.  I think I'll try and do that in January.  Last year we went to China for Chinese New Year.  You think that China would be the place to be for a holiday named "Chinese New Year".  Not really, it was dead, really dead.  But we'll see.  This is about the longest I've ever been in Korea continuously.  It really isn't so bad I guess.  I just wish I had a better variety of food to eat.   Seems there is a lot of drama going on lately on all fronts.  I guess this is the holiday season and that is too be expected.  I just hope everyone is happy.  Doesn't feel like Christmas in Korea does it?  Last year we had a white Christmas, maybe we'll be lucky again this year.  If I hear that fucking Wham "last Christmas" song again I might kill someone.
