I am exhausted.  Ex-haust-ed.  Which led me to this...   Ah, the good ol' days...  Remember in the days before cable TV and VCRs (can you remember that far back? I can).  We only had like 5 or 6 channels so if you wanted to watch TV, you watched what was on.  Because of this, I remember watching a large number of cheezy movies.  One of the cheeziest (yes, it's a word--I'm a teacher, I know these things) was  urlLink "The Girl, the Gold Watch, and Everything".   For those of you who don't remember the days before cable TV and VCRs and were fortunate enough to have a T-ball game on the night this aired, it's about a guy who inherits a gold pocket watch that has the amazing ability to stop time.  I'm so tired this week that I've had fantasies about aquiring that watch.  I'd stop time (for everyone else--not me) and spend a good straight 16 hours sleeping.  Is it sad how much of my life is influenced by bad TV?
