Given my post yesterday, this email update from Nicole Poston, a woman in my church, (who is studying spanish in Honduras) caught my attention.  She's talking about her teacher:    He teaches me Honderenismos like the phrase you say when you are about to sneeze and then you don’t. De lo arrenpentidos esta lleno el Reino de los Ceilos. The Kingdom of Heaven is full of repenters already.  The idea is that when you sneeze you are repenting,  so when you don’t sneeze people say this to mean, don’t worry too much, there are enough repenters already there.   sneezing / repenting?
