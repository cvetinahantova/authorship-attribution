This months copy of  urlLink New Internationalist  came through my door today.  It is entitled "In the name of God:  The uses and abuses of religion."  It includes sobering articles on the relationship between religion and violence and the inspiring story of Social Justice worked out by Catholic Bishops in Brazil. There's also a very interesting article by David Boulton who asks,  "Who needs religion?"  I kinda like his concluding paragraph...   "Enabling dreams of Paradise, a world where swords will be beaten into ploughshares, a counter-reality which glimpses and alternative republic of heaven on earth, where peace is built on justice rather than conquest ... this, not virgin births, second comings, holy wars and infallible books, is the real stuff: hard-core religion in action.  And we have a basic need for that, even if we know the need can never be wholly satisfied, the itch never healed."   While I might disagree about some of the doctrine stuff I find the this an incredibly challenging reminder of the mission of Christ.
