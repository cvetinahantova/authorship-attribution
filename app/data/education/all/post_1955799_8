Working on novel again.  I got an idea for the title.  Came up  with the idea while walking to my car from class.  Jotted it down on a peice of paper.    I'll post the title one day.  LOL.  Not to be mysterious, but its not copywrited, so I don't want to give it away without protection.  As soon as I get it together, I'll be proud to show it.    Took Photshop class today.  Got a little confused, but I think I'll todays lesson is under control.
