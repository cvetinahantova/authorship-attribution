urlLink Using Critical Thinking To Conduct Effective Searches of Online Resources.    This essay is by Sarah K. Brem and Andrea J. Boyes. As the title suggests, it looks at ways teachers and librarians can help students learn to use their critical thinking skills to find information online.  From the essay:  More than 80 percent of academic, public and school libraries offer some form of Internet access (American Library Association, 2000); thousands of full-text electronic journals and serials are available online. However, most searches of these materials are cursory and ineffective(Hertzberg & Rudner, 1999). This Digest complements guidelines addressing the mechanics of online searching by considering how treating information searches as exercises in critical thinking can improve our use of online resources. It addresses the use and application of metacognition, hypothesis testing, and argumentation.
