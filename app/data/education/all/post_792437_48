Most Frustrating!    Â  I'm so mad today, uggh it' annoying me. Thursdays are my good days. I get done with the class I attend very early, then after an hour break I teach for two hours. After that I'm free fo the rest of the day to do research. So...knowing all this, I set up some bacteria to use for my research. I set it up yesterday, only today I came in to do research, and it didn't even grow. I am soo mad! I feel as if I could have spent all this time doing something worthwhile but now I sit here writing this! Acck, I'll do homework now...borrrinnnng...
