email i got earlier from someone my parents' age: "Lara, Just read your latest email...what a life you live, you go girl!  Wish I had done more of those fun things when I was your age."  question (which i have asked before): do i really lead that exciting a life, or is that just the theme of my generation and the people who tell me such things don't know enough 20-somethings =P?  discuss.  in other news...  scott and colleen came over tonight to share pictures (scott got back 3 rolls of film going back to january and colleen got some back from the weekend at the gardens today) and to watch a movie (watched "bend it like beckham")...  at 1am when we were done, we headed for a diner for some late night dinner... there, we ran into ben, jason, and inessa (ben and jason are older math students, inessa just finished undergrad and has been dating jason for years)... we joined them for a bit, enjoyed our evening breakfast food, and then all headed home...   got home to witness a very drunk roommate doing things that hopefully won't happen again before i move out in august =P... who knows... enough said.  on that note, reading myself to sleep... night y'all =P
