I was wandering along some sooty black street     When I came across an ugly green dumpster. Inside I found a frightened young woman.  Her     Hair was tangled and greasy black, face smeared With grime - dark, dirty circles under endless hazel eyes.     She looked up at me from within her cage, a Wild animal in this urban jungle.  Her body quivered     As though I were about to strike her.  Instead, I brushed A damp newspaper aside and put my hand on her shoulder.     "Maria."  My voice was barely audible.  Her eyes Opened wide in surprise.  "You know my name?"  Her fear     Reminded me of a small child.  I reached around her Shoulders and pulled her up gently toward me; there was     A hesitancy, then she gave herself up. What was left of her wasted frame I scooped up into     My arms and carried to my car, to her salvation.
