It's Monday again..when I'm feeling blue, all I want to do, is nothing on Monday...haha...simple song to cheer me up...      Oh well, I guess things can't be all that bad,except that Liverpool was held to a draw with Tottenham, didn't sleep well last night and just had my timetable swapped for Friday....hai...at least I get to meet Eileen tonight..haha...      Class was slow today...noisy too...almost feel my throat straining after going in for just 3 periods. Maybe I had too many breaks for the last 2 weeks, so not in the mode to teach. Even PE lesson was tough for me today with students complaining that they don't want to play at all. Irritating!!!!! How come I wasn't like that in the past and kids nowadays just don't like PE?I tried to so hard to have an opportunity to play in the past and now kids don't even appreciate it at all when given the chances.
