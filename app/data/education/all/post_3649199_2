---------------------Sup Kids?------------------------- Ok, the other day i wrote a really sketchy post about the lakers losing as opposed to the Pistons winning. My arch-rival/friend KevMart disagrees. Maybe he'll write a guest column. Maybe not! It's just that he thinks he has it all and whatnot. I'll post it, completely unedited. whenever. Time to get on to the Bias part, kids. A little politics, a litte football HOF. ---------------------Bias------------------------------    I'm going to start this out with a little political observation, kids. My observation is this: Swing voters don't vote on issues. They vote on popularity-well, duh. My point is that no real prsident has been elected since Eisenhower (and that may be a stretch). Analysis: Dwight Eisenhower was voted on for a little think called the invasion of normandy, and people seemed to be caught up in the postwar effort, so they picked a guy they could say, "Hey! He was in WWII! Let's take him!". yeah. Then, JFK. JFKennedy was voted on b/c he happened to present himself for the firts televised debate. LBJ-TX, he succeded JFKennedy, of course, and just kept the wave. Nixon was voted on b.c 1)LBJ-TX didn't run, and 2)the sad event of Vietnam. Carter was elected b/c he wasn't Nixgate. Reagan was voted for b/c he wasn't Carter, re-voted b/c Mobdale, was well, short. GHWB, VPs usually are elected anyways. Clinton:he wasn't a continuation of the Reagan ideal. and Bob dole, was well, old. Gangsta Dub:he wasn't Clinton, he didn't have a history of Scandal. This year, it looks like JFKerry will be picked b/c he's not Gangsta Dub. But it'll be close. Now, time for football.       Year after year, some NFL vets/execs vote in football greats for the Pro Footbal Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. But you knew that. First, a fact that might surprise you. Year after year (again, i know), Jerome Bettis continues to surprise myself and the football world with the fact that he is 6th all time in yards. I think this is surprising, since he isn't the fastest guy around, and seems to be  justa short-yardage guy. But top 10? who knew. My second complaint is that Art Monk (WAS) isn't in the HOF. u're thinking he's a skins fan! No, i'm a dolphins guy, but good play deserves to be respected. Art Monk is 5th in Receptions, and 9th in reception yards, yet no1 votes him in, but they vote in execs no1s heard of. great. -------------------Bagels------------------------------    Nothing much, just that Dodgeball opens 2morrow. watch it!. Guest columns, please.
