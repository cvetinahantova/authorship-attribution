So unsure, so insecure, I was terrified of really doing anything because I was afraid of failing, and failing big. I talked about goals, but had no plan. I analyzed myself, but had no answers. I was playing the after-college find yourself game, all the while doing everything possible to lose myself.   My mom, who is my heart and reason, called me her ‘free spirit.’ On the last page of a tenderly created life photo album with images of me opening a longed-for tea set on my fourth birthday, sitting atop an elephant in the rose gardens of Bangkok, holding our beloved Sheltie, Smykket, and receiving my Girl Scout Gold Award she wrote:       Shannon: A Free Spirit   I love that about you. I would that I was so free. You are like a bird, singing its own sweet song – flying free and high. From time to time, you must alight and rest – but then again to soar. I pray that your spirit will reach the utmost heights. I pray that your wings may never be broken.      She gave meaning and allowance to my confusion, and kept me searching. My dad was the one who instilled the means.  ____________________________________________________________________________     Scientists can’t prove it’s genetic, but the Morley clan makes a strong case for hereditary wanderlust. My dad’s dad kept his family moving, one dusty town to another, always in search of a better job, a better home, a better life. My father was affected by the ‘other side of the hill’ obsession, too.   He became a United States Foreign Service Officer, and still is the most brilliant man I have ever known. Though, his newest decree not to cut his hair until Osama bin Laden has been captured brings this into some question.   I caught the bus of his whirlwind tour in Bangalore, India. By my senior year in high school, I had lived in Kenya, Thailand, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Norway with stateside turns in D.C, Texas and Hawaii.   My own case of other-longing didn’t start until my second year of college, but when it began, it struck hard. I rushed through the work, barely taking notice of the knowledge and graduated in three years. I thought I needed to get back overseas to the edgy world of color and culture.   Naturally, my first attempt was to take the Foreign Service exam. Apparently, my understanding did not sufficiently extend to the 48 varieties of flies in Chile, the conjugation pattern of Wadjiginy verbs and the conquests of Emiliano Zapata, because they never called.   The Peace Corps looked promising, but the dissertation-length paperwork took the organization so long to file, my stunted attention span switched strategies. Interestingly, I received my assignment letter to go to French-speaking North Africa a few months after I journeyed to Taiwan. By then, I was hooked by the Orient, or so it would seem the bizarre day I was arrested with six other women I had never met.   ____________________________________________________________________________     I began modeling at sixteen in Honolulu, and carried the super model dream through college. The Asian fashion market was a great money bed for Anglo models, so trying my face at it again seemed like a solid way to make a living while I was looking for my peace, or pieces depending on the point of reference.   I sat on the worn bamboo sofa of the Paper Moon Talent and Modeling Agency on Chien-Yi Road in downtown Taiwan. Still jet-lagged from the leap in time zones, but anxious to establish some income, I settled in for a chance to show my book to the agent. Down the hall from the noisy office, was a dorm set-up where several live-in Western models were watching television.   “Naw see you picta,” said a surprisingly round middle-aged woman. Her sooty black hair was razored close to her head and donut sized gold loops tugged at her earlobes. I opened my book and started to tell her about my experience. “No tawk,” she said flipping the slick pages of my portfolio between her red lacquered nails. “Ah, gud. You gud.” She seemed pleased and I leaned back to let her look.   The building’s mirrored double elevator doors opened directly into the office. Four Chinese men clad in gray-green uniforms escorted a Caucasian woman into the room and held up their badges. A single, slight but fierce officer began issuing what seemed to be orders as the others stood silently. The well-dressed woman accompanying the officers conversed with ease in Mandarin, gestured toward the dorm area and moved in that direction.   Ms. No Tawk jumped up and started yelling. Hoping to go unnoticed, I sat unmoving on the sofa, dodging eye contact.   The rapid banter continued for a few minutes until a lovely brunette teen emerged from her room, dragging a suitcase the size of a twin bed behind her. She followed the woman into the elevator as the officers fenced the entrance.   Another Chinese woman, who had been fielding calls since I arrived, hung up the phone and yelled in perfect English to the models in the back. “Get dressed and get out here. You’re going to the station with these men.”   Five minutes later, six leggy blondes moved into the office. Apparently unconcerned by the commotion, one was nibbling on a ripe, yellow star fruit and another was filing her pinky nail. Three of the officers corralled the girls into the now open elevator. Little Mao Tze Dong turned to join them, but stopped when he noticed me. He barked another question at the agent.   “Bu yao! Bu yao,” she answered. But, he headed for me and gestured for me to come. Too scared to object, I followed.   The other young women and I spent six hours inside a hollow interrogation hall drinking 7-up and taking escorted turns to the bathroom in fearful silence. My free spirit eventually got the best of me and I banged on a table and shouted, “I’m an American. I have rights!”   A few minutes later, the handsome white woman who seemed to have started this peculiar process opened the door. “Sorry for the inconvenience,” she said. “I’m from the Canadian Consulate. We were investigating an issue reported about your agency.” She paused and looked down. “We thought you were hookers. As soon as the police get your finger prints you can go.”   I started laughing at the absurdity of the supposition. She ignored me, turned and left. The Paper Moon secretary later informed me that one of the Canadian models staying with them had phoned her parents in Montreal and baselessly suggested that they were doing ‘more’ than modeling in Taipei.   Though off to a shimmy-shaky start, the rest of my stay in Taiwan was better than I had hoped. Of course, any place is splendid when you are in love.
