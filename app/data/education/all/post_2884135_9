The Morning Star   Sunrise is bursting with sunlight and full of joys, Singing all morning with grace and care, So, hence the beauty of nature gives me rejoices, And the forest of light bleeds raw and rare  Sunrise penetrates into your skin with warmness, Squirming yourself to death and with simpers, Shoulder for the morning star to burst with coolness, And the blue sky brightens up so pure and simple  Sunrise is forever shining on flowers fruitifully, Striving to emit the plethora of pollens with its bold, Soak the wintriness and to doctor them beautifully, And the meadow of flower shimmers radiant and gold  Sunrise embraces the beauty of life and arts, Siphoning in the light to magnify all dream parts, Sprinkle the stardust on the life's tender hearts, And it's time to hail our dearest morning star!   ~kekua  march 2004
