I have said it before, and I will say it again, these people rock my world!  We are all so close, we are all so happy. I can't think of somewhere I would rather be.  and the strange thing is that, even though we have only been on the trip for less than a month, it seems that living so close to so many people like we do, you feel after only a short period  of time that you have known these people for your entire life.  I am not looking forward to the end of this trip very much. I know how hard it is going to be to see these people leave. and i'm not at all looking forward to it.  cest la vie
