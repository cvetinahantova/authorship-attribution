.............................................................................................. top five bad things that have happened to me in the last week. ..............................................................................................  (not in order of importance)  1. i sliced open my thumb on the severed edge of the top of a cream of celery soup can. lots of blood.  2. i haven't had time to schedule a haircut.  3. i didn't finish reading two papers by my friday class last week.  4. i forgot to bring some stuff into school for my wife earlier today.  5. something's wrong with my telephone at home.   What!?  Is it my fault that I've got a good life?  Did you *read* this blog last semester?  Last semester it sucked to be me.  I refuse to feel guilty for feeling ok about the world.   (i'm sure i just jinxed everything though.)  peace~
