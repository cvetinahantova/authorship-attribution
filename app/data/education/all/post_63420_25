Time for another Google-related post.  To see a visual representation of a URL and its related sites (meaning  similar  - using the Google search term "related:" ), look at the  urlLink TouchGraph Google Browser .  Enter a URL and see what other sites and pages are connected.  I'm not exactly sure how the results are derived.   When entering my own  urlLink home page , one of the highest related sites is a  urlLink Swedish entertainment site  .  Strange.
