We Are Your Overlords   What are the top ten rock and roll songs about an impendent ass-kicking?  I'm not sure, but  urlLink this is one of them , even when it is sung by stupid kittens.  I'm pretty sure, too, that Thin Lizzy has like four of the ten.  ("The Boys Are Back in Town," "Warrior," etc.)  "I've Got Something Against You," comes to mind, but perhaps that's just because I recently got Pixies Tickets.   Suggestions?
