On Saturday we went to  urlLink Litchfield  to watch  urlLink Brittany  perform in the color guard. They are a really good marching band and have the awards to show it.  So, when we brought Brit back home they gave us a gift bag with a baby hand and foot imprint kit and a set of baby booties. It's kind of surreal, but we're really going to have a baby! I guess it's really starting to sink in now.
