urlLink Wikipedia   This is a novel concept.  It is an encyclopedia that anyone can stop by and edit.  Despite the potential for abuse, Wikipedia seems to have been up successfully for several years now.   I tried my hand at editing a few topics anonymously.  I just added a few links and a small section on library instruction to the entry on Library.  It worked just fine.  I guess the community at Wikipedia has figured out ways to counter abusive, vandal minded, and crankpot contributors.  If Wikipedia ever got big, I think the model Wikipedia would fail.  It would be abused just like Usenet is.  However, as it doesn't get a lot of attention yet, it still works.  Watch out though if it ever gets a decent Google pagerank.  Every spammer on Earth will try to place their links everywhere.  But maybe the Wikipedians could handle it.  I wish them luck and I think I'll contribute to the project a little myself.
