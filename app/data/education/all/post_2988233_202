Renee, Stan and  urlLink Savannah  left this morning for Chapel Hill. They start all the  urlLink tests  on Savannah in the morning, and finish up Thursday.  It is going to be a fast paced, rough couple of days for them.    In about 3-4 weeks, they should have the test results back, and she will be put on the UNOS list, (to get a cadaver liver) up until they do the living donor transplant from her mom.  Whichever happens first will be which liver she gets.    Savannah has to be sedated for two of the tests, so keep her in your thoughts and prayers.
