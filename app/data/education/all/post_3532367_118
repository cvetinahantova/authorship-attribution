Well I don't know what to think about my first "session". The counselor was young and didn't really seem to be asking the right questions. "Do I wash my hands a lot, or do I have to have things in order, or do things have to be in a straight line?"  I knew exactly what she was trying to get at, but her questions came out of a leaflet and did not relate to me personally. I found it very difficult to talk to her (not like with the doctor at all) and came away feeling disappointed.   She originally decided to give me a leaflet to take home on obsessive, compulsive behaviour, but then changed her mind at the last minute to one about Depression. She also suggested I contact Relate.   The one thing she did do, was to suggest a referral to the Mental Health Unit for a full assessment. I said yes to this, but mainly because I got the impression that she didn't know what she was doing.
