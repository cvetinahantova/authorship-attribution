Just phoned up for another appointment to be told there weren't any until the 2nd August (this woman is seriously pissing me off, I have no faith in her). She is going to put me on the list for cancellation cover. I have given my mobile, just in case. The passing comment....."Shame you didn't ring earlier, you could have come in this afternoon" ...........aaaarrrrgggghhhhh!
