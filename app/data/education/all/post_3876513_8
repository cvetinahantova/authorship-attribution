"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is a wonderful piece of British humour that one of these days I really will have to re-read.  My favorite character is Marvin, the depressed robot.  In "The Resturant at the End of the Universe", the other characters find him at a resturant where he's been waiting for them to show up for years and years and years.  (I think he spent one of those years with his head in a bucket of water.)  It's been very, very boring.  And he's reverted to writing poetry.  Now I lay me down to sleep. Try to count electric sheep. Good night wishes you can keep. How I hate the night.  Now I lay me down to rest. Darkness won't engulf my head. I can see by infared. How I hate the night.  I'm not sure if that's exactly right--it's been a long time since I've read it.  But I empathise.  I've had such a hard time getting to sleep lately.  I was taking allergy medication that would konk me out, but I don't like taking it every day.  Last night I didn't get tired until after 3.  "How I hate the night."
