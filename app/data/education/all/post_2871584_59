Kris and I got together today after she ran the Boilermaker, and it was so nice to see her.  It's weird.  She's one of those people that I see once, maybe twice a year, but as soon as we see each other, it's like no time has passed at all.  When she got here, we went out for some food.  In honor of old traditions, we went to Ponderosa for brunch.  We sat and talked for so long that our server was getting annoyed, so then we came back to my apartment.  We caught up on all sorts of stuff, and filled each other in on any gossip that we had heard.  It was just so nice to relax and hang out.    After she left, I sat down to read, and passed out on the couch for a couple of hours.  After only being able to sleep for about three hours last night though, it was nice to get in a little more sleep.  Now I'm just hoping that I'll be able to fall asleep tonight.  I've been sleeping well for almost two weeks now, and I would prefer to keep it that way.
