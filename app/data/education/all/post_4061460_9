I went into school today, and Ms. Randall told me that I will be losing one of my TP 12 classes during second semester and picking up a CP 3 class instead. This probably doesn't sound like a big deal at all, but sometimes I feel like I get crapped on a lot. I'm the only teacher in the history of the school that has been devoid of a classroom for two consecutive years. When choosing our preferences for planning periods, all I asked for was "not 2nd block." I ended up with 2nd period planning both semesters. None of it alone is any big deal, but I sometimes wonder why I alone am expected to make these sacrifices. Why couldn't I sacrifice a little here and someone else sacrifice a little there so that none of us are entirely burdened. Some teachers feel they are already sacrificing a lot by allowing a teacher to float into their room, and I can understand how they would feel that is an inconvenience, but I think I would be pretty happy to change positions with them. I also know there are some teachers who are sacrificing nothing.  There's no use grumbling and groaning about it though. It's much better to focus on how good I have it than how poor some things seem to be. Still, it's nice to vent a little bit, and this seems like a reasonably safe place to do so.
