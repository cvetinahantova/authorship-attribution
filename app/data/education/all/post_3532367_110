Insomnia - the first song on the radio on the way in to work. "I can't get no sleep"....How apt!  02:30 was the best I managed, before Rob came into our bed feeling unwell. He has been for a couple of days, but last night was a bad night for him....and me! I just couldn't get out of bed today - 06:30 the alarm goes off, it turns off at 07:30 and I was still in bed at 07:45. Just about got into work for 09:00!  I feel a bit stiff after the football last night - it was a good work out, I broke into a sweat (for the first time ever) but felt afterwards, that I could have done more. I also got a nice friction burn on my knee, from the astro turf pitch.   I went straight from there to a parents evening with the violin teacher. Some good comments about the work being put in by Louise to her ability to read music, rather than just remembering the tune. By the time we got home, there was just enough time for tea, before going to bed at 22:00.
