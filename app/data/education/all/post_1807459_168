So I'm here at the beach but it's raining.  Really it isn't bad I just hope it clears up so I can zip around some more on the motto bike I rented.  It only cost $3 but still it's a lot of fun.  I spent the morning zooming around town, checking out different beaches and managed to locate the post office to drop my postcards off at.  But now that it's afternoon it seems the rain has come and hopefully not settled in for the day.   I stayed up last night watching the funeral for Regan.  Very moving I must say.  Then this morning when I woke it is was during the final good-bye in California.  I watched most of this as well.  I don't remember that much about him as I was only 10 when he left office but it was great to see so many leaders come together and honor him.   Ok looks like the rain is easing up a bit.  I think I'll grab some lunch and then get on my way.  I'll head back to Phnom Penh tomorrow and then I'll go to Vietnam on Monday.  I'm pretty much ready to get out of Cambodia.  Well I have a motto bike with a full tank of gas waiting on me.
