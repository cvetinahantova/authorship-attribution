Finally finished my  urlLink concept map  on Instructional Design. Basically my views are centered around the business goals and the delivery. Don't have a lot of sound pedagogical knowledge to contribute (which is actually the main reason for taking this course, and hey, is this a critical incident?). I think the four components that are important will be the  learning goals, business goals, learning platform,  and  the learner . I think these four components have enough divisible elements in order to be treated in its own right.
