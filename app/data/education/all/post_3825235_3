thump.  thump thump thump.   What's that sound???   THUMP    THUMP A.    That's Gigi's car!   Haha.  My friend came over today and rewired my sound system in my car (thanks, man!)  because it wasn't working correctly.  No, I did not blow a speaker (darn!), but I had problems in the, uh, wiring, DUH!  So, now you can hear my car from  way  far away.  Even farther than when I first had it put in.  I'll let you know the count on car alarms that I set off...HEHEHE!  (I'm not a bad person...my own car alarm is very sensitive and goes off when people drive by with their systems blaring, sometimes.)   ...Random question alert!   Have you ever realized how nice it feels to just wash your feet?  I had taken a shower before I made my last post, but when my friend was working on my car, I was outside without shoes on, and my feet got all dusty and dry.  So, when I came back in, I just washed my feet in the shower, and it felt   SO   nice.  And, I'm still tired--as opposed to when I take a full-fledged shower late in the day and it wakes me up and makes it so I don't want to go to bed at night.   AbbieDabbie had NO problem going to sleep tonight.  AWWR!  I guess with everything we did this weekend, she was still tired...who'd've thunk?  Tired, after being at the lake for a day and a half, and without any naps...hmmph!  I better get in bed, too.  We've got a big day planned for tomorrow!  G'night!
