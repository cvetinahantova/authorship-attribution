we learnt san dan waza today. combination of  1)kote,men,men 2)men,men,men 3)kote,men,kote training as always is very tiring but the feeling at the end is satisfying. however today i felt as if we were not pushed as hard as wednesday and that is kind of unsatisfying. contradicting my statements aren't i. i have decided on a physical training system which will supplement my learning of kendo. hopefully at the end of a month, i will be fitter and will want more torturing session from peter sansei.
