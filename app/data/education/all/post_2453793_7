one of my favorite things about christmas is eating pink cookies.  they are so good.  i'm petsitting right now...i love dogs.  i'm happy to be "home" too and see my 5 dogs.  they make me so happy.  i desperately need to get my own puppy for up in minnesota.  it's so weird coming down here and not having any snow whatsoever.  i have the strongest urge to move out west...washington or oregon...or possibly colorado.  i miss the fresh air.  i bought one of my roommates such a thoughtful christmas gift...the one that i can't tell if he really hates me or not.  i wonder if he'll think it's thoughtful and care that i got it for him.  i ordered it all of the way from his old hometown - whitefish, montana.  i like giving presents...but i hate picking them out.  for some odd reason i've been really good at picking out presents lately.  i've been really creative when it comes to that...and writing poetry.  i think it's because i feel like i'm getting to know people better so i can actually get them things they would like because i really know what they would like.  i've never really had close friends because i moved around so much and was so shy.  that's why it hurts so much to know that these guys are starting to hate me and want me out of their lives...they are my 3 closest friends and i don't think they realize how much they mean to me and how much i want them in my life.
