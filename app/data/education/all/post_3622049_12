I had a really nice chat ;) with one of my guy friends on AIM the for the 4th of July. It's funny when you reconnect with an old friend and he's become what you thought he was always just joking about being.  Apparently from my parents house I have a lot harder time updating.  Mostly because their computer is in the living room and I don't like it when people walk by.  The sibs tend to try and read whatever I'm working on without realizing it might be private.  I am so glad I have my own place, even though I have to share it with a roomate.  I'd rather have a husband and family of my own, but this was the hand I was delt and I guess I just have to live with it. The ex e-mailed me today a short note to ask how our little one is doing.  I thought about e-mailing him back with, "If you want to know, get off your lazy ass and call her." but I refrained.  I don't mind him so much, other than the fact that nothing can make him happy and he's always gripping.  It's the new wife I hate.  Damn bitch.
