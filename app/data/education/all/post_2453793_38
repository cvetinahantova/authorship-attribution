so i ended up going to cracker barrel alone.  a little bit after getting there, i noticed that kurt & shea were there.  i said hi and they pretty much ignored me and pretended i wasn't there.  kurt barely looked at me, however, he did talk to me briefly.  i don't know.  maybe they were afraid that i wanted to join them...which is silly because i know that if they had wanted me to join them, they would have asked me to go in the first place.  i just think it's pretty immature.  they must really not like me anymore.  i guess i was mistaken.
