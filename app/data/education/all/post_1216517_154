THE RICE, PYTHONS, AND BRIAN     I learned how to cook rice.  I cooked a lot of it yesterday.  It's still setting on the stove.  I think I'll go eat it now.  Yum.  I've been writing a lot.  I hope something comes of it.  Jesse and I have been working on short films to send up to Trevor.  That guy needs to move down here soon, but that's a whole different topic.  I'm doing the read through the Bible in a year thing.  Now i'm in Exodus in what I sometimes call the 'boring' part.  That's kinda sad on my part.  It just frustrates me when they say things five times: "sacrifice the lamb on the fifth day.  On the fifth day you shall sacrifice the lamb.  And when the lamb has been sacrificed on the fifth day, over an insence sacrifice after the fifth day.'  repeatative, ya know.  It reminds me a lot of  urlLink monty python and the holy grail.        This part in particular:   LAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade. ARTHUR: Yes, of course! The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch! 'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him. Brother Maynard! Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade! MONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. ARTHUR: How does it, um-- how does it work? LAUNCELOT: I know not, my liege. ARTHUR: Consult the Book of Armaments! BROTHER MAYNARD: Armaments, chapter two, verses nine to twenty-one. SECOND BROTHER: And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this Thy hand grenade that, with it, Thou mayest blow Thine enemies to tiny bits in Thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu-- MAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother. SECOND BROTHER: And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.' MAYNARD: Amen. KNIGHTS: Amen. ARTHUR: Right! One!... Two!... Five! GALAHAD: Three, sir! ARTHUR: Three! [angels sing] [boom]   That reminds me...i just watched 'life of brien'.  I'm hoping the pastor preaches on that next sunday.     Here's a summary of that film from  urlLink imdb :  1st watched 6/4/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Terry Jones): Mostly unfunny movie based on a child born in a manger next to Jesus called Brian. Some of Monty Python's humor comes through, but it doesn't seem to work too well in this setting. I think that if it wasn't in reference to Jesus Christ they could have made this movie funny. The movie itself does not make fun of christians or Jesus but rather things in the time like stonings, lepers, and the Romans. The funniest scene in my opinion just happens to be the last of the movie where one of the crucified breaks out into song about looking at the bright side of life. There were not enough funny scenes to recommend this movie. Their best in my opinion is still their earliest 'The Holy Grail.'     urlLink Here's  the entire script if you've got some time on your hands.  I don't really recommend this movie.  i just thought it was really interesting.  Anyway...
