Hot and Humid, Hot and Humid.....BLOODY hot and humid.... As usual slacked whole day....okie lah....i still did some excercise with my dumbells and did some skipping. My wrist hurts....old injury...still remember my action packed slam dunk during sec 3 on one of the primary school basketball court. I fractured my elbow and wrist. Nearly missed the B division badminton competition becos of this.  Till now i still experience pain on these two fracture points...especially after excercising and kayaking. Can easily hear craking sound whenever i rotate my wrist.  Damnz.....i oni watched 30 mins of the match between England and Portugal. Buay tahan liao and went to sleep.....shitz....in the end the match is so exciting.Dont think i going to stay up tonite unless i can find something to do while waiting to solve the boredom problem.   Signing off: I'm in pain....someone give me MORPHINE!!!!!!   Never Believe in Never cos you Never Know
