So the big news today is that   Friends  final episode is tonight. I don't know, I just don't think its that big of a deal. Its not that I don't care about TV shows or anything. I'm not going to pretend like I have this big moral high ground to sit on or something. I would be totally lying if I said I do not become very invested in my television watching. I was devistated when  Seinfeld  went off the air, and I cried buckets at the series finale of   The Wonder Years . But in reality, I don't think I will miss  Friends  that much.  Listen, I don't think its a bad show. It might be a little over-rated, but in fact, I think its generally pretty funny. However, I've never been invested in the show. The more the writers and producers tried to make me care about the characters, the less I did. Monica and Chandler get married? Rachel has a baby? Joey and Rachel are in love? Pheobe marries Mike? The producers wanted me to say, "awwww..." but I was just felt "eh." The show became less about being funny and more about "Look at us grow up and mature and you care about us and our lives." Not so much.   Unlike  Seinfeld  that really left in its prime,  Friends  has overstayed its welcome. The characters have become charactetures of themselves. Monica was never that crazy, or Joey that dumb, or Ross that boring in the early episodes. And like I said, the focus changed considerably and the show became a lot less funny.  So though I plan on watching it tonight, I don't expect there to be any surprises. I'm sure the whole thing will wrap itself up in a nice little bow, and maybe they'll pump enough schmaltz into the whole deal to make some viewers (not me) shed a tear or two. And then that will be that, and I can watch Survivor without having to share the remote with my roommates who want to watch  Friends .  urlLink  postCount('108388552053498296');
