urlLink TIMSS: What Have We Learned about Math and Science Teaching? ERIC Digest.  This ERIC Digest is by Greene, Beth D.,  Herman, Marlena and Haury, David L.  From the ERIC Digest:  The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), conducted during the 1994-95 school year, has been used extensively to compare the mathematics and science achievement of students and the instructional practices of schools worldwide. TIMSS followed in the wake of other reports and documents (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989; 1995; American Association for the Advancement of science, 1989, 1993; Executive Office of the President, 1990) that have focused attention on the importance, conditions, and goals of science and mathematics education. In addition to providing data on the progress of U.S. students towards national goals, TIMSS has enabled comparisons of some U.S. educational practices to those of other countries. Tests were designed to reflect the mathematics and science curricular goals of several TIMSS countries, and students in both public and private schools were tested three levels: 9 years of age, 13 years of age, and those in their final year of secondary school.   CRITICAL QUESTIONS  In the U.S., the TIMSS data have been used to address five main questions: (1) How does student knowledge of mathematics and science in the U.S. compare to that of students in other nations? (2) How do science and mathematics curricula and expectations for student learning in the U.S. compare to those of other nations? (3) How does classroom instruction in the U.S. compare with that of other nations? (4) Do U. S. teachers receive as much support in their efforts to teach as do their counterparts in other nations? and (5) Are U. S. students as focused on their studies as their international counterparts? (USDOE, 1997, p. 4).
