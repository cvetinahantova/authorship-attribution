To be loved...   It feels so nice to be loved... To know that one's passage doesn't go unnoticed. This night was a great revelation to me. A great emotional weight was lifter off more than just one person this night, and I think everything is better just for that. There are others that I need to talk to as well... Maybe with time, I'll find the courage to do so. I hope.
