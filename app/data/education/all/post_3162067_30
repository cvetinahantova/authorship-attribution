Hurrah, it's that weekend feeling, coupled with that bad-back feeling which has made me lie on my desk at work today, mush to the amusement of my classes. My back was much better this morning, but now it's aching with the pressure of a long day behind it. Today, having said that, was quite good. Again, it wasn't what you'd call challenging (I'm beginning to like Fridays a lot more now that year 11 are no longer with us). My year 9's were ace this afternoon: apparantly the supply teacher they had while i was off sick was an absolute bastard. He made them work!! Shock horror!!! But he shouted at them quite a lot, made several cry, refused to let them use dictionaries and told a dyslexic student to 'have a guess' at a word she wanted help with. Suffice to say, they realised how lucky they were to have me as their teacher and they were very good, worked well and made me promise not to be ill again until the end of term. A promise I'm very happy to try and keep as I hate taking time off work when I feel I shouldn't. Well, I'm going to attempt to clean the flat now as mum and Alex are popping in tomorrow, before we go back to their house for the weekend (dammit, now I've spoiled the illusion: my flat isn't always tidy!!!) I'm having a bridesmaid dress fitting tommorrow (and I'm paying off a huge hunk of my wedding dress too) and I'm having my hair cut in the mrning. I'm in two minds about this. Part of me wants an image change. Plus, my hair needs to be shorter so that I can style it nicely for Anna's wedding, and I have lots of split ends, and it's so difficult to manage and I want it to look stylish for my job interview, and it rarely looks good these days. It tangles easily and I have no time to spend on it. But I like having long hair. It suits me. But then, my hair hasn't looked great for ages. But I want it long for my wedding. But my long hair looks fab in those photos i had taken last year. God, how vacuous am I?
