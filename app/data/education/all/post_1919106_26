Rain   I liked yesterday. It rained a lot, but not too much. Reminded me of the summer showers back at home. There is nothing nicer than taking a rowing boat out through the Parana delta on a rainy summer day: It keeps you cool, you don't have to worry about getting sunburnt, and there are less assholes in powerboats out there, which translates into less waves, which makes me a happy, happy Panda. But then again I haven't touched a rowing boat for ages... not as if there are any here in Corpus.
