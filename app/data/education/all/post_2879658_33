Several weeks ago Steph, Danola, Kristel and I had written in our Jet diaries that we would have dinner at Lock Up on Saturday night.  Well, on Friday night Danola made me call the restaurant to make the reservation because she finally talked to Jemma and now knew how many of us could go.  They made me call because neither one of them wanted to have to speak Japanese and since I had been drinking for a couple hours at the enkai, I really wasn't bothered by having to call.  Anyway, we met at the Disney Store and headed to where it used to be.  Yea, not there anymore.  We called the restaurant and they told us it was on the third floor of the building.  Unfortunately, Lock Up is no longer there and a new Chinese Restaurant had taken our reservation.  Not really wanting Chinese food, we headed back down to the street on a quest for a good meal.  We were definitely a bit disappointed as Lock Up is supposed to be really cool because they handcuff you and every table is in a jail cell and the waiters are dressed appropriately and so it is quite an amusing evening.  Oh well...
