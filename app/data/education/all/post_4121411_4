Yesterday was supposed to be ahappy occasion..that Eileen and I will meet up and have dinner with Ron and his wife. Turns out that the places we wanted to go were not open for business and we have to change the location twice. Had to settle for 85 market in the end. Still, things seem to be going really then until we left Rona and Sharon after the durian feast. I did some stuff that I really regreted and we hardly seem to be able to talk to each other after that. It been weighing on my mind the whole night and hardly had a good rest. I wonder how Eileen is today. I hope and pray that she is ok...
