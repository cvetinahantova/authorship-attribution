I want to insightful but I'm just not in that kind of mood.  I think I've come to the conclusion that the owners of LIKE are bound and determined to destroy their company at all costs.  These people just blow my mind with how little they do to help their own cause.  I just can't figure out why I care so much.  I think I've finally caught back up on sleep from the China trip.  Oh in good news my water now works.  I didn't explain before but when I got back on Sunday I came back to an apartment with no running water.  This was just awesome.  Time is flying and I can't believe people are going to be leaving soon.  This will certainly put a different spin on the social life here.  I'm ready for spring, forget this winter crap I'm done with it.  Being in Shanghai really makes me want to move to somewhere else.  I think I'll look for a real job in somewhere like Hong Kong or Singapore.   I have a student whose nickname is now ddong-juice.  For those of you that don't work in Korea ddong is Korean for poop.  He was trying to be a smart ass and I guess I got him back good b/c now all the kids call him that.  I feel a little bad.   I'm sure there is more I want to say but it just isn't coming to me.
