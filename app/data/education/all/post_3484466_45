I apologize for being a bit slow on the updating, but I've been working hard. Actually, today I went and drove around and had a bit of fun. I never realized Computer Concepts had such kickass prices on games. I got Decent II, Gunman, Dark Earth, Phantasmagoria, and Rebel Assault II all for $5. It was grand.  Yes, anyway. I took apart our launcher and redid most of it with string, and it looks so much better, it's crazy. It's not quite finished, but we've got a couple of class days, so I'll finish tying it up in class tomorrow, and then we can calibrate it with a piece of string. I'll be redoing the blueprint on the computer tomorrow, to make sure it is perfect, because that's what I do.  Right, finally, I played a bit of StarCraft today, with Nate, Matt, and Kyle, and I must say I've missed our big 2 vs. 2 games... they're really a lot of fun.  Well, I'm working on my digital Periodic Table of the Elements for something Nate needs done in science, so I'm going to get back to work. I'm in a really good working mood right now...
