Another semester can be marked into the history books, now, to take advantage of my three weeks of freedom from classes.  I really look forward to my time off and not quite sure how I will partition my time.  We just finished up with Organizational Behavior, which I must admit, was a quite interesting topic.  I wouldn’t mind doing a bit more independent research on my own.  Luckily, my wife’s master’s degree focuses on this, so maybe I will just try to pry my way into what she is learning.    Two more semesters left until the big graduation day!
