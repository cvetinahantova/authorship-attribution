Funny how  urlLink labor laws can be called blue laws and no one thinks twice .   True, the laws in question were legislated in a religious context, but the idea that 24 consecutive hours off is an  outdated  benefit scares me a bit.  The connotation is clear: such laws make no more sense than the ones that keep liquor stores closed on Sundays or make adultery a punishable crime.    My favorite part of the article:   Pam Reynolds, manager of Reynolds Funeral Service in Waynesboro, said the laws would seriously impact her business.   "I can't imagine how we would do that," she said. "People die seven days a week. We respond in shifts. If we get a call, we have to go."    And you know what, Pam?  People have always died that way.
