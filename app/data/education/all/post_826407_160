I think I more or less agree with the direction  urlLink Matt's  going in about Pluralism, Brian McClaren and CS Lewis (I think Being found by God is probably a better description).  I'm getting quite wary about limiting God's ability to find and save people.   I've heard it and said it before (so much so that its almost a cliche) but I do think the key is to find what God's doing and get along side it, not prescribe what we believe God should be doing and refuse to accept anything else.    urlLink Jonny Baker  has found some more excellent flash animations.  The  urlLink Ni9e  site is amzing.  Well worth just exploring at leisure.  I loved the typographic illustrations and  urlLink starfish  the most.  The  urlLink 24/7 Lords Prayer  is very powerful too.  The new issue of  urlLink emerginchurch.info  is very good.  It includes  urlLink Jonathan's  post asking the emerging west to broaden their horizons a little and two non-western stories by way of response.  Very inspiring, very challenging.  I loved  urlLink Andrew Jone's  poem,  urlLink sTorm  and like the new site design too.  I've just seen that he's coming to Sheffield soon too.  Can anyone enlightne me a bit about this visit?  Thanks  urlLink Andy  for the link to  urlLink ChavScum .  It made me laugh a lot although I was a little concerned about the levels of hate found there. Can see some of my kids going that way!  Enjoyed  urlLink Dave's  stories about D3, Profile and 24/7 a lot too.  Mate, its so cool watching your life right now.  I've been admiring from afar the  urlLink Grace Lent Blog .  Only one more week to go!
