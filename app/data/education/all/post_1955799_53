I had too much caffene.  As a result, I was up late, and couldn't go to sleep.  I think I may have dozed off around 6:00 AM.  That sucked, and I'm still not sleepy.    Went to See Matrix Revolutions today.  It was ok.  I didn't like the ending, whic I won't spoil for anyone.   How cool would that be?  Yesterday I worked on improving pages for my image project.  We'll see how that  goes.  I'd like to see it completed.  I could then move onto my final project.
