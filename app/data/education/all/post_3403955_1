The sun is out and the sky is blue the day would only be better if I were spending it with you. Your goofy grin and the way you call me kid. You make me happy, you make it feel right. The way you joke and talk seriuous with me there is no one with whom I would rather be. The only thing is you see me as a sister not as a woman to brag about "hey I kissed her". I am the friend who will always be not the one you will come to on bended knee.
