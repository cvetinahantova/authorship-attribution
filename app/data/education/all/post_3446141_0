Ok I have decided that the reason for the crazy dreams is because I'm keeping my parents dog and she wakes me up in the morning around 5 or 6 and then I go back to bed and have crazy dreams.  The one from tonight, not as morbid!!  I was lost in LR?!?  I was driving home from my parents and I took the wrong exit and got lost in the straight up ghetto, but some nice hookers helped my find my way home......lol.  Very wierd.  Cindy (the dog) leaves today!!  I will finally get a full nights sleep without having to get up to let her out! YAY.
