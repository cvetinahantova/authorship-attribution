urlLink    This bridge over the New River Gorge is the longest structure of its type in the world. It used to take 40 minutes to wind down the canyon, cross the bridge down there, and wind back up. I was interested to hear that the hills one either side are riddled with abandonned coal mines, which made the construction especially hard.Â  urlLink
