urlLink TheButterflySite.com Butterfly Award Â­ Here is a site that gives an award for family safe sites.  While the FamilFriendlySites.com site I blogged the other day is a directory, TheButterFlySite.com is a butterfly site!  Despite this, it has its own web award.  Here are the listed criteria:  "We offer an award to sites that are family-safe, well designed, easy to navigate, and have few pop-up windows. Please submit your name and email, the website name and address, and a brief description. We will review the website, then upon approval, send an invitation to list our award on the site with instructions. Websites that receive our award will also receive a link from TheButterflySite.com under Award Winning Sites."  Seems simple enough.  As I wrote a few days ago, I like the idea of fidning and identify kid safe sites.  Maybe my local public librarian won't censor the Web, but I sure want to be able to censor the web for my kids.  Any tool that can help is welcome.
