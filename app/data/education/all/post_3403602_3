Well today I went back to skool. Ugh. Skool sux now. Its all gay and stuff. Uhmmm...Yeah. Anyways were gonna start on this Kat 6 shit. Ugh. Stupid stuff to do. I dont see the point of doing it. Its pretty much a big waste of time. All they wanna do is scare us. Some of my teachers say that it goes toward yer final grade. thats dum if it does. Which i know it doesnt. God! I swear Im gonna kick Aronld Shortza-whatevr's ass. Anyways enough about Mr. Germany Nazi Man...I like ice cream. Uhmmm...Espeacilly Mint and Rocky Road. Its soo yummy for yer tummy. Lol. Anyways. I hate Carmen San Diego. Die Bitch Die. I think writing songs is great. Cuz you can express yerself in many ways. Thats sounds like an essay or some shit. But yeah. I hate when people say that cant write a song. I mean no one can but you can write poems and stuff. Some dont like to express thier feelings. Geez whats wrong with it? I do it all the time, and believe me I do. Lol. But yeah. Music needs to stay with you yer whole life. And if you dont listen to music then you smoke crack. J/k. No but you need to listen to all types of music. Not just one. I suggest Liz Phair. AWSOME ASS CHICK! She rocks my wrrrld. But Im mad at her cuz she has this one guitar I like and I wanna kill her. Lol. Well yeah Bye!!XoxO
