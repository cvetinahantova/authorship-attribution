my laptop decided to be retarded this morning, so i've been working on my desktop in my room... with the windows open because it's a gorgeous day!  but riddle me this...  there are two kids, who i'd guess to be junior high age, on the playground outside my window.  they've (both of them boys) got their shirts off and are using them to scoop up large amounts of gravel and throw it all down the slide  for as much as i enjoy playgrounds, this is one activity i've never really understood... and i'm getting tired of the gravel grating on metal sound...   blah... up to 296 -- for sure i'll hit 350 today, 400 if i'm lucky... wish me luck!
