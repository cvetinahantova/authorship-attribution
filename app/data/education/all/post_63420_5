The times....they've already changed.  As I was deciding what to enter here tonight - what great pearls of wisdom, new techie finds, or random babblings - I was thinking about how much communication has changed on the Internet.    Earlier this year a  urlLink mailing list about ultramarathons  that I stated with a fellow runner had its tenth anniversary.  Ten years on the same software ( urlLink LISTSERV ) and same host ( urlLink Dartmouth College .)  The school may have upgraded their computers during this time, but the hosts still don't crack the 1Ghz processor speed.    At that time the argument for discussion platforms was mailing lists (LISTSERV, Majordomo, eventually Lyris) vs. newsgroups.  While newsgroups (especially Usenet - though  urlLink Google Groups  is certainly a great tool for researching newsgroups) seemed to have quieted a bit over the years, mailing lists are still strong and have gained competition in recent years from web forums.  Blogs and easy to use software like  urlLink Contribute  allow anyone - yes, anyone - to publish on the web.    Definitely easier accessibility.  Definitely more noise.
