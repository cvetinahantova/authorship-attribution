Vanilla Sky is a very, very cool movie. I love movies that make you think like that... You know... those movies that the general public absolutely hates, because they're too stupid to understand them? The only movies like that that get any respect are the film festival ones, because they're often expected to be weird. Meh, whatever. Society sucks, anyway.  Current Music: Gary Jules - Mad World
