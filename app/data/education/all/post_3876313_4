Today was rough.  I had morning sickness the entire day.  It seems to come in waves.  I did manage to stay at work all day.  That is my goal each day.  Just make it through.    This weekend was good.  We became members at the Arboretum.  I hope to walk a lot there when our lil peanut is here.    My Grandma and Sue with the help of my aunt Pat got me a bunch of maternity clothes.  That was awesome.  I now have tons of outfits.  What an incredibly helpful thing for them to do.  It is so hard to find time and especially energy to go out and shop.
