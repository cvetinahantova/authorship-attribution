Besides all that angelic excitement, Putu has been catching up on the reading as well. And speaking of reading, Hurree Babu on Kitabkhana has blogged an interesting list of  urlLink books to be read twice (or not).  And BookSlut links to an article in SFGate that ponders the immortal question,  urlLink Why aren't butt-kicking superheroines getting film debuts?  A question rendered interesting by its timing, coinciding with the release of Catwoman. Putu shakes a weary head at all desperate-to-fill-space journalists (part of Putu vaguely remembers being one). Though  urlLink this cartoon  is interesting. But best link of the day by far is this extract from a book on the Guardian website. I'd tell you what it was about, but I'm  urlLink too lazy  to type any more.
