The doctor's report is in......... it's not the arthritis! The eye doctor says that I have really bad allergies! Woo hoo hooray for allergies!!! I always get to be the guinea pig for people who are learning how to become doctors, like when I go see my arthritis doctor he always has an intern there and they have to make a diagnosis of how they think I am doing and then my doctor will ask a question about my situation and they have to answer it like a quiz. Today in at my eye appointment there were three people looking at me, the real doctor and two other people I didn't even get introduced to. The main doctor looked at my eye then left asking the other person to look and make a diagnosis, then the second person asked the third person if he wanted to look at my eyes and he was like of course! I was very weird cuz all three of them came up with what to do with me. I was just so relieved that it didn't have anything to do with my arthritis that when he was telling me instructions for medicine I almost started to cry I could hear in my voice that I was choked up the lady just looked at me funny, hee hee. God is just so good to me, I was so nervous today but I knew that no matter what God's got my back he will still be there to hold me up, he will always be right by my side. He's just so awesome.
