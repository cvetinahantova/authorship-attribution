"I'm so tired Of being here..."   The Seahawk Invitational was really cruddy. I hated it. My race was third from the last, so I had to wait three or four hours in the pouring rain and twenty-degree weather, with the only thing I could do being to cheer on my other teammates. Things looked up though, and it stopped raining (or at least it stopped  pouring ) in time for my race, and I got a personal record by 12 seconds and got a ribbon for 6th place. It was terrible, and still not too bad...ironic, eh?  I made cupcakes last night.  I sold tickets to Wizard of Oz today.  I got in a big fight with my dad.  Now Mom's coming home from Germany and I'm exhausted and in a crappy mood. I want a hug...:-( Not to mention I still have three English projects to finish by tomorrow.  Man, life sucks sometimes...   "I've been alone All along..."
