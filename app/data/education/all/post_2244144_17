In a recent study,  urlLink 28% of people were fooled by fraudulent e-mails . Now I know that the majority of my audience is teenagers who most likely do not know how many digits are on a credit card so my advice is probably not worthwhile to anyone who will read this. But since I like to post at least something everyday, here it is anyway.  Do not trust outbound links in your e-mail box. Even if it is a valid claim and the site is the same as it appears, it will be more worthwhile to just open up a new tab (and if you do not know what that is, please stop using Internet Explorer) and type in the site that it claims to be.  Just to see how easy it is to be fooled, go ahead and take  urlLink this survey .
