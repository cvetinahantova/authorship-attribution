Hello, everybody!  I wasn't expecting to have quite the day I did. I woke up this morning, intending on going to summerfest...Instead, we ended up having J's family and his co-worker (see an earlier post-the guy with the bottle).  Didn't even decide to do it until about 2:30...so we hit the grocery store, dropped 60 bucks, came home, and started making stuff.  I made a yellow cake with chocolate frosting, we had cole slaw, potato salad, baked beans, fruit salad, burgers, hot dogs, chips, and Rotel dip.  All in all, it was pretty good.  I don't have class tomorrow because of the holidays, but J has to work for about half a day.  I plan on going to the parade, probably with my mother-in-law, partly to see J's co-worker on the Modine parade float.  He'll be the only guy among 20 women or so!! Ha!    I've been trying to practice for my French exam I have to take in September. I'm NOT lookig forward to it, and I'm half scared I will fail.  It's a VERY difficult test it seems-listening to a non-native speaker say a sentence in French (with no visual help) and figuring out what their error was.  Ugh.  Please please, dear God, let me pass this test-if I don't, I can't student teach in the spring which means no license for me.  Let's see, what else?  I think that's it, really. Yay.
