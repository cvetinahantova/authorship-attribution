'Twas the last supper tonight with high school friends. Turns out Carmen and I are leaving on the same day..it was still somewhat surreal (I guess it will be until I'm at the airport) saying our goodbyes 'n stuff. All I can say is that I'm so very lucky to have met all of these special people. And no, I don't mean "handicapped" when I say "special". Thank you so much Aliza for hosting and putting so much work into this!!  I hope Peter didn't have a Homer moment from the "Lisa's Pony" episode driving home tonight (" urlLink Homer falls asleep in the doorway, the automatic doors opening and closing on his head.  He drives home and nods off at the wheel. When we return to reality, we see that the car has driven through a fence, and it careens into the Simpsons garage (taking out the mailbox and the storage shelf in the garage).  A falling circular saw clonks Homer on the head, though it doesn't seem to rouse him from his slumber.  Homer sleepwalks into bed, where the alarm goes off nary a second later .")  It is now 5:03 AM. Dear Lord how time flies with these friends! And yet I feel the need to stay up to watch the end of Pretty in Pink. I hate this movie. And yet I find James Spader to be kinda sexy in it. Go figure.  Some highlights from the night:              The rest are  urlLink here .  Enjoy..I'm going to crash now.
