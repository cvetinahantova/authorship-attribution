OTN (Obligatory Technology Note):    *Web Hosting* - As someone owns a few domains, who doesn't want to pay a lot for hosting, and who wants CF hosting, I recommend   urlLink HostingDataCenter  .  (Get a reseller account !)  If you want to know more about the hosting field in general (e.g. experiences, tech issues, etc.) see  urlLink WebHostingTalk .
