So tragic!  Dead at 25!  That will keep me ever mindful of divine grace, grateful for the opportunity to walk in divine light, grateful for the chance to breathe deep again, seeking understanding, connection and healing in every step.  Life can be so deadening if you've never been taught how to look up into the light of the soul.  I'm learning a series of techniques and I'm applying them daily.  I'm not locked into a routine, but I routinely remind myself to allow for time to practice and I find the time.  Meditation is beginning to free me, deep devotion will eventually free me completely.  I want only to know divine will.
