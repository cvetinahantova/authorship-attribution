Hmm... something past my mind today, I guess friends have a little criteria within. Its like, when ya wanna comment on something about ya best friend, but just see no chance to just intervene at all. For the first time in so long, Alvin and I just gave a raised eye-brow to each other. Well I'm giving him his space with his partner that is. I've got no right to say "hey! Ya gotta be with me." And ya know that feeling ya have inside when ya see someone else doing it but not ya? Sometimes it makes me wanna find one too. But I guess its just a part and puzzle of friendship.    Anyway Floorball was yet again amazing. Our team won like 10 to 0 or even more than 10, we lost count. Lol. One rule's proven, anything can be done if ya know it can be done. So yeah I felt so good inside. Hope I can maintain my standard anywhere else. Well Had a E-maths mock paper today...man it was tough, but I guess I can do pretty well as I know I've given my best. So I got home after a long day.. had to meet Alicia, but ended up being just with the pup. Hmm...she must have been coupped up by something... ah well... life goes on...
