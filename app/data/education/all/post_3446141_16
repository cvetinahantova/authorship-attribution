Ok so I have decided this, Fast Food is the DEVIL.  Why is it that everyday at lunch I end up rushed and have to stop at some junk food place?  I hate it. Today's fast food choice Chick-fil-a. BLAH. And why is it that it can taste so good and make me feel disgusting at the same time.  This is why I have come this realization!!  No more!  Has anyone seen that documentary that was made about fast food?  I haven't seen it, I don't know if it's out yet or not, but I read about it on the MSN home page a couple of days ago.  And needless to say it was shocking.  I mean we all know that "yeah if you eat fast food all the freakin time your gonna gain weight", but it was horrifying all the shit it does to you body along with that.  I mean not that any of this was a shock; I've been told it all before.  And I obviously continued to eat my fast food.  But what they did in the documentary is have the filmmaker eat fast food and only fast food for like a month or something, and if he was asked if he wanted to super size he has to say yes!  I'm talkin breakfast, lunch and dinner!!! Anyway here is a quote from the article:  "When he began his McDonaldâ€™s binge, he weighed 185 pounds. He ballooned to 210 pounds by the end. His cholesterol rose by 60 points."  Isn't that gross!  So I am putting an end to fast food eating..........well not an "end" I will still have the occasional burger but by occasional I mean like once a month! LOL!  But fuh reals, Who is with me??  PS: I love Alltel!!  They are AWESOME!
