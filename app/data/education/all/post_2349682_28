I feel so unworthy at times to even call your name You went through so much suffered and died, and even if it ws only me you still would make that choice Why do I worship? Because you are my everything,  you are the only one who shows what unconditional love is all about. You are the only one who would willingly die for me. If that isn't deserving of worship I don't know what  is.
