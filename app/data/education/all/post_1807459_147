It is pretty cool to have internet at work.  It's raining again today.  What the hell is wrong with the weather in this country.  I should have tomorrow off so I'm looking forward to that.  Time off is pretty awesome.  No real plans.  It'll probably rain at the rate things have been going.  I should hook up with some of the guys tonight for what should be a pretty low key night out.  This is good b/c I was pretty hardcore on the weekend and for whatever reason I still can't seem to get a great night's sleep.   Atlanta Braves baseball is sucking it up.  I know it's still early in the season but it looks like the run might be over.  This is a little painful but I'm sure I'll survive.  Hopefully they'll be able to get themselves together and pull out of it.   WABA is still closed and I'm not sure if it'll reopen or not.  This is a pretty sad deal to me.  I should be eating some steamed pork tonight with Fenton so hopefully this will do me well.  He claims to have found the place with the best kimchi.  I'm a little skeptical but we'll see.   I need to some get some prescription sunglasses before I head off a traveling.
