I haven't been on much, haven't really ahd time.    Yesterday, our water pump quit working.  My dad owns a small trailer park, and it is on the same well and pump that we are, so when the water quits working, it affects 5 families.  Not a good thing.  We spent most of the day, into the evening getting it fixed, while that was going on, I was trying to fix my computer.  It had suddenly started downloading programs I had never seen before, and all kinds of stuff, so I had to do lots and lots of scans and fixes to get it to working right.    AND, while trying to figure out what was wrong with the water, the electrician realizes that our circuit breakers keep tripping.  So he is worried that our house is going to burn down.  When we find out later the Air Conditioner is too strong for the outlets in our house, the house is old, so it wasn't wired to support the load of a air conditioner.  So now, we have to keep everything on that side of the house off, when the air is on.  Needless to say, I was stressed.    Many times I found myself in the living room, sitting in a chair, with my head in my hands praying.    Its all better now, thank God.
