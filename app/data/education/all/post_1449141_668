She said today: "President Bush waged war on the pretext of disarming Iraq, whose nuclear weapons program in fact had been dismantled by 1995. Now at the United Nations, where governments are meeting about the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the United States is claiming that 'the NPT does not prohibit the nuclear weapons states from modernizing their nuclear forces while they possess nuclear weapons.... It would be a novel interpretation of the NPT to assert that conceptual work on a "Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator" or other new weapons designs is problematic under the NPT.' But the treaty requires 'negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date.' More than 30 years after the NPT became law, and 15 years after the Berlin Wall came down, the U.S. position exemplifies bad faith, and is seen that way by most of the world. This does not bode well for the viability of the nonproliferation regime."
