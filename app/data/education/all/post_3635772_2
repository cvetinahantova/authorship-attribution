today is the last time i would get to see a co-worker of mine.  and for that occassion, i did a good deed for her - i brought her out of school, during school hours, despite my meeting-packed hectic schedule today, without asking permission or approval from any authority, just so that she can go to the briefing that she would need for tomorrow.  bukas na kasi ang lipad nya eh.  she's bound for Katar and she plans to work there for two years.  so in effect, today would be the last time i get to see her.  ewan ko ba what came over me to do such a stupid act.  it's something like texting someone the whole lyrics of a song just because she needed to sing it.  sigh. the stupid things i do just because i care.  minsan nga feeling ko na nililigawan ko na ang babae without intending to dahil masyadong caring ang dating ko.  but then again, this was THE LAST.  just like another co-worker that abruptly left recently.       even though medyo di kami on good terms (syempre sasabihin ko fault nya yun), i had to find the guts to make-up with her and to get across that i care for her.    medyo mushy nga ang dating para sa akin eh pero she didn't find it so.  i guess i'm not really that used to showing my feelings kaya any miniscule ooey-gooey feeling that i show i already consider to be mushy.  ewan ko ba.  i'm trying to uncover all of my hang-ups pa eh.  and trying to learn in the process.
