Hey guys  I'm concerned, as I hope you all are, with staying in touch after graduation.  This got me thinking that we could start a blog intended mostly for each other.  The reasons to do this are many:  1)  posting on a blog is only slightly more complicated than writing an email, and only so when you want to include a picture or link.  Either way, it only took me about ten minutes to figure it all out.    2)  We can stay in touch together, as a group.  Think of it as a virtual Mill.  I think there's less pressure but more incentive to stay in touch this way.  If there are enough of us, pressure is considerably diluted; no one has to post with any particular frequency.  3)  I will do all the administrative work.  All you have to do is post.   5)  Invite anyone else who you'd think should be involved (and please explain that I didn't email them at first not because I meant to, but because these were the addresses in my contact folder).  6)  If you're unsure, just sign on.  You're not really committing to anything except for future options.    I think this will be great, but only if you guys think it will be great.  Let me know.  I'll get started on it right away, this email will be the first post.
