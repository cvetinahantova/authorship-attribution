Aaarg!!! The sister of my friend caled this morning. His brother was my friend since elementary..and he's also getting married this September. Hay naku, I'm thinking of adding her and her parents in my guestlist..close naman ako sa kanla. Kaya lang, my guestlist is starting to balloon na... oh no!!!  Went to SnR at the Fort to eat lunch. Pizza!!! Saw Reema Changco (just had to text Polgas) with Ryan Eigenmann. Then we went to Megamall to change credit card payment option in Family First. Then finally bought grocery for Joey's baked mussels.  As soon as we got to Joey's, we wet straight to their unit to prepare the mussels. Then we brought it to the office. Alang oven dun so microwave nalang. Hahahaha.  Okay na din. Masarap pa rin...Met Jeng, wife of Brian. Andun din si Ming. Dumating si tei, with her police bf, Joshue and his friend, and Bobby.  Umiral na naman yung 3rd eye ko sa party ni Joey. At 2am, we were in the sala near the balcony. Myk and his friends were talking about their Bicol trip xxx years ago. It was about the white lady they saw that gave them a warning about a truck stopped in front. Then suddenly, this Joey shout towards me. The moment I shouted because of the shock, I saw a woman standing behind him in the balcony. I swear my heartbeat stopped. Myk tried to hug me but I ran to the washroom. I think I stayed for like 20 minutes in the washroom. I couldn't stop crying. Finally let Myk in. he gave me a hug and then I told him. when we went out, I went straight to Myk's office to get my things. He  was the one who told them that I saw someone. That was the same "person" I saw beside Myk in his office months earlier. Haaay.. aside from the fact na I wanted to stranggle Joey for doing that, I really got scared. I think it was the first time Myk saw me like that. Namutla daw ako and he literally saw fear in my eyes daw.
