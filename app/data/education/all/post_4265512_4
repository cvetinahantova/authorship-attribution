mr dew, thanks for ur comment. tho i dunno who u r. well i think 3d stuffs are cool, but it's just tt the 3d max prog is not a very gd one. mine really gave me lotsa probs too.it slows down my whole system, corrupts my files,well,in simple terms,it's really lousy and troublesome...sighs..  on sunday i was supposed to be the backup singer,but i overslept. not my fault,but my alarm clock went faulty.dad called me at 10am..when i woke up,i realised tt my alarm clock was not even 8am,and the alarm button was still on. needles weren't moving at all...i dunno wat's happening to my alarm clock,it doesn't seem like the batt went flat,becoz until now..the needles are still ticking.it is only when i set the alarm,then the needles will stop moving..well,i guess it's time for it to go..it has served me faithfully for a couple of years..  then i went church n came back ard 4 plus. started doing morg proj at 5pm. spent 5hrs on it!    after i did morg,i did OC ppt slides.did for pretty long,then i burned jay's cd for mel.first time i spent 12 solid hrs on the com! from 5pm right up to 5am!
