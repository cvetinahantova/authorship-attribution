urlLink Amazon.com: DVD: Buffy The Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season (2001)  Another season of Buffy is available on DVD.  Season 6 had the famous "Buffy the Musical" episode.  Buffy also came back from the dead.  Her digging out of her grave gave me the spooks.    This show is all about information literacy.  One character is a librarian and research in the library and on the Web is featured repeatedly.   Vampire lovers and the transcendent blondes ain't for everyone but I love Buffy.  (An early article on Buffy and information literacy was written by DeCandido, Graceanne A. "Bibliographic Good vs. Evil in Buffy the Vampire Slayer." American Libraries (September 1999): 44-47.)
