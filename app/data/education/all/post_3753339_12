Well, my exercising this week was terrible, because I had lots to do, it was quite warm for most of the week, and I had a couple of major down days.  However, my eating was also not as disastrous as it was last week--I went a little nutty on cookies on Saturday-Sunday-something (it was so late and I was so down I really didn't know or care what day it was).  I need to start exercising and continuing the decent and moderate eating habits.   35/44
