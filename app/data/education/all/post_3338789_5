Hooray! It's Friday!  At least for me.  Today was my last day of the week I had any plans. On the REAL Friday they are coming to replace a few things at the house but not until 1pm so I can at least sleep in all I want.  This whole getting up at 7am thing sucks. Bad.  My class is so far quite easy, though I may change my mind after the first test.  We have to write an 8-10 page paper and do a presentation in class-the ONE THING I didn't want to do.  Yesterday I went up to Stritch to register for my fall class (that ONE class will cost me almost 1500 bucks! GAH!).  It was a pleasant trip until the ride home hit a ONE HOUR delay because a semi driver had an asthma attack and flipped his truck on the highway...Oops.  I could've gone a different way but I had no other plans for the day and the morbid curiosity bug hit me...so I stayed and got to see the show first hand. Luckily, the driver was fine after a short trip to the hospital to treat his asthma.  Not much else to report.  I have been taking naps every day for the last week...mmm...naps. :)  My back has gotten worse but better-more spots showed up but they're not as red and not quite as itchy and painful now... I hope they go away soon. I've heard every diagnosis from poison ivy/oak to shingles. Who knows!   urlLink My back...2 days ago (it's a bit better now)   the PW is Gen if it won't let you in.  WAHA. :)
