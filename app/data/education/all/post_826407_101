God Reaches Out...  If I had to summarize the message of my faith into a few words I could do a lot worse than this.  The story we tell is one of a God who is never content to stay alone, away from his people but who does all he can to reach us, to get through to us, to take hold of us.   God stretches out and crosses the divide between eternity and finite time.  He reaches out and beckons to us from the Heavens. "Come, be with me."  This, I believe is the true story, and within this narrative Christmas makes sense.  It is just one more example of God stretching, God reaching out into Human darkness and changing. This time his reach is into the womb, into Human form.   Later God will stretch again and as he does he will cry out and die.  And still he goes on reaching, beckoning, searching, calling.  Do I listen, do I respond to his stretch and allow his embrace or do I ignore and carry on remaining in shadows?  "when you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears  when you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears  and I've held your hand through all of these years"   "Evanescence - My immortal"
