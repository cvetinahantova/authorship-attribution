Hmmm...yesterday was awesome. You know what i did in the morning as i already posted it, but after that was great. Janelle picked me up around 11 and we went to her house so her family could change clothes (they were at church). Then we picked up her mammy and we went to the huge Cabelas store. The drive is about an hour long. We got there and this place was packed. The parking lot is almost as big as hershey parks parking lot. We were there for awhile, theres so much to see and do there. We didn't buy alot of stuff, her youngest sister got a shirt, her dad got some fishing stuff, and i got a slingshot and 3000 bb's. We ate in cabelas (they have there own restaurant in their store), its called Cabelas Campfire. We all ate there and we left cabelas around 5. We got home and janelle, her sister melanie, and I went downstairs and watched the secret window. We came back up after the movie and watched some old famliy movies of X-mas 94 and 95. Around 9 her mom took me home. On the way home we had to stop at the elementary school and check things with her mammy. (She is Mrs. Greene the janitor at the elementry!) We walked around inside the school for a half hour, the place looks so small, the halls downstairs are so small, there not wide like high school. I got home around 9:30 i guess and went to bed around 10:30. I went to football this morning and now Im here. Im gonna be chillin' with janelle here all day, so yea, update tonight!
