Florece was nice but boring, ther was lots to see and lots of shopping, but being on a shoestring budget, shopping was not something I was lookoing for. The food was fairly  mediocre as well. so far as a tourists spot, I wouldn't recommend going for long, but was nice to see David, and a few other works of art be the well known father of david, but all in all I would have been happier either way.
