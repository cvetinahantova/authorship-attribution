Today    while I was at bible study I received a phone call from my boss. I guess it was meant for me to get the call because I always turn off my phone during bible study but this time eventhough I thought I did turn it off it was not turned off. I ran outside the room as I saw her name on my phone screen but by the time I got through all the people (I was packed today!) It was too late and I got a voice message. It was my future boss telling me that everything went well and that tomorrow I have to go to the district and sign my   CONTRACT!!    urlLink  I am so greatful for God's blessing. He truly is showing me how much he loves me, not only by this job but by what he has been revealing and speaking into my heart. God is the only one that will truly fulfill me. I have to rest in that!     I met with the intern coordinator at our school to figure out what the requirements are and what paper work needed to be filled out to get the intern credential. She was very helpful. She also told us that we will be getting a stippened (extra money for supplies and stuff) and we will get three subbing days free which they will pay for and we will be getting some new materials. That was exciting because it was unexpected and because being that I will be a new teacher I need all the help I can get financially because I have to buy a lot of things.      Tonight's college group was good  .  We talked about sex and how we should glorify God with our bodies. The pastor pointed out some great scriptures and consequences and gave practical ways to deal with this issue and society. Usually after college group we hang out. We got invited to go with Andy and Miguel to In N Out but I decided to skip it because I had to come home and get ready for tomorrow. I am suppose to meet my friend at the gym at 5:45am to take a bycling aerobics class. I missed being around the CG group because last week I missed everything since I was hanging out with my cousin and family.      This weekend is going to be fun!    On Friday a whole bunch of us are going to get together at PUSH (praying until something happens) night. Which is a time where people just come together and pray at 6:30pm from there we are heading out to the long beach center to watch  "Bourne Supremacy" at 10pm we decided to watch a late movie because many people work and we wanted as many people to go. Saturday we are having a college bonfire. I am excited because I love being at the beach and the one they had planned before got cancelled. On Sunday the whole church is having a beach party.      I'm just trying to take it day by day.    Each day I pray for God's grace, patience, and joy. Thanks to all those of you who have been encouraging me in different ways.     I   am trying to walk by faith not by sight   .   I am anxious to see God move and see how he will use the situations I am going through.                   urlLink
