Last night I was able to spend some time with a good friend. We got pedicures, had dinner, and walked around the mall for a little while. It was GREAT to get to spend time with Leana...she knows me so well! Today I will be helping Pammie make Cora's baby announcements. Carrie will be stopping by to see baby Cora and show us her RING! Now that I think of it, I don't have anything BIG to show my friends...no ring...and definitely no baby! Maybe I should bring the new family dog Monty...
