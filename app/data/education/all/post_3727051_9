The weekend is over.  All in all, it was a good one!  Saturday, the boy child and I went to town to purchase hubby's birthday gifts.  We ended up with a new self-propelled lawn mower, a Char-broil grill, and a really cool reclining lawn chair.  Sunday, we presented the gifts (he loved them!!!) and went to town to the grocery store and spent the whole day together, playing croquet, barbecuing, swimming, and of course, lighting fireworks.  Everone still has all their fingers, and nothing burned down.  Now, it's back to work, luckily we only have a 3 day week.  Friday off means another long weekend !   I asked hubby  this morning if he might go to a meeting today; he got a little distant.  I also asked him if he might call the substance abuse counselor.  I'm really worried that he won't go through with these things, no matter what his intentions.  Then I worry whether or not I should be mentioning meetings and appointments to him, I don't want to be pushy, but I do want it to be done.    I guess what I need to do is keep praying, praying, praying.  I have to get over my insecurities about the whole situation, and keep pointing him in the right direction giving him all the encouragement I can.    Just keep on pluggin' away...
