Today was a very good day.  Work went quite well.  I had a meeting this morning where I got to help plan RA training (I *love* training!), and this afternoon, Alicia, Rose, and I sat around and talked for an hour while the rest of the building was over at a planning meeting.  We aren't sure what they were planning, but we had a great time making our own plans while they were gone.  lol.  Anyway, in addition to that, it was also quite a productive day.  I managed to book a comedian for orientation, and a musical comedian for later in the semester.  All that, and my boss told me that the way things are going, he may be able to justify making my position full time come fall.  Go me!  That was pretty much it for today's excitement.  Tonight's fun is going to consist of bed and the new book that I'm reading.  Tomorrow, Tim and I are getting together for lunch, and then I'm heading to the mall to catch "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azcaban."  Sounds like a fun-filled day to me!  :-)
