When I said I was teaching English in Madrid, I wasn't lying.  But it's not the conventional kind of teaching that you would think of when someone says "  Hey, I'm a teacher.  "  My classrooms are far from the classrooms we had when we were little runts in highschool pretending to learn Spanish.  Large, bulletin board infested rooms with a haze of chalk dust in the air.  No.  My classrooms are personal offices and conference rooms.  Since all of my students are professional business-people, I go to them, they don't come to me.  So I get to know quite alot of Madrid en-route to these business'.  Or, at least I get to know the metrolines rather well, and can now remember if I've been in a subway car based on the fine graffiti you can find within them.   So, needless to say, I spend about as much time commuting between offices as I do teaching in them.   And that gives me  alot  of time to stare blankly into thin air.  Not wanting to watch my brain atrophy into a lump of pudding, I've started to engage in the fine art of people-watching. So... I'll use this fine blog-space to publish all the random not-so-deep thoughts that pass through my dome in these times of quiet meditation.  God Bless you for actually reading this...
