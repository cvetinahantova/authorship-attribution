Mmmm. Parties. Mmmm. Boys. Mmmm. Boys at parties... I did it! I pulled! His name is Chris and he's a friend of Debbs's boyfriend Matt; he lives in Four Oaks and goes to Arthur Terry, and he's doing History, Psychology, English Lit and... wait for it... RS! He went to V last year, he likes Muse and the Chilis; he's tall, skinny, brown, floppy almost-emo hair with blonde highlights and a sort of goatee (but it's not rank, and it didn't get in the way ;o)), but best of all, he wears Chucks! I was in the kitchen and he came in and somehow we ended up with our arms around each other, then Laura came in and said "kiss him" so I gave him a kiss on the cheek, so Laura got irritated and went to get more drinks for us, leaving me and he alone in the kitchen... needless to say, by the time Laura returned we didn't need the drinks ;o)   The rest I can't be bothered to relate in much detail. We talked a lot and kissed a lot, then as he left he told me it was "delightful" to meet me (great!) and I got his number... :o)  So suddenly my life is good. And it's not just good, it's really good. I'm not "not unhappy", I'm actually really happy. I have purpose and direction when it comes to work and love, and I'm calm and content. Of course, there's always that nagging feeling in the back of my head: "don't get too comfortable or pleased with yourself; it could all go wrong as soon as it all went right", so I'm being careful. I'm not imagining scenarios between me and Chris of us visiting each other at University, or having some sort of wonderful, magical relationship. But I would really like to see him again, because he was really nice- he got my sense of humour, he's intelligent and he wears the  best  shoes... :o)   DAY COUNT  Results Day: 4 JYF: 5 Hundred Reasons: 7 Maroon 5: 8  Ceff x   Just a dream, just an ordinary dream, as I wake in bed, and the boy, just an ordinary boy, was it all in my head?
