Ahh Tuesday... 3rd day of the week. Approx 5 more days till school starts. Im not lookin forward to it very much. Kinda dreading it. See Mazura's face, the homework and the exams. Sigh...Life... Why does it have to be so cmplicated? Why cant it just be simple? War goin on, men raping women, ppl killing each other, children suffering from various diseases, and issues of racism going around...And Malaysia is supposed to be a multi-racial commmunity.. All these stuff..for what? Aih..humankind.. We are supposed to be brothers and sisters taking care of each other. Not victimizing each other for our own sake. Anyways, im gona add another section called 'picture of the moment'. Everytime i blog, i will change te pic. It can be any pic. Celebs, school, friends, family, Me hehe.., groups, bands...Jus anything. Well gtg now.. Wana go do some channel surfing..hehe.. Fook out
