I cannot believe school is starting.  Where did my summer go?  I swear... if I ever met someone who seriously--- SERIOUSLY mentioned the phrase "Must be nice to have your summers off" to me..... I think I would want to just kick them right on the hiney.  Sometimes I think it will be a relief when the kids actually get there because I will be able to teach.  Enough about school.  Naaaaaaaa..... nevermind... My brain is tired.  I think I'm going to go to the dollar movie theater.  No thinking involved :)
