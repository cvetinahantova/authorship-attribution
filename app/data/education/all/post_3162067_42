And it's another nice and sunny day. I am getting a tan, which is always a novel experience for me. Sadly, the countdown to going back to work has begun: just four more days of freedom. However, as this is to be my last half term as a teacher, I am not going to let the job piss me off any more. Yesterday I applied for 3 jobs and today I have another 2 to apply for. It would be nice to be called to interview this time! One of the jobs I'm applying for I'm really hopeful about. One thing has cropped up into my mind, which concerns me. My back. Over the last few days my back has been killing me. It feels like the bottom few vertebrae have completely fused together (which, according to my doctor, they probably have) and I can't bend over without intense agony. Spent most of yesterday curled up on the sofa. This does worry me: as a librarian I will be required to do some book lifting from time to time. Not sure what to do about that. Having a bit of a moral dilemma: own up about my back problem and I'm reducing my chances of getting a job. Don't own up and I could end up doing more damage. Really bad period pains (sorry dad, skip to the next paragraph if you're reading this). Yesterday they were so intense that I collapsed on the way home from town: my legs just gave way under me. Plus I have toothache, which is very unfair considering I have now virtually eliminated sugar from my diet. Yesterday I made a t-shirt. It has a cartoon picture of Stitch (my rat) on the front with the words: Snitch for President. Snitch is her pseudonym in my book, which is going quite well at the moment. I have nearly finished the 5th story: halfway there. I have plans to write a sequel: where Snitch attempts to take over the world. It's the sort of thing that she would do. Right, let's get these other blooming job applications sorted. Then I'm going to clean the house and do some marking (sob sob sob).
