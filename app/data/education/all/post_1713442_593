urlLink Enrollment Trends in Community Colleges. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Hans A. Andrews.    From the ERIC Digest:  Community colleges are rapidly adapting their policies, procedures and services to accommodate new and growing groups of students. New community college student enrollment groups include (1) dual-credit and dual-enrollment students taking college courses during their last two years of high school; (2) reverse transfer students, both those who have attended a senior college without completing a degree, and those who have completed one or more degrees; and (3) students needing or wishing to obtain job retraining. Serving these students offers community colleges a way to meaningfully address some major educational and employment concerns that have arisen today.   This digest presents key information and current research on these three expanding categories of students enrolling in American community colleges at the beginning of the 21st century.
