Just blogging along, waiting for the girls to awaken.  They're both so cute as they sleep, gathering energy for the day.  Yesterday we went to the carnival - lots of fun rides, stuffed animals, snow cones, chicken tacos, and sunshine.  The carnis were another sight to reminisce on.  Those carnivals that blew through Salinas when I was a kid had some questionable characters working the sidelines.  Yesterday one ride operator offered me 20 tickets for $10, but "don't tell anyone, ok?"...  Trying to scam a buck for his habit, I suppose.  Another young kid offered to give us free rides if we came back later.  He said he just appreciated us listening to him tell his story about getting in a fight with a Mexican while we rode the ride.  Apparently he had hurt his leg and needed some attention.  His coworkers were just a bunch of "druggies and users" and were "very immature for their ages".  I understand...  Time to sign off and surf up on some foundation info...the web is great!
