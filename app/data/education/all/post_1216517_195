i love the children, the happiness here.  i made a new friend, rosa.  i think she's about 10 years old and sells bread on the street.  sh'e funny.  she told me that my breath smelled like beer (if that gives you any indication on how well my trip is going).  rosa's great, but i'm beginning to question how far our relationship extents beyond the transaction of baked goods.
