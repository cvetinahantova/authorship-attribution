ODD SCENES  I was driving to the library on Valentine's day.  At a stop light a noticed a teenage boy crossing the street.  He was dressed like a skater and carrying a boquet of flowers.  I thought, "Huh, that's cool.  I wonder who he's going to give those to."   I look down the street and there was a fire truck and ambulance, lights flashing, parked in front of a high-rise retirement community building.  "Shoot. Happy valentine's day,"  I thought. I noticed the kid crossing the street and walking into that same building as an elderly person was being wheeled out off and then loaded into the ambulance. odd.  One of the most bizare scenes for me though was on 9-11.  I was woke up, saw one of the towers fall.  I was totally freaking out.  Jesse and I decided to go buy Bob Dylan's new cd, (Love and Theft) that was released that day, to get our minds off everything.  We walked into Wal-Mart and there was a tv in the entryway showing all the distruction occuring in NYC.  Near the TV was an in-store McDonald's with a bench on which sat a life-size plastic Ronald McDonald.  A lady was sitting on the bench next to Ronald watching the 9-11 stuff on the tv.  The Ronald figure had his arm on the bench around the lady.  It appeared as if he was comforting her or something.  It was flat out freaky, man.  Anyway, I have president's day off.  I'm going to celebrate the presidents and go surfing in their honor.  word.
