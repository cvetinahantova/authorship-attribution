For the first time, as far as I can recall, I woke up late for class, and I mean REALLY late.      It's still bothering me, how did I ever manage to wake up at 9.50a.m when my class starts at 9a.m?       It's not like I slept late or what, I was already in bed at 11p.m last night!!      But fortunately my lecturer didn't get angry at me. She was actually QUITE shock seeing me knocking at the door with my uncombed hair at 10.15a.m in the morning.      Well, better late than never isn't?       3 more weeks before I leave for Korea.      I've been unconscience of the passing time. It's hard to imagine that I've been here for nearly 3 months.      What have I accomplish?      I didn't do my maths revision well enough and I don't think I did it well during the test just now. It's too late for me to do anything.       But, there's still my Korean language exam next week. Hopefully I'll do well in it.
