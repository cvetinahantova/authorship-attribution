I'm working on my portfolio web page.  I wanted a link to my blogg, but I forgot the address.  Since I had to visit my sitre, I might as well write something.  Cooked stir-fdry today.  It didn't get as involved as I thought.  It was neat, (mostly) clean, and painless.  I love that in a meal.  I cooked enough for two days, so we'll see how long it lasts.    For breakfast I ate the last two slices of leftover pizza.  It was good.  The crust was a little tough as I mic'ed it too long.  Later on I have to get my cat some food, as he is already out of the bag I bought a couple of weeks ago.    It's obnoxiously hot outside, but I gotta get stuff done, then I gotta take some asprin 'cause my head's hurtin' somthing fierce.     Chill, Y'all     Album of the Week:   "Secrets" By Toni Braxton.  Why?  Because it's her best work.  There are a lot of great songs on there, and the way I'm playing the CD, you'd think I never heard the songs before.  LOL.  Seriously, Toni lays down a lot of hot tracks on this CD, and she has a great voice.  The qualty of music, lyrics, and voice are the best.
