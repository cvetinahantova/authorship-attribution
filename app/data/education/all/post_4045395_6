Given any thought to the idea that all information, no matter the source or the message, is completely meaningless until it is needed or questioned by someone (or thing) of intellegence? So, despite all the import of being a librarian and harboring information, if no one is there to read it - does it exist?  When we have been wiped from this planet, like so many small bacterium on a recently cleaned surface, what will it all add to? Who will care and to what end will its existence come? What medium is there that will stand the test of time, forever?   Even though we might find artifacts of times and civilisations long gone, what do we know of them? Would they find comfort in the things we know of them? Truly doubtful. Especially given that there are civilisation like the Nazca for which we truly know nothing about.   Oh yes, we can use modern anthropoligical methods to hypothesize that this piece of pottery was for water. Or, that blanket with small knitted people marching around the outside edge like an army of ants singularly going nowhere, yet intricate enough that each minuscule person is individual from the rest - was a death shroud.   Its easy to imagine that all that the people had become is small recompense for the lives they actually lived, the challenges overcome, the mysteries they knew as common knowlege.   Weep for the passage of time, for no one is immune, and all will fall to her beauty.  Saying so, does this mean that too that information can be true and still be wrong? Is it nihilistic to say that all study, no matter how virtuous in helping our race is useless? How far can it go?   Soy nada, tengo nada. Usted es nada, somos nada. Nada, nada, nada.  Journeyman
