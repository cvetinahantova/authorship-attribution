We are officially on a much needed vacation.  It is so cold here and only going to get colder.  We are in northern Wisconsin and from Fort Worth, Texas, it is a world away.  Riding so far in the car with two teen and pre-teen boys plus a grown man is almost more than any woman should have to bear.  Between the farting and burping, there isn't much room for conversation.  It should prove to be a nice week away from the rat race that our lives have become.  My parents will be flying in to join us tomorrow and I really should be getting some sleep now.  I had good luck with scratch cards today, which I really never buy when at home, but on vacation, it seems that anything goes.  I won a total of 145.00 and spent only 22.00.   Not a bad profit.  Kind of makes up for having to sit with kids who burp and fart all day.....
