I've been reading a few tips from  urlLink Living Room   about  Blogging for lasting change   On the one hand it gives some great practical hints on how to make blogs more readable and accessible.    Its also got me thinking about my blogging activities and in particular  What do I blog for?   I know I started as an extension of my journal but since then have developed.  I want to comment on the things I see around me.  I want to add my voice to certain conversations and I want my site to be part of God's mission so I guess I do want readers to be affected.  All very grandiose stuff and I'm sure I miss the mark a bit.  But I have a quote on my dining room wall. "Hold on to your dreams, for if dreams die life is a broken winged bid that cannot fly" (Shakespeare, I think.  Well its definitely not the bible but it sounds oldish), Better to have a dream than not; so here's my question.   What do you blog for?
