hello,  well i'm back in bangkok at my favorite internet cafe thanking god that red  ants aren't running all over me.  that was one reason my emails from koh  chang were so short.  the other reason was that i didn't do anything other  than see the waterfall.  i love doing nothing.  i was basically laying  around a covered pavillion on coushions all week.  we played cards the  entire time. spades and chaw di de (i have no idea how to spell this one)   anyway...  chaw di de is a game from hong kong that vicky wong taught us to  play.  i taught everyone spades and between the two games we played several  rounds of cards.  i guess it might sound a little boring to some of ya'll  but it was exactly what i needed.  tonight i have a dinner cruise on the river.  it should be fun i'll let you  know the details tomorrow.  so now that i'm back i have to stop talking about taking thai lessons and  get started.  i've heard of a few people willing that are qualified so  monday i'm going to start calling.  wish me luck.  i know i need it.  love  ya.  jane  _________________________________________________________________ MSN Toolbar provides one-click access to Hotmail from any Web page Â FREE  download! http://toolbar.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200413ave/direct/01/
