One of those "not so talkative days"      Hmm. I was thinking I have my "not so talkative days". I guess today was one of them, and I imagine that tomorrow will be yet another one. I wonder why though. I just get to be like that on certain days and it just comes. I've been thinking about it, and I think it stems from me being extremely stressed. At the moment, the stress level is up there, probably sitting at a 8.5/10 mainly because of stuff I need to figure out for graduate school this fall. Other things are bugging me as well pertaining to people, and things I get myself involved with--too deeply.  I suppose that since my not so talkative day will be tomorrow, I may be able to get a lot of work done I hope. Need to meet with the other TA I work with. She and I need to figure out things for teaching next week.   Arrgh, I wait for that ONE day in my life when all things will be handled and I will sit stress free! Will I ever see a day?? Till then I'll have my not so talkative days when I am too stressed to talk, and when the sight of people annoys me. I suppose keeping quiet helps me get things done.
