We washed my car today. I have been a little apprehensive about doing it lately, because it has actually been raining here, and we SO totally need it! So, after putting it off for about a week, I decided to bite the bullet and take my chance. If it does rain, it's all good...it was clean for a little while.  Well, I say  we ... It was actually me doing the actual washing while Abbie ran through the water. The hose had a small hole in it, and I turned the hose so it would spray into the air. She  loved  it. And it didn't take quite as long to get the job done...no offense. I love her, but sometimes...  You all know what I mean.  We also made cookies today. The slice-and-bake kind. But, I have decided I don't like them because they're supposed to be sugar cookies and they taste like lemon.   Hello!   I think next time we will try to take the long way around (The circuitous route! Heh...shout out to you in Old Blue!) I mean try to make them from scratch. We'll see if it happens. I will probably give in and take the easy way out.  Now, I am ready for bed. I had a tiring day, even though I was able to take a nap! And, Abbie's nap was almost 3 hours long. Yay!  Oh, we are so excited that my little, big sis and niece will be visiting us next week. It will be a short and sweet visit, but, hey, it counts. For those of you who are interested... urlLink Coleygirl ! And for those of you who aren't, take F*ck-it-all. (Shout out to you-know-who...hehe!)  Oh, BTW, my tattoo is gone. :.( I guess I wash my hands too much. I don't know, though, if that is a bad thing. :)
