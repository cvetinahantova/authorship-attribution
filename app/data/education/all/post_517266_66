Indy - Just returned from Las Vegas for the last few days where I spent time with Ty Sells, Karl Anthony, Ray Lozano, Vic Perez, Nick Webb and Dave Myers.  It was a ton of fun as we always enjoy our annual time together.  I would write more, but what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  Yesterday, my MOTD was experiencing friend Dave Wilcox in concert and meeting his ten year old son, Nathan.  Today, the Colts were at home and confidently beat Atlanta.  SUperbowl, here we come!
