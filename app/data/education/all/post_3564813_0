Well, ya, its been a really long time since I last updated this blog. The reason being... I've been busy. Anyway, I'm at home alone at lunch, and have 6 minutes until I have to leave to go back to school.   CSI is one of the best TV shows on TV at the moment. That, and 8 Simple Rules, obviously. Anyway, the other spin off shows are not as good as just plain old CSI. I have a fiction book about it too which I've been reading this past week, and plan to read another one after I finish too. I wonder when that will be, sometime this week probably.  Our form tutor was away all last week and today too, so thats really good. She's so nasy, our previous form tutor went on maternity leave. When we had her we were 9TE, now since we have the new one, she changed us to 9WL! I have NEVER EVER signed a piece of paper with my name on saying that I am in WL, and I never will do! I always right TE on all of my work, and any forms that are handed in to teachers etc. LET THE POWER OF *insert something here* live on!   Anyway, thats about all I have got time for at the minute so see ya when I can next be bothered to write!
