----------------------------------------  PESCO!  --------------------- 2dae i woke up at 5am! Haha.. man.. so early.. Den met up wif yasir, faiz, alfiyan, izzat and iqbal at small mac at ard 6.45. Well.. den we boarded bus 19 on a 30mins journey 2 changi airport's cargo terminal. When we reached e bustop we were supposed 2 alight at, a security personel boarded e bus. I was like.. why is he staring at me? I raised my hand.. Den my finger came out. haha.. din notice which one.. e middle one almost seemed apparent! haha.. luckily i went down quickly. We den went 2 e guard room 2 exhange our ICs for a visitor's pass. Den we were screened and boarded e bus again 2 our workplace. When we arrived, we had 2 change 2 another pass! It stated..'CONTRACTOR'!!! haha.. Den we went in n change 2 our uniforms. It said 'Aircraft Appearance' at e back.. so chim! E cargo place was a hanger. There was a big top airplane dere. We were given a tin filled wif turpentine and a brush each. Although excited n curious on wad our job was gonna be like, we sat dere n waited for our assignment patiently. Den we were seperated. Me, alfiyan n izzat in one cargo cabin n e other 3 in another. Den we got 2 work. We were joined by an uncle and another kid abt our age. We started entusiasticly. We had 2 brush e metal parts of e cabin wif turpentine and wipe it clean. The place was like filled wif ball bearings, rollers and tracks! Well.. the young guy was like 4ever staring n daydreaming.. N he always went down 2 take a break. E uncle was like.. hey.. u missed a spot!! Grrr... In the end we did most of the job for e kid. Actually we didn't noe wad was next so we juz did our job quickly. We finished e whole cabin at ard 11. Den it was like.. erm.. wad do we do now? haha... we juz sat ard n acted like we were cleaning.. Lunch break!! haha.. our canteen was closed, so we went over 2 e next building's. On e way, we met up wif some of e other cleaners. E 'makciks' were like damn talkative! So 'BISING'! Talk Talk Talk! Den.. Laugh Laugh Laugh.. wah... cannot tahan dem sumtimes. We were told by e guard for dat building 2 take away our food n eat sumwhere else coz we were actually not allowed 2 enter. But we ate up dere anyway.. She was pissed at us of coz. Dunno how 2 eat 2moro!! Den we 'lepak' ard abit n went back 2 work. There was like nth left 2 do.. We finished e job 2 fast. We were given e whiole day, from 8am -3pm 2 clean one cabin. So we juz touched up abit, n of course e other kid was like Missing In Action AGAIN! Den when we were satisfied, we went down for a drink. But, alas, e supervisor spotted us n reprimanded us. He said "Awak nak kerja baik kerja betul2. Saper kasi awak turun dari cabin?! Awak baik jgn turun sampai kul 3. Last warning!" Sumtink like dat lah.. haha.. which means, why were we slacking in short. Haha.. soo we went back n stayed dere.. half asleep juz playing ard wif our brushes.. Time passed soo slowly den.. Den at ard 2.50 an old man went up n said.."Nanti Kul 3, awak bawak semua barang2 turun. Kul 3 ah" Haha.. he held up his 3 fingers.. n were like.. read btw e lines! Den went it was all over, we went home sleepy n tired.. $50 in e pocket already! haha.. 2moro another $50!! yeah!! ok.. wanna bath now.. Hang Loose!!!
