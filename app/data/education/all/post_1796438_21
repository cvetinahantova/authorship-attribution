I'm at school  I'm sitting in the library and I am sooooooooooooooooooooo bored. I just finished my Drama. I had to write something about a program so I did "The Mask of Zorro". You guys have to watch that! It is really cool!  Anyway...I'm at the top of my Chemistry Class (yay!) or should I saw that I'm sharing the top (*sad*). We're doing that worksheet that we got when Mr Smith was away (Advanced Chemisty). I've already done it cause, well, I did it last year.   I don't think I could say the same for Maths...I don't want to go into that.  I've got Drama next. The Drama teacher's okay and he talks to me...not sure if that's good or not but hey.  Media is A Grade BORING. We are doing BORING stuff.  In English we're reading the diary of Anne Frank...not bad but a bit depressing.  And last but not least...Geography...just don't get me started on that subject...(teacher treats females as dumb bum's but of course, that was before he met his match *evil giggles*)  Well, got to run to Drama because I'm nearly late...  ...I might catch the train home...  Anyway, I'll be talking alot because I have crap all to do here...BYE GUYS!!!  Wuv Morgan  P.S: My quote today is...not sure if I've done it so I will do two...okay!   "This is your test. Every path you have trod through wilderness through war has led to this road. The enemy will never let Aragorn come to the throne of Gondor.     AND   "It is time"   and it's time for me to go! BYE
