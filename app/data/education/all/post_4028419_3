I'm sitting here because I can't sleep.  I'm trying to find some kind of fancy words to say to start this, but I'm at a loss...that's funny, ME at a loss for words.  I guess I'm just thinking about the way I can get myself so excited about life one minute, but the next minute I'm worrying about what's the point of it all.  Will I ever be happy???  I know that the happiness is only going to start with me, but how am I supposed to be happy when it seems like the world is crumbling around me one day, but then I'm sitting on top of it the next.       Rambling, I know.  Let's see if I can head in some direction.  I've been dealing with someone I shouldn't be.  All things tell me that much; yet I can't let it go.  Did my self-esteem reach an all time low?!(didn't mean to rhyme) I'm not this person I'm allowing myself to be with him.  You know, part of me is scared to let go because I don't want HIM to be hurt...funny isn't it?  I do think I loved him, but I honestly don't see how it's going to work...yet I don't see how to let it go.  And if it's timing that's wrong, why can't I let it go and let the plan unfold if it's meant to be?  I really need to get it together.         My ex, J, has ticked me off again.  I just wonder if he gets off on saying things to hurt me.  It's funny how he acts as if I was more deeply involved in the relationship than he was--when his best friend told me that he was planning on proposing to me sixth months later (told her this a week before he broke it off).  Every time I express my feelings about something, being hurt or possibly uncomfortable going to his going away party because his new girlfriend might be there...he tells me "oh get over it!"  (she's not gonna be there, by the way, but still).  And I keep TELLING myself: you don't want to be with a guy like that ANYWAY!!! But it just seems like he was the one...but he couldn't be.  Reason tells me he couldn't be because "the one" would never, I mean NEVER, cut me in the places where he knows I'll bleed the most (figuratively speaking, of course).  J was good for my life because he showed me many things I never even knew I wanted in a man--but I think the biggest requirement I have to remember is to find a guy that takes care of my heart.  Love is all we have left at the end--and I don't want to be left empty handed.       I met a new friend tonight and enjoyed talking to him.  It was really easy.  I can tell within two minutes whether I'll feel like talking to someone more than once...we talked for about 2 hours.       I worry about myself sometimes.  Sometimes I feel like there's so much to look forward to; other times, I couldn't care less if my world ended right now.  Scary thing to live with, isn't it?
