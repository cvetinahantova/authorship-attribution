During the summer holiday, we teachers are reborn and able to enjoy some social gatherings. With the increased amount of spare time, I suddenly realized many of my friends are suffering some, to a different extent, imbalance in their lives. I named this disease 'defeated legs'.  Life is a table. A missing or shortened leg(s) surely don't harm your daily life. What I mean daily means day time. Under the bright sun, we are gladiators. We are strong enough to support the broken table. (Or are we too busy to pay attention to the broken leg?) Once you have your spare moment to calm down, relax and think (nights?), gosh, it's really something......  Usually we don't break the legs ourselves. Either the legs break themselves or are destroyed by some forces. The worst of all, the other legs declare war themselves. It's a bit tiring to decorate your table of life while at the same time, to maintain the legs.  Since we were kids, we were taught that your effort will be rewarded, or at least, appreciated. I don't care about the reward or appreciation. But please, don't simply come and hit my legs.  I remembered Georgia of Ally McBeal said,' What makes your problems bigger than others?'. This is the only button to switch off my emotion and put me into sleep.
