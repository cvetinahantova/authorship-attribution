In previous posts, although  I  find them interesting, I have noticed no comments.  As a writer, I get the impression you don't like them, so, as a writer, I'm going to change my style.  (The previous is garbage just so you know)    Summer    While thinking of you, with the summer dew catching the beautiful rays I think of us, together at last On one of these summer days  But you're never around, so I feel bound to simply thinking of you Thinking of us, together at last Just watching the morning dew  Finally one day, I decide to pray For you to come home to me I think he heard, for on the next day You came strolling home to me!  I'm a horrible poet...but I thought I would try something new!
