Have you ever been one of those people who feel that life is passing you by, but you don't really know if you want to reach out and grab hold.  I feel that way sometimes.  I wonder why anyone would want to be in that world, then I realize that I want to be part of everything, only I don't know how to start.  Don't ask me where this came from, just something I blankly wrote then sat back and said...Where the hell did that just come from.  I am suspicious that this blog will be like that a lot.
