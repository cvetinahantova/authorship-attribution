And the road goes ever on and on... Things are getting progressively better, although I can't believe there's still a week left at work before the holiday. I've been thinking about holidays; in a sense I have been spoiled by having so many breaks, and I don't know how I'll manage when I don't have so many. Ha! Poor me. But I strongly suspect that, having reclaimed my evenings and weekends, I won't need so many holidays to recover from term time. The great news is that Marcelle got my job yesterday. I'm am thrilled to bits for her: she deserves it. It's wonderful to know that she finally has a well-deserved permanent job. So reassuring. But it's a very final thing for me. It's sad to think that the department will go on without me; we've been such a team for the past 2 years, and I'm abandoning it. Dammit, I'm fed up of being tired all of the time. My quest to stop drinking caffeine has definitely contributed to this though. I just have to stick with it. Three more jobs to apply for next week, so that as definitely lifted my spirits. Now I will write a lesson for A-level.
