I don't see why you're telling me that I don't know any other religions.  My mother works with all of the world church denominations.  Through that, I've learned alot about those other religions.  It's makes sense to me and other that Christianity is my religion of choice.  I can sit and think about all the other religions, but to me there's no reason not to believe.  There's a reason that it's called faith; you put everything on the religion you believe in.  Nothing that is in the Bible has been disproven, that's just one thing that gives me a reason that I believe more fully than ever.  It only makes sense to believe what's in it.  People are different today, but the principles stated in the Bible are the same.  That's the beauty to it.  Everything still relates to the present day.  It's different from being a person who just believes in Jesus and someone who practices Christianity and has Jesus in their heart.  I think that's a difference when you say you were always part of the family.  Jesus says that if somebody is only half committed to him, it's just as bad as not being committed to him at all.  That's the family that I was praying that you and Spencer would come in to.  The one that's fully committed to the Lord.  I know that it takes time, but that's the family that I hope everybody becomes part of.  You never know when you'll die and stand in the face of God.  That's why it's just as important to practice now, instead of waiting until you become older and "settle down".
