Well, things seem to be going ok so far, but every now and then, I wonder just what I've gotten myself into. My teachers tell me not to worry, that they know I'll do just fine. We'll see...  Homework already! I've finished some of it as of right now, mainly because it involved internet research, and I was screwing around on the computer anyway. I'm so tired though, because my body does NOT want to keep getting up in the morning. Plus, I hurt everywhere from trucking all over campus with a huge bag o' books. I'm hoping I'll learn to adjust. Thankfully, all three of my classes today are in the same classroom. That's right. Not just in the same building, but in the same freaking ROOM! But, most of the theater majors are in the same boat as I am, so I see the same people all day. Kind of comforting, actually.  Met a girl named Katie today who treated me to lunch. She reminds me of me at her age (did I just say that??), except that she has a boyfriend and I was a boy-repeller for many years. Ok, maybe not, but dating was not high on my agenda. Actually, she reminds me a lot of Stephanie at that age too. Anyway, she took the same professor I have for Christian Home last semester and she says the course mainly turned out to be like sex ed. She said I should have no problem passing, being already married and all. :)  Question-- why do professors have to tell you about the freaking huge final project you'll eventually have to complete on the first day of class? My brain's about to explode just thinking about the various papers and presentations due by May.  Still, so far, so good.
