Have you noticed that some people settle for less,never hoping to rise above their current situation?  After hearing some people say how we should be grateful to have a job, and more along the same lines.  What I got from that was that if I'm working a dead-end job, I should be happy with that.  If I don't like the relationship I'm in, I should be happy I have someone I'm with.  What is that?  Nowhere did anyone mention that there is room for improvement.  That you don't have to settle.  Use the dead end job as a stepping stone.  If the relationship is not healthy, then leave.  I don't want to have crumbs on the table, I want a whole dinner.  I don't have a fixed "place" at the bottom of the barrell.  I should be rising to the top.  My goal is to remember that I must improve my living and finical status. I will grow, I shall rise, and take my place as a leader, not a follower.  We gotta do for ourselves, 'cause too many people are treating us like we're not supposed to have feelings or desire.  Besides, why waste God given talent and drive.
