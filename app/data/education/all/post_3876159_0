How hard is it? Please answer me that...why? why is it so difficult to get it right. I get it right over and over and over again. If I can do it, it just makes you look really bad because anybody should.   I say, "I would like a double espresso with some cream and 2 (sometimes 3) equal."  PERIOD. No secrets...no hidden agenda.. I promise I am not saying one thing and meaning another...THIS IS REALLY ALL I WANT.   I got it how I wanted it in Italy all the time. No questions or substitutes or misconceptions.   What do I get here at this wanna be cafe...a latte with a little espresso or an espresso with no sugar and definitely no sugar.    So what ...what did you say? If I like Italy so much ...what? Oh, why don't i just go back there? Oh, okay fine...I will...at least they can get a simple thing like a coffee right.
