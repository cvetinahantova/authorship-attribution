Yesterday was Helen and my 2nd anniversary.  Woo hoo!  We feel quite established and everything now.  I love you H!!!  Got given the new Elbow album as an anniversary present, its beautiful, trancendental, melencholy yet uplifting.  The last track, Grace under pressure, is an anthem of quiet defiance and hope.  Breathtaking stuff.
