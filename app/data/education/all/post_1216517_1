i've got the job.  i started yesterday.  it'll be interesting trying to learn everything.  it'll be cool though.    tip of the day: don't rub your eyes after handling  urlLink jalapeno peppers   i'm blind.  can't wait till st patty's day.  hope i have it off work.  my hours are 4-midnight, so that might suck.  no guiness.  :(
