Indianapolis - Having a great summer here in Indy.  Getting ready for the big wedding in August...went to Holiday World with my nieces in Southern Indiana and had a BLAST...swimming at the JCC...spending time with my Grandma who recently moved to town...and trying to get things done before the fall. So far, so good.
