The good, the bad, and the fugly   Ok, so I started downloading random stuff off Animesuki (see previous post,) and some of the shit they have is really cool! I got hooked on  Airmaster  - It's basically about this voluptuous high school chick that fights by spinning around in the air a lot (hence the name Airmaster,) and then there's this other chick with bouncy-bouncy, and then the first chick fights this Mexican Lucha Libre wrestler... The stuff is just so random that it's cool!  I also got an episode of  Hunter x Hunter , which picks up pretty close to where I stopped reading the manga, so that's cool too. And, and, and.... They have  Space Adventure Cobra !!! YES!!! *Happy Panda dance* So, I didn't get to play AD&D tonight because Morgan decided to tell everyone else but me that there wasn't going to be a game tonight. Sure, I knew that he was going home over the weekend, but I figured that he was leaving after the game and coming back on Sunday night or Monday. This thing with the game just ain't working, and I'm considering just not playing in it at all anymore.
