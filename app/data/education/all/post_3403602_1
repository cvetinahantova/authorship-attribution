Hello Hello. Yeah today was okay. I played drums. And I took my kitty to get her shots. Poor kitty. Shes in heat. Shes like "MEOW!! FUCK ME NOW!!!" Yeah. One of my friend is keeping me company. Shes great! Her name is Carrie. Shes my internet sex buddie. Hahaha. Yeah. I fell in luv in with this person. But I found out that one of my friends like them. They told me to send them a message to them saying they wanna get with em. I told them that I like them but they never told me they did too. Which sux. Cuz I wanna be with the person. God! Life sux. Oh and my kitty is getting fixed. Soo her and me are gonna be single. Great. We are both in heat. We need someone in our life. We are both trapped in the same room for ever. Not wanting to go out cuz no one ever askes. Oh well. Bye!!XoxO
