I think people fill up too much of their time. In the Bible we read about the characters meditating, watching their sheep, creating music, creating psalms....and the list goes on. Why do we fill up our whole days??????   If we get bored, why do we turn on the Television? What is the harm in just sitting....Maybe meditating on God or something else? Why do we only pray before meals or when it's time to go to bed? Of course, not everyone is guilty of this. I find myself, quite often, just sitting and praying for, sometimes, hours at a time. Who else in the world would give you His undivided attention for that long and just let you talk, or even ramble about the days happenings? Who else in the world would listen and be sympathetic???   The question may be raised here...."Is God sympathetic?" My answer to this would be, yes, I believe so. Jesus walked this earth and struggled thoughÂ everything that any other man struggled with. Just because he was perfect does not mean that he was not tempted, right? So God (Jesus) does know what we are going though. He sympathizes and empathizes with us. Wow.....a God who not only listens and hears our prayers, but also understands our struggles???? Mind numbing.
