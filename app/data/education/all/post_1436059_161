Whoa...what a  PSYCHO  day.  Mom is back from GERMANY, and she woke up at 4AM to make waffles. *sighs* Same old mom, yup yup. I was so exhausted from staying up so late on Friday night, having a meet on Saturday, and doing English projects on Sunday all day. So I was extremely tired. Extremely tired. People probably thought I was high or something, and I know Mr. Bright asked what I had had for a drink during lunch...NO!!! I am not a bad person...I WAS JUST TIRED!!!  So I get to CATN, and we change our class. I got my twelfth choice - Drafting/CAD. ARGH!!! If I don't get Baking/Pastry next rotation, I'm gonna be so mad...I'm definitely not going back to CATN next year.   P.E. made me even more tired. I got locked out, but Nancy let me back inside. Then Courtney Smith shoved Matt out the door and locked  him  out, and when she shoved him he smacked his elbow against the silver metal push bar that opens the door. His elbow was all bruised...LoL...I felt so bad for him...  Government was INCREDIBLY BORING. BAHHHH! We didn't have to take a test...(Happy Passover, everyone!)...Man, do you want to know how bored I was?!? Matt and I were so bored we planned our weddings, our future families, my future husband and his future wife...It was so scary when he told me who his wife would be...but then I laughed so hard! He is so funny...LoL.  Lunch was the usual. Gary sat with us, it was funny.  I went back upstairs after lunch and saw Keniesha and Andrea. Then I saw Kendra and Ryan. I was so tired by that point, I was on the verge of collapsing, I bet. I was so tired. Kendra and Ryan think I'm psycho. Wait...okay, Kendra knows I'm psycho. Nevermind. *yawns*  English was ESTUPIDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I got home and cleaned house. Go me.   I want a hug...*sighs and collapses*
