I finally connected with my son Jeremy online last night via Hello. We exchanged pictures and chatted for a period of time until someone needed to use the computer for work related issues.  I was so excited to be able to talk to Jeremy online.  We shared pictures and spoke about different things.  I also found out that Jeremy has a blog and so now I can keep up with what is going on as he writes in his blog.    You may be wondering what Hello is.  Hello is a chat client that allows you to share pictures with friends and chat at the same time.  You can find this client at  urlLink Share pictures with friends and family and chat at the same time
