As we are finding out around the world today that all societies are different yet   we are one in people  .  So again what is normality??  I deferred university to follow a hospitality industry career.  Five years of my life I spent trying to achieve the required goals set by management  and with all the effort I could muster I achieved goals and extended boundaries when I achieved these goals it was with sacrifice to me and benefits to others and ussually they set more goals.   What was the reward if any. Well I should have been able to see the lesson that was being presented.  I was learning, about others passions and indifference's.   What I was doing was starving my soul and my soul and direction. I was ingulfed in societies direction of material success to achieve something that didn't respect my humbleness and soul searching.   I found my self with a separat yarning a wanting to full fill something?? This separate heart beat that pounded inside me or energy within was telling me to move forward.   What and why I couldn't work out. yet there was an internal calling but it was becoming a scream. So I started to look and what I was looking for I didn't know I wanted that black board to show me.
