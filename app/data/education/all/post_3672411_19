After several huge hurdles I'm finally here in Japan.  First there was the $3,500 open-ended return ticket Dad had to buy because I went in on a tourist visa (my work visa finally arrived two days ago; now it's a matter of going down to the immigration office to get my passport stampled in Tokyo) and they require a return ticket to let you leave. The woman who arranged the ticket at the counter said it's fully refundable - I just have to go to the Air Canada counter in Narita and show them my passport and they'll refund it on the credit card.  I hope that goes smoothly. It had better, because there's no way we are spending $3,500.     There's Lucy the globetrotter on my sister's suitcase (she just got back from Chicago).     There I go!   urlLink Adventures with Air Canada   So after a 13 hour flight, I was off the plane with my luggage by 3:30 PM on the 13th. It turns out the other fellow they hired was in the seat right behind me on the plane. Peter was there to meet us and we couriered our luggage to the office (it arrived this morning all in tact).  They had a little arrival party for us at Christie's apartment (about eight other trainers plus foreign administrative staff all live in this complex) which was nice. I had this lemon-vodka drink that Tony gave me and a beer. After that much dehydration even *I* had the common sense to stop. I gave Peter's kiddies their presents (it turns out he has two daughters, and nary a son...I hope they can find a use for the long sleeved top anyway) who are adorable.  Today I managed to get extremely lost and got the tail end of the lunch that some colleagues arranged. It so happens that one of the people I asked for directions was a student of ours and walked me directly to the office. Score.  Just a note: the roads here are crazy. Sidewalks? What are sidewalks?      urlLink More pictures around the city are here .
