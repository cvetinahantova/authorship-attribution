i've been consumed by this war.  it's all pretty overwhelming.  i strongly support the liberation of the iraqi people.   today was a pretty sad day for the U.S.  Something like 10 soldiers taken as P.O.W.'s.  There are some pretty gruesome pictures of abuse to them. Through it all though, I wish I was over there fighting.  I'd be proud to serve and protect my country and take down Sadaam. none of the anti-war arguements seem valid to me.  sure, death and casulities are never good, but to see the images or iraqi's cheering and ripping down Sadaam's picture...that gives me goosebumps.  oh, and if you want and interesting view on current events, check out the  urlLink drudge report  if you haven't already.  it's got stuff like this...  "F�k Saddam. We�re taking him out," said President George W. Bush in March 2002, after poking his head into the office of National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, TIME reports.  funny.
