During lunch today I was in the car with my boss and two colleagues. My boss had some extra tickets to the SF Giants baseball game. I mentioned that I was interested in going to the game, so she asked if I would bring anyone with me. I said yes. She asked, "Significant other or girlfriend?"   "Yes, both."   She paused for a moment. "Are you trying to send me a secret message here? Are you trying to tell me something?"   "I don't know-- are you listening?"   Meanwhile, my colleagues and I are cracking up!   NR came to the rescue. "Yes, she is."   Boss: "Well, I just want you to know that I'm ok with that. You can be whoever you want to be." (a little defensively, I thought! as if she were trying to convince herself that she's accepting of diversity)  We'll see what happens next. I imagine she'll tell TJ's mom, which will open a whole new can of worms. TJ says she's ready for her mom to know, after all, we've dated for four years!
