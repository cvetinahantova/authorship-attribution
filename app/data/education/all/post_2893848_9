Most of you probably don't know this, but I am in love with Strong Bad. Who is Strong Bad, you ask? Quite simply, he is the awesomest guy in StrongBadia. To meet him, and see why Strong Bad has my heart, you must visit  urlLink wwww.homestarrunner.com  and check out the emails to Strong Bad. (Especially recommended: Dragon, English Paper, and Japanese Cartoon)  Strong Bad's own animated series, "Teen Girl Squad" (under 'toons,') is also highly recommended, and will give you further insight into the sensitive, mysterious, macho man that Strong Bad is. If not for Strong Bad -- and, in fact, the whole Homestarrunner gang -- I would be a much more productive and prolific writer than I am. And I thank them for that.
