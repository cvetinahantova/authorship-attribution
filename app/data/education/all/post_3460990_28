Today was my second day of summer school with children, and it was chaos. I knew that kids in summer school generally need extra help, and also might be behavior problems, but honestly, I was not prepared for what I experienced today. There was yelling, screaming, fighting and so much more. My mentor teacher literally threatened to quit today. I won't go into it much more, because tomorrow I have a midterm in one class and 10 page paper due in the other.    Will update more soon, probably this weekend, after I get everything done and have had some sleep.
