Wondering were I've been?  I've been hanging out with the family, and not having a chance to update.  Which frustrates me.  I like to get things out.  I like to write out my thoughts even if they don't make sense.      I was flirting with a friend online today.  It started out cutesy and ended with a possible proposition.  Then I have to wonder if I'm being... hypocritical.  He has a girlfriend, she's 19 and he's 27.  I don't take that seriously, which is probably wrong of me.  The thing is I've had a thing for him for fifteen years.  I just don't want to admit that he's not available.  Then again if he's talking to me the way he was, how serious can he be about this girl?  I know I'm just making excuses.  I don't know.  It would be easier if I knew her.  Easy to just say no.  But when she's this faceless nobody in Florida... it's easier to say yes.  Of course maybe he was just kidding.
