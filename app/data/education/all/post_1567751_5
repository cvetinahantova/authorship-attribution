Imprints on rainbows –  dark shadows in a brief life 	spoil the coloured years.                   Waves on brown sand dunes –  mark the oscillating days  	of passing moments.	 	 	Fragile veins on leaves –  ephemeral lives on earth 	snapped broken by Fate.  	Faith held tight and close –  transitory prints in life 	are made eternal
