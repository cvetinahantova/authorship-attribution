Greetings in the name of Jesus!  hi friends,  soon after finding an apartment with two faithful Christian brothers (Chris and Aurum), God provided for me a job at the YMCA. i began helping as a temporary bus driver for the program. as time went on i became a more regular bus driver and helper for the program. second semester, the person i was helping left and i took over as Coordinator.   in addition to the responsibilities i had before, as Coordinator of the Fun Pass program, i had to plan monthly activities, update families with what was going on and take on full responsibility of the students and program. as i took over, a rapid growth in attendance occurred. this was worrisome and stressing for me. the majority of the students were first time Fun Passers, as i was, so we had to get used to one another. though there was only one of me, there were days where i had to take charge of 20+ junior high students. but i can testify that God is good and has taught me a great deal through this experience.   as the school year comes to a close for my students and me, there is a dwindling of attendance. part of the reason is the warming weather and the disciplinary problems some students have, at school/home, with parents.   i am now debating if i will return as Coordinator or just come in as an assistant. i want to stay in these students' lives, but i also want to choose where God wants me to be. i havent seen fruit of change of heart, but i feel confident that God has placed me there for a reason. i just want to share God's love for these students. i feel convicted that many people dont see that love without the committment behind it.   we must live consistant, Christ-like lives.
