Kainis! Layout in the office took longer..about a week. Finally got my internet connection this morning...sayang, just when I was getting the hang of this blogspot.I miss putting an entry..half a month din pala I didnt put anything.  It's 7:20pm, I'm still in the office. I'm still waiting for myk. Supposed to teach him how to do a website for our finals on Friday. para lang may ma-submit. Heheheeh. Aarg!!! May final paper pa pala. I wonder if our groupmates found a topic na? I emailed them this morning...  Guess what? We found THE ring yesterday. Actually, we're having it made pa. We'll be getting it on Saturday, June 19. Myk and I had to attend a wedding last Saturday so we couldn't do our weding stuff. Yesterday, he picked me up and as per other wawies' advices, we went to megamall. 3 and a half hours later, we still havent found the ring we wanted. He finally said, "Let's go to Greenhills" ---- first thing that crossed my mind : TIANGGE!!! But no, that had to wait. The ring first. 3 shops and about 2 hours later, we stumbled upon LORENZO. It's near the entrance in the mall near the cinema. I let Myk do all the talk. Quoted us at 38k. (Gosh!) Gave us a 10k discount (Darn, still way too high). Then we told them that our budget was at 20k and we'd pay right there and then if they gave it to us. We had to call the owner. Guess what, he gave it to us at 20k. Myk and I were sooo happy. Super naka hinga ng maluwag. Such a big accomplishment.
