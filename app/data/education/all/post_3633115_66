I now can say that I comprehend how it is that some people are "self taught" site builders.  It really isn't all that difficult as long as you know what the different things are that you want to do.  Of course...isn't that the case for everything?  Really though, I'm starting to understand how it is that people start in the business of website building.  I am acutally finding the different things about it fun.  I feel a sense of accomplishment when I realize that a new link on the sidebar was something I installed myself.  Ahhh...here it is.....my moment of Zen.
