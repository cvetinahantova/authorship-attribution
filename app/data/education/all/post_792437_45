Just a thought...   Haha..I wonder how people perceive people too absorbed in what they do? I mean I like teachers who love what they teach..but what do others think?  I think I'm becoming a crazy fanatic teaching Micro TA..hahaha, wonder if my students think I'm some freako with no life but bacteria........ahhhhhhh!
