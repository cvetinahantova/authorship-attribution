Christmas break is a great time of the year ;)  But even though I don't want to I have to go back to school on the 8th.  Oh well, the only thing that I am worried about are finals.  See we were supposed to have finals on the last day of school before Christmas break, but it snowed too much and we had to miss.  They have changed our calendar and everything to make up for that day.  We were supposed to go back the 9th but now we have to the 8th, that sucks.  Yesterday we took down everything related to Christmas and put it away until next year.  This is awful early for us to take things down, but my parents wanted to take the decorations down, so I had no choice.  I thought I was going to break my neck when I was up on the roof trying to take down the lights, one wrong move and I would have killed myself.  And just to add to the fun there was snow and ice on some parts of the roof as well.  At least I am alive.  Everyone in my family is sick.  I don't feel too bad, but I don't feel perfect or anything.  I am just glad that I don't have to worry about homework right now or anything.  That is a big relief.  Although sometimes I do put off my homework until the morning at school.  I am just happy that I get to spend some time at home with my family and don't have to worry about getting up early.
