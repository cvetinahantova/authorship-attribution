Seriously. I'm not sure whats wrong with me. For the past 2 or 3 weeks I have been wholly unable to fall asleep at a normal time. Despite forcing myself to wake up at a normal early (by my standards) time, I have not been able to get on a regular sleep schedule. Its quite frustrating. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. But I can't. I've tried reducing my caffine, tried doing a PM strech routine, triedall sorts of stuff and nothing seems to work.  Perhaps I am stressed. I don't feel particularly stressed. I mean I do have a master's thesis that I am supposed to finish by August.  And I am working on 4 other projects for my research assistantship. I'm not quite sure what my summer deal is yet or how much money I will make. I have class presentation due this week. I am single and I hate it. I'm going to buy a new car. I want to lose 5 pounds but I can't seem to get my self motivated enough to diet. My current car sucks and I am afraid will break soon.  But seriously, I'm not stressed.  Maybe I am. I don't know. Tonight I was convinced that I was going to fall asleep. I was almost there and then I thought about how Jennifer Hudson TOTALLY should not have been voted off  urlLink  American Idol   since she clearly was the best singer in the whole competition and then I was bothered and couldn't sleep. If stupid  American Idol  is all I have to keep me awake at night then I should be doing alight.  But I'm not.   urlLink  postCount('108261359831918338');
