Boarding the Singapore airlines plane was a tear filled goodbye for Rachelle and Family, both Sonia and Ron weren't their usual sunny selves as Rachelle and I walked through the departing passenger's gateway to the land of duty free goods. Rachelle had the presence of mind to ask for exit seats - that is seats just behind an exit door where one has the luxury of slouching as much as want and stretching legs out as far as possible, something I had taken for granted on the first league from Auckland to Singapore Airport. Tim (one of my fantastic flatmates in Hamilton) will appreciate the huge amount of people who carried iPods with them, something that was not necessary on the Singapore flight as the place has excellent entertainment facilities. You may watch any number of "Recent" movies from "The last samurai" to "Love actually" The movies are played at your personnel request via a little remote control, and as everyone has their own TV screen in front of them, you have absolute freedom when choosing what to watch and when. The entertainment facilities also has a huge range of episodes from pop soaps like CSI, Scrubs, West wing, Friends etc. along with a built in Nintendo entertainment system there is more hours of entertainment than there is flying time. "Flight also gives you the opportunity to watch on screen your GPS flight information.  Including altitude, time, date, speed, head wind speed and a good idea of who the lights below you belong to.  This did give me the shits a little especially over and around the Middle East countries"  -shell
