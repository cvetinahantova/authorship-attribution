Mood: Calm, Happy  Listening To: Laura - Scissor Sisters  Had a chat with Jo(Ursuline Variety) very nice girl, though people dislike her for being too kind, hmmm. Either way I'm not going to say anything bad because she helped put things into perspective. I need to branch out more, whilst relying on Aidan isnt too fruitful, although can be, and relying on Jo, whilst she can be excellent company, her sharing her time with Ben isnt leaving me too happy. Relying on any of the ventures for social activity is like speaking to a brick wall.  Lord knows WHERE I'll branch out to...  But I'll be wanting to get a job, probably in sutton as it's pretty damn close and I know my way around. I'll have to look around, maybe over the half term...mmm..  AH, English Lit test tomorrow, 2 hours 15 mins of unadultarated FUN FUN FUN[/sarcasm]  Bit of a short one today...maybe an update later, I'll leave you with a tip top from Jo,  " Just remember that you are the only one who can live your life and that you will only get out what you put in: put in good, the outcome is good "
