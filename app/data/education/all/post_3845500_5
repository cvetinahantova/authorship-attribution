It has been a couple of weeks since my last post here. The reason for this is simple. On July 8th I had a call from my Dad to say that my Mum, who had been in hospital for about a month, had deteriorated sharply. She passed away from the effects of ovarian cancer at 4:50pm on the 9th with all her family around her. She will be deeply missed by many people, including me. Rest well, Mum, you've earned it.   I learnt today that there has been a  urlLink helicopter crash in the Kelabit Highlands of Sarawak , one of the Malaysian parts of Borneo. Bario, the centre of the Kelabit Highlands, was where I did my teaching stint with  urlLink Trekforce  last year. It looks as though the village has been turned into the centre of an intensive search and rescue effort. It has now been twelve days since contact was lost with the helicopter, but if the passengers survived the initial crash there must still a good chance of their rescue.  Water is not hard to find, and that alone can increase the chances of lasting until found by the search operation.  Finally, very many congratulations to Caspar and Becky on the birth of wee (3lb 12oz, about 1.7kg) Susannah Rosemary Furner on Tuesday afternoon.
