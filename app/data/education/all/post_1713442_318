urlLink Immersion in Australia: an information literacy health spa for librarians?  This is by Irene Doskatsch.  It was published in  Australian Academic & Research Libraries , Volume 33 NÂº 3, September 2002.  From the site:  Abstract: The establishment of the Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) Institute for Information Literacy Immersion program was partly in response to the laments of influential US university library directors who publicly stated that many new librarianship graduates did not have the skills and knowledge to competently adopt the educative role. The author reports on the results of an informal survey to ascertain the desirability and suitability of an Immersion program for Australian and New Zealand librarians and describes her experience of the ACRL Immersion program. The role of the Australian and New Zealand Institute for Information Literacy (ANZIIL) in facilitating Immersion style programs is also discussed.
