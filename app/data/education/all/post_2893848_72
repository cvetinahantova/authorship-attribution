Chabon is still a Fraud   By IJ   A number of you, via comment and email, have taken issue with my appraisal of Michael Chabon.  It seems, then, that further attention to this matter is merited.  My complaints with Chabon center largely around two elements to his style.  One, his writing prioritizes a seeming novelty over an actual substance.  There's a real dissonance between each image and all the images in aggregate.  There is no consistency I can see beyond the novelty of each.  There's nothing holistic about it; its like flipping through five hundred channels of television, stopping on each long enough to transcribe a line of dialogue, and then calling the whole thing an epic poem about the human condition.  Two, even if I am sure that stylistic novelty is a virtue in the greater context of substantive fiction, I don't think Chabon is all that novel.  I find it interesting (and troubling) that Chabon is identified as some sort of generational voice existing in diametric opposition to writers like "Updike and Orwell," the old guard, as it were.  I don't think that's good enough.  Chabon is feeding us the same shit in a new bowl.  There is still the realization of an expected effect, a flat and presumed mysticism to the mundane, and ultimately, an abject familiarity to all of it.  Now- we wouldn't read fiction if we didn't know that we enjoy reading fiction, and with that comes a reasonable expectation of what it will look like.  I'm not, exactly, calling for a revolution.  But there's something that makes me uncomfortable about the overestimation of novelty.  Perhaps it is a simple consequence of  business, but the ratio of products claiming to be novel : products that are genuinely novel is absurdly large.  It all smacks a little too much of being told how to think for one's self.   So I'm going to stick to my guns on this one.  Chabon still isn't good enough.  Not that he's bad, mind you, just not good enough.
