I woke up this morning at 10:55 after spending the whole night editing and revising chapters 1-8. I had a terrible headache. I woke up, dragged myself out of bed and took my comforter up to the couch where I sat and layed all morning watching OnDemand movies. Gangs of New York and Chicago, and half of my own copy of Secret Window. I felt so sick. Then I went running with Tina again. Today was our easy day, so we only did four and a half miles. Tomorrow night my dad and I are going to go see "King Arthur". My rule is that only great movies start on days that aren't Friday. Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, Star Wars (this one wasn't so great...it was the exception), and hopefully King Arthur. I go to see Lancelot...played by Ioan something or other. He was in the A&E series a few years back as Horatio. YAY!
