Now that I've given a short, but sweet version of our last couple of years, I will keep this part more up to date.  Right now 2 of my children are deep in the middle of rehearsal's for a play, Anne of Green Gables.  They are having a good time.  I didn't get a part this time and I have been kind of bummed about it, but it's a humbling experience to look on instead of being involved.  I'm sure it will help me understand them better when they have to look on.  We all fight for our time on the computer, which is kind of a pain.  So, not only do I spend time on the computer, I have started another hobby, knitting.  I'm working on an afghan right now.  I just finished a baby blanket for my niece's new baby.  I mailed it on the way home from school today.  I hope she likes it and understands that even though there may be mistakes, I put some of myself into it.
