Hey! How is everyone? I'm fine. Ok, we have almost everything straightened out for the concert tomorrow night. All we need to know now is if Melanie can spend the night at Lauren's house.  Today is picture day at school. I don't think I did very good on it, but oh well. I'm wearing my "Jesus is my homeboy!" t-shirt.... man, I have gotten like at least 10 comments on it. Yay! That is good... I mean EXTREMELY good. Health, boring. English, boring, but Colleen broke her bracelet cuff. lol... that was hillarious. I mean, I'm sorry. Lunch, wonderful as always. Drama, funny because of Thaddeus Warren and his wild stories. We have a paper to write about "A Day In The Life of Sarah Deringer"... well, everyone wrote about a day that they had. I wrote about the July 25th Slingshot 57 concert. But it's different from the last one. And much better. Spanish, boring. Biology, boring. I probably should be taking reading notes now, but we have all weekend to do it. So ok, I have Saturday maybe to do it. Well, I'll try and get some of it done tomorrow in my free time. Or on the way to the concert. Hopefully, we drive the van. Geometry, I got it done! Yes! Ok, so I should probably do my Biology homework, but really I don't want to. So I won't till this weekend as much as I can.  All right, the next entry is my assignment of the concert... hehe...  Silent
