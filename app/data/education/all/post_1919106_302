During the last week I've noticed that the Google text ads at the top of my blog started showing links to sites related to parrot training. Which is rather funny, considering that I never talked about parrots. Or training. Of course, a title like "Your Eclectus Will Obey" brings all kind of ideas to mind if one doesn't know that Eclectus is a parrot. I wonder if they use  urlLink the crab  to teach them.
