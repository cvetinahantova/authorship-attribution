urlLink Monthly Review January 1998 Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward    Coauthor of "Regulating the Poor" and "The Breaking of the American Social Compact" and a distinguished professor at the Graduate Center of CUNY, Piven said today: "Tax cuts were supposed to spur recovery, but jobs are not recovering, the unemployment rate remains high, and more and more people appear to be dropping out of the labor market. Meanwhile, the programs created over the course of the 20th century to shield people from labor market instabilities are being whittled away. The Republican majority in the Congress stalls on the extension of long-term unemployment insurance, the president proposes to make welfare (which has always been the unemployment insurance program for less regular workers) harder to get, and harder to keep, and housing subsidies and even earned income tax credits are slashed. This is not a compassionate conservative regime; it is a hard right regime."
