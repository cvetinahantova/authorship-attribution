Ok, I need to clear this up, soemone left a comment a couple of posts down, that I took as completely innocent. Renee took it as completely innocent.    Tommy read it and did not take it so innocent.  He took it as someone offering to service me.  To put things nicely.    So I am deleting the comment.  I don't know what was meant, innocent or not, but Sorry, not interested.  Not even in flirting in any way shape or form.  Life is crazy enough around here without having that to worry about.
