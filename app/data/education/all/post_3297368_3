Hello Friends and Onlookers,  Nothing too special to report today other than I have updated my profile with a picture of myself and my fearless dog.  I guess you can put a face on "faceless" from now on.  The picture is not the best picture of the lot, but it is a good picture of me and my dog, Nihanni.  We call him "Honey" for short.  He is an American Eskimo Miniature (Miniature Spitz is the more politically correct term).  He is a veritable ball of white fur, and I have often thought of making a sweater out of him.  Believe it or not, we managed to find him at the local SPCA animal shelter.  I know what your thinking; who in there right mind would give up such a beautiful dog?  Well, it was not from a lack of love.  The previous owners left explicit instructions about how to care for him, from how to play with him to what snacks he likes.  We spoiled him pretty badly.  At first he chewed everything.  I lost a watch, a shirt, a very expensive goretex jacket, and more.  We literally had to barricade all the rooms.  Did I mention he could open doors, drawers, and even closets?  It was quite a transition that first year.  On the bright side, Honey is a beautiful dog.  He draws complements from complete strangers, creating opportunities to meet new people.  A weekly tradition of mine is to walk along the waterfront and enjoy the weather.  On another note, my friend  urlLink Lola  was trying to post a comment.  Her blog is titled  Can you dig it?   I have hopefully fixed the error so you can begin posting comments.  It's after midnight, and I have to get up early for work.  More interesting stuff to come...  Regards,  Faceless Butcher
