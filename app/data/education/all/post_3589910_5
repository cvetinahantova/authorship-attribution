Every time I go to a website to see if I can find any prompts to write about, I always stumble across the old cliche question, "What is love?". I've found it so many times I just couldn't think about anything to write on that. But on the afternoon I was singing Hillary Duff's song "love just is". So I just saw the same prompt and well, decided to answer it. What is love? Everyone looks for an answer to that. Scientifics say is an expression of feelings, or whatsoever. Lovers say is what you feel when you find Mr. or Mrs. Right. Religious people say is the truest manifestation of God or a higher source of any kind. Depressive people say is painful and not worth it. The truth is... There's no explanation, no definition. Love, like the song say, just is. How can we give a true definition for something so wonderful yet so painful. Yes, it is the most powerful feeling of the world. But it still don't have a true definition. Love just is, whatever it may be... Nothing less and nothing more... So stop asking the one you truly love and truly love you why do they love you. There is no answer for that kind of question. Some question don't have answers. What is love? Love just is.
