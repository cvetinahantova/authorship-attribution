One fine day  all the thoughts inside my head will turn away from dread I will want to get out of bed  My life would finally blossom if I saw my microcosm as awesome I would no longer be annoyed while lost in my emotional void  My head would be sober and my pain would be over I would stop fooling myself and care more about my health  I would reverse my polarity and would feel truly free  No more away messages sappy with rhymes so childishly crappy
