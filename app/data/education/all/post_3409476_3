Well, I didnt get the job.  They "chose" someone whose department is being dissapated.  It really is a let down, this is one I really wanted.  I hate when they interview for show.  I know there are laws and union contracts and you have to interview everyone eligible, but those of us who understand that you would prefer someone or you have to place someone should be told ahead of time so we dont get our hopes up!  AArrgghh!  It is just frustrating.  So my next move is to put my resume out to the real world again.  I hate to leave the district, great beneifts and vacations and all but I also will hate to lose 2 months worth of pay.  On a happy note.  Adam has his reservation for Cleveland, the boys are all flying together on Thursday morning.  After an hour and a half layover in Nashville they should arrive in Cleveland about 9pm.  The opening ceremonies are on Friday with Aaron Carter singing the National Anthem (Megan doesnt understand why Adam isnt thrilled) and President Bush making an appearance.  Truthfully I would feel safer if he just stayed as far away as possible.    Yesterday was pretty uneventful, laundry all day before the cruisers return and take over the machines.  Then practice for Adam.  When we arrived at 5pm someone asked the coach what time to come back and pick up his kid.  The reply was "DARK".  Well at this time of year that can be anywhere from 7:30 - 9:30 so us girls went to the movies.  We picked up Kayla on the way and went to see Cinderella Story.  WHile not a bad movie, it is not something I would have seen if not for Megan (age 12) and Kayla (age 9).  But is was air conditioned (quite cool actually) and dark and quiet so all in all it was very relaxing.
