I chatted with a friend on the ICQ yesterday. We talked about family burden. I told him that he had too many 'guy's concern'. During the little discussion, he corrected my comment.  It's not the first time I was told that I am too judgemental and make comments without thinking carefully. I wondered if I am so poor in hiding my 'fox tail' or it's so easy to be seen. No one sends me such a comment in my daily life but I received more than once in my daily cyber life. What makes such a difference? What does it imply?  I guess I am not as good as I thought in receiving messages by word. Life is easier when I can see your eyes and gestures. Or people don't, or dare not express themselves face to face?
