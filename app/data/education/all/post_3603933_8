I am teaching Sunday School to 4th and 5th graders tomorrow.  The topic: Samson and Delilah, the story from Judges where Samson reveals his weakness to a woman and God takes away his strength. Here is an example of why I do NOT follow the curriculum. (This is straight from my curriculum book given to the Sunday School teachers) **** Teacher Says:  Let's play a game to find out how Samson might have felt about listening to Delilah's constant nagging.  Instructions:  Have kids form groups of five to ten and stand in a large circle.  Choose one person to be "Delilah."  The players standing in the circe will be "Samsons" and will hold their arms up in a strong pose.  Have Delilah go from player to player inside the circle and try to lower each of the Samsons' arms while saying in a sad, whiney voice, "Oh, Samson!  What makes you so strong?"  Encourage Delilah to use dramatic facial expressions or a silly voice and to push or pull down on each Samson's arms to make him or her laugh and become weak.  AFter Delilah has succeeded in weakening each of the Samson's in the group, choose another Delilah and continue the game until everyone has had a turn to try to weaken the Samsons. ****  Who writes these curriculums?
