Thursday, May 15, 2003    Dean, the candid candidate, pays visit  Looks like Dean is picking up steam.      By SAM SKOLNIK SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER  Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean found a wildly receptive audience last night for his speech to more than 1,200 faithful at Seattle's Town Hall.    The former Vermont governor received several standing ovations from the standing-room-only crowd for his attacks on President Bush.    �  � Dean    "This president's foreign policy is not consistent with our values," Dean said. "Saddam Hussein was a despicable person, but the doctrine of preventative war is going to come back and bite us some day."    Dean, who was introduced by former Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, his honorary state chairman, came in from Portland earlier in the day and did some fund raising before his speech. He leaves Seattle today.    Dean, a medical doctor, is one of nine candidates vying to oppose Bush in the 2004 election. He began the race as a distinct dark horse, but has sharply raised his national profile by being outspoken in his opposition to the Iraq war.    Dean offered lots of red meat to the crowd by shooting at Bush's foreign policy, his economic plan and what he called the president's divisive rhetoric.    He said he took personal offense at the language Bush used in January when he came out against the use of affirmative action by the University of Michigan in its admissions process.    "This president has set us against each other, not just by race," Dean said, but on the basis of religion, gender and socioeconomic status.    In a briefing afterward with reporters, Dean said Bush was not a racist, but that by referring in his speech to the Michigan policy six times as a "quota," a loaded catch phrase for many, "it was the first time he appealed to racial divisiveness -- and that was just wrong."       OAS_AD('Middle2'); //-->    OAS_AD('Middle3'); //--> Dean, up until recently known mostly for his anti-war views, has been branching out on issues. Earlier this week, he proposed an $88.3 billion plan to expand existing health care systems.    His plan also would cut tax breaks for corporations that don't provide health insurance to workers.    Although many of Dean's stances are seen by supporters and detractors as tilted toward the liberal end of the Democratic Party spectrum, he told reporters he didn't believe his more conservative views on gun control would hurt his chances among Democratic primary voters.    While Dean, 54, said he supported the assault weapons ban and the Brady Law, and that he is in favor of closing the "gun-show loophole," a federal check for buyers at gun shows, he said other gun-control policies should be left up to the states.    He said he didn't believe that tougher gun-control policies that may be well suited for Seattle or New York would work -- or should be forcibly enacted -- in rural states such as Wyoming or Vermont "because they don't need it."    Rachel Jackson, who recently moved from Missouri to Seattle with her husband, said she had liked what she had heard about Dean but was won over by his speech and is now a committed supporter.    "He's the most eloquent speaker that I've seen," said Jackson, 26.    Dean, who has been rapped by his detractors for possessing sharp campaign-trail elbows, avoided directly criticizing his primary opponents last night. But if anything, he said his plain-spokenness should be seen as a virtue.    "You will never leave a room without knowing where I stand on an issue," he said. "You may not agree with me, but you'll know."    P-I reporter Sam Skolnik can be reached at 206-448-8176 or samskolnik@seattlepi.com
