Haha school ended early today so went with a couple of my friends to BK at Holland V to eat.. Hmm... What can i say about them?? They're absolutely terrific.. Crazy and wacky bunch of ppl who can only think of.. ahem ahem..YOU know what i mean haha.. The sad part was that Yanfang fell down.. Deep cut and she had to struggle all the way to the MRT station.. Yanfang, take care wor.. We share lots of light-hearted moments but i'm very afraid that i won't complete my projects on time.. It's like half the time we are fooling around instead of doing serious work.. But they're comical and i prefer them to stay that way.. It makes life a little more interesting and easier to go by..
