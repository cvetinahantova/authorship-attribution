This human body so racked with desire unfulfilled, seeking to release it all into the light of eternal awakening, seeking to release all earthly want to the vast expanses of divine joy.  But my body calls me back with vision that stops and stares and takes in hungrily anything sensuous, carnal, lustful and wants to romp there, gladly soaking in the sweat of another, the scent of another, the taste.  If I linger too long, spend too much energy on the fantasy, it is entirely possible, no probable that I will eventually fall prey to the illusion, that I will seek out that which is unattainable.  Except for returning inward there would be no escape and though pleasure comes, pain follows quickly...today I've still got to convince myself that I seek the higher road, that I don't need to indulge my selfish desire, that I don't need to wallow in the excess of flesh and rush of blood.  Today I will wash my face in the shallow pools of redemption that have gathered about me in the pits of my former despair.  I will bathe luxuriously in the sweet grace of divine inspirition.
