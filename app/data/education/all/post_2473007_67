Well, in an unexpected turn I found internet access in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains, but only for a few moments, so here is a basic rundown of my week so far.  I drove all day Saturday through Pennsylvania and Virginia and watched the sun set dusty rose on the Shenendoah Valley.  I entered Charlotte, North Carolina around 10pm and saw the quarter moon rippling over the water.  The house where I'm staying is on the very summit of one of the Blue Ridge Mountains and I woke up this morning to the sun streaming across the mountains and flooding the bedroom.  The drive up was frightening, but well worth the view.  Time to run, but I'll try to fill in everyone in a few days!
