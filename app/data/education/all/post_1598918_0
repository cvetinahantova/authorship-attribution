WHY KAZAA IS BAD NEWS FOR THOMASU   Here are a few reasons not to download/use file sharing software (such as  KAZAA ) on campus.  Not only is it illegal to share intellectual property such as a popular song or movie clip, but  urlLink the RIAA has begun to prosecute KAZAA users .  There is also a bill in congress  urlLink (`Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2003')  that, if passed, will bring the federal government into the hunt for copyright infringement.  So, downloading music that you have not paid for is illegal.  And software that allows such trading should not be on campus computers.
