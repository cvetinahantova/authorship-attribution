the sky above the sky   I see me sinking through the dark nights when the stars leave the sky give up the lights give up to try  But the gloomy river said its nights are darker than mine since there�s no moon willing to shine  Then the trees whispered the story of the darkest nights when the clouds keep blowing in between the deadly freezing winter wind  we�ll always have our own darkest nights but only if we let our eyes free to see it�s never been darker than others, truly   (Romeo & Juliet, Kissing you, Instrumental) above all sadness. enschede, end of january 03
