Well, yesterday was culmination and today was the last day of school.  We had a bonding session during something called "Magic Circle."  I went around tyo each student and said something nice about them.  WE cried and cried.  Most of the boys cried.  It was so sad.  A lot of these kids will never see each other again.  I told them that they were my first class and I will never forget them.  THat when they come back to visit when they are graduating from high school and getting ready for college, although i may not remember their names, I will always remember their faces.  I got a couple of cards from some students and they were really sweet incredible words that you would never know these kids could come up with.  Very loving, honest words.  I will cherish these words forever.  On to the new year!  SChool starts in a couple of weeks and as I was driving home today, I was sad for my old kids, but excited at the prospect of a new class; a new beginning, more experiences.  Its kinda cool because I know who most of them are going to be.  So, it's going to be great.  I'm gona try a "Hogwarts" Houses team thing. I'll have them in the sorting hat thing, and they will be sorted into their house for the year.  Of course, they will work with other houses, but they will do core things with their team.  So I'm excited.  So tired...ta ta for now...
