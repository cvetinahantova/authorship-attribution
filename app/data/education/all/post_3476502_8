Music: Burn - The Cure Mood: gothic... ********************  I'm dancing around to The Cure... and I feel very... enlightened and gothic....   I put on black lipstick, fixed my hair, put on my most gothic outfit, and now I'm dancing... I'm loco..!  I need to get my contacts out... glasses don't work well with my gothic image...  *sigh*  ::spins around:: My look next year is going to skirts... >.>... skirts, and hoodies or baggy shirts... yeah... w00t...  I'm gonna go now... love all!
