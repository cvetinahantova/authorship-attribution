Yesterday was one of the best and worst days of my life. I finally have a job I will enjoy doing. I'm glad about this daycare business. I totally bottomed out yesterday and I had to get some stuff sorted out with that but other than that I'm doing pretty good. Keeping a smile up as much as I can and praying that it will all be alright. I'm in Computer Apps. right now, bored and just thinking a lot. I do that too much, but I learn a lot. I miss you all very much (well.......most of you) and hit me up some time.
