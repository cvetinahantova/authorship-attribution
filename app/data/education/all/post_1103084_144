................... more theory ...................  i have a theory, but its just as much a question as it is a belief (at least at this stage).  why do people care?  about anything?  why do they lend their lives to certain jobs or institutions or places or groups?   that's the question my theory answers.    here's the theory:    everyone has -- at their core some kind of deeply embedded conflict.  This conflict may have caused them a great deal of pain in their youth, or it may have just been a fear that's been simmering forever unsaid.    so everyone does -- something that addresses that pain or that fear.  What people do with their lives offers themselves the best reassurance that they are solving the problem, addressing the problem or facing the problem.   and i mean *everyone* (remember its a theory and a question).   so i don't believe that there are people who do things because its the easy way out or because its what was expected of them or because its the only model they ever saw.    I think all those factors focus and direct the kinds of choices we make, but ultimately, i'm suggesting that everyone's life should be read as: motivated action.    (i'm not saying that people have as many choices as they want to have or that they have concious control over most of their choices.)  so what?    hmm.  i don't know?  its a therapeutic model for me.  i gradually recognize more and more how everything i choose in life is organized across the same fault lines.    ~peace.
