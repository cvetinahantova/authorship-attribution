written as an answer to a challenge of making a -happier- addicted-to-love poem, :)  and here it is...    ~*~   fumbling towards ecstasy...   you are the morning adoration a fresh dew to my heartache  you are the brightest shine of the sun a light to the darkness of my shadow  you are the warmness of the sunset a convection to my cold icy heart  you are my one twinkle star a great inspiration to my lost soul    ... when you step into my day!
