Cape Haze, Florida - It has been some time since I last wrote, but I am here in Florida visiting my pledge brother from college, Matt White.  In January of 1999, Matt was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  Although it is a terminal disease, Matt has shown me how one can live through adversity and get the most life out of living.  After all, Matt chooses to live until the moment he dies.  And even then, he lives.  Spending time here is a blessing.
