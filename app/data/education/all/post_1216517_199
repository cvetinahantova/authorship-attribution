I am in finca ixobel.  It�s this little ranch in a rain forest in the northern peten region of Guatemala. Anyway, as per my comments and the responses on �mere Christianity,�  I�ll be posting quotes once I return stateside, but one thing that interested me was his comments on thrills in live.  That hit me big time.  Searching for thrills in travels, in relationships.  He mentioned letting the thrill die and settling in to a quiet satisfaction I think he called it.  The whole thing was really thought provoking anyhow.  I�ve recently been really motivated to do something.  It�s a big step, my friends.  Because for the most part, save for the occasional spontaneous outbursts of energy and creativity, I am a pretty lazy so-and-so.  What is this �something� that I want do to, you ask.  I have not a clue.  Be it a job.  Possible.  Overseas work.  Possible.  Frankly I don�t know, but there is something welling up inside me that is saying, �dmh, you need to get off your hindend and DO something.�  I have this voice around from a while, but now he/she is really beginning to turn up the volume.  Have I ever mentioned my desire to be a monk/  well that phase has come and gone and I was never really into it as much as drew was anyway.  But now I�m on a new kick, the pilgrim.  I think I should be a pilgrim for a while, not he hats and turkey and Indians and all that, my friends, but kind of a journeying, wayfaring, spiritual pilgrim.  You know visit the holyland and other far off holy sites in Siberia or somewhere equally remote.  Hmm.  I think I maybe over this phase as well, but it was worth a try. Side note.  In the 2000 US presidential election 105 million votes were cast.  In this year�s American Idol finalist vote there were 65 million votes cast.  Yeah, I�m gonna be sick. Side note number 2.  Fattest region of the county.  The deep south, especially Mississippi.  Leanest.  West and New England. There�s no special significance to any of this, I just read a time magazine yesterday though
