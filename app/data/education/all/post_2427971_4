Came back from Nate's yesterday, had so much fun. Played mostly BF1942, if not that then Savage(wierd but fun game) or COD(WW2). It was harder for Nathan when we left than anyone else, he misses Bend and all the friends he used to have. Least while we were there we had fun, that's what matters. Drive back was alright, Zak's mom was bitching for a while 'cause she had to wait for us... Yeah, that's too fucking bad, gee we're sorry... not... Yeah, so oh well, whatever. Afterwards when I got home I thought I wouldn't be able to see Katherine, it was sorta late etc... But she proved me wrong, so I went to her house and we extanged gifts. I got her a bobbly Patrick, a dragon figurene, caffiene and two itailian charms... One was of Spngebob and Patrick, and the other was a gold rose with emeralds and diamonds(she liked that one the most ;). She got me a CD/DVD of a really good stand-up comedian that I like, also 28 days later(fricking awesome zombie movie, she didn't understand why I liked it so much). I was really tired from staying up all night the night before so Kat and her mom were trying to get me to fall asleep... Now is it me or does that make no sense at all, falling asleep while your at someones house visiting them... My girlfriend none the less. So yeah, went home and watched the Dane Cook DVD she got me. Really funny, no clue how she found it. Didn't sleep as long as I wanted but oh well, maybe tonight... Probably not, considering it's Christmas. Anyways, that's all I can think of to write about atm... Yeah, it's not much at all, sry Kat. Kinda braindead right now. Merry Christmas!
