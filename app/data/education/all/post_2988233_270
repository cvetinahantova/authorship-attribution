AFter I wrote my post last night about wanting a tat, I sent to bed.  Didn't do my normal blog hopping until this morning.    Well, seems as if everyone is having a crisis of some sort,  urlLink Ren , wants a tat,  urlLink Jenn  wants one, and while talking to a friend today, she mentions she wants one too, exact same place as me, even the same motif.    What is with us?  Now to lose that weight to bet my belly ring.
