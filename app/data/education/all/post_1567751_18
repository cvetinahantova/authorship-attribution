The more wretched your life was, the closer you were to the truth, to the gritty nub of existence...  ~ Timbuktu, Paul Aster  I agree with this statement. Children with problematic families generally mature faster. My sisters and I did.   The more wretched our lives were, the closer we were to the Truth. Now, just change the small 't' to a capital 'T'. The more wretched we were, the more we need God. In ugliness, we witness His beautiful goodness.   Amazing grace, how sweet the sound   That saved a wretch like me!   I once was lost, but now and found   Was blind but now I see!
