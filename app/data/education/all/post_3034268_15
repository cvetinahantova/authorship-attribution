Guests can now respond to my posts.  This means that there can be actual conversations on this blog now, and as you all know, I love a good dialogue.  Conversation is the meat and wine of life.  We had our weekly philosophy club meeting today.  Our topic today was the origin of values.  Where do our values come from?  Are they universal or do we create them?  Is life valuable?  How do we create and change values?  Does everybody understand what honor is?  What  is  honor?  What are we supposed to do when our values clash with those of others?    I think that from a universal, or "eye of God" perspective, there are no values.  Whether someone is insulted, cheated, murdered, or betrayed, or whether they are honorable, charitable, and honest, is irrelevant from the universal point of view.  They are essentially valueless acts and behaviors.  However, as humans, faced with the obstacles that society, and even bare existence presents us with, we must create value, and these are worth striving for.  Being honorable and honest is of higher value than cheating and betraying, because of the way that individual humans give meaning to these concepts.  Is this artificial?  That will depend on what one means by "artificial," but I would say that the meaning we give these concepts is certainly very real.  Even if it is artificial, we shouldn't assume that that automatically has less value...if you think it does, then you should ask yourself where that value comes from.  I'm clueless on that.
