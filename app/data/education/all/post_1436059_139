'Allo folks. Happy Saint Patrick's day to you all!  I made Irish Lace Cookies last night and brought a few to school today. Some people liked them, but Ryan laughed and said they tasted like cereal with the oats and brown sugar. LoL. It's true, though, I guess. Not my recipe though! The hardest part was getting the damn cookies off the cooking sheet when they were done in the oven. They're so thin and connected by bits of brown sugar/butter or whatever, and they crack and crumble if you're not careful.  Anyway, moving on.  In Theatre Arts we learned about makeup. Krystle did Lindsay's makeup to make her look like a rosie-cheeked three year old, and I did Jacob's makeup to make him look like a really old man. Lindsay turned out great, but Jacob looked more like he was dead than he did an eighty-year old man.  Ech. Spanish was kind of boring today. We had a timed write where we had to describe 'un monstruo' (monster) or 'una persona con muchas partes de el cuerpo' (a person with a lot of body parts). When we were done we paired up and we had to read our description to our partner, who, in turn, tried to draw the monster (All of this being conducted in Spanish, of course). Mine looked really scary. Five elbows, polka-dots, and arms that are longer than legs tend to do that.  Math was boring So was lunch. So was Biology.  Ugh. Track sucked. Track hurt so bad.  Now I'm tired. :-)   SEVEN DAYS UNTIL THE FIRST MEET OF THE OUTDOOR SEASON!!!! WHOOT!!!!    Feeling:  Happy, cheerful (as usual) but extremely and excruciatingly tired.  Eating:  Nothing, but I'm so hungry!!!  Drinking:  YO BEBANDO EL  AGUA !!!!!!!!! SI!  Mad At:  *grumbles* damn Maryland weather. Freaky weather...  Listening to:  My Uncle's newest CD, "Only a Fool".  Writing:  Meh. This and that...MUST GO TO LIBRARY!
