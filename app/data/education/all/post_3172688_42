Hey! Oh I can't wait! Mom said that she is considering letting me go to the other school that I want to go to! Isn't that great? If you would of seen me earlier today you would think that I was the living-dead, Hickville style, but I can't stop smiling now! This just may be my one chance to actually fit in! Itâ€™s hard to think that my parents will actually let me do something like this... I mean they (act like) they don't like change and like they don't want me to experience change because I have lived in the same town all my life, in the same house, and had my whole school life planned out from day one. It feels so good knowing that I will  finally  be able to experience a little change! Anyways I just wanted to share the good news! Now I think I'm going to go back to reading my book... LOL... Bye!
