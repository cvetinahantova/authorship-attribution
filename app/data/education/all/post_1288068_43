On my first day at school I was a bit late but Ms said it was okay as some of the other NQTs were even later anyway. Then they gave me a pain au chocolat which is like a kind of pastry with chocolate in the middle. And a cup of orange juice or water  -  I took water.  Then Ms gave us loads of paper and I had forgotten to bring a notepad so I had to write on the back of my papers but I suppose I can write it all down somewhere better later. We had a tour of the school it was good although some of the children stared at us. They are probably quite nice really I suppose I would stare too if I saw some people I had never seen before in a place that is full of people.  At break we got to go in the 'Staff Room' which is where all the proper teachers go. The teachers were nice except for one teacher who told me off for being in the 'Staff Room' until he realised I was not a Sixth Former. I was scared but I made a joke. The joke was rubbish but he laughed anyway.  Then I had Art, it is my best subject. They put me in a classroom with no other people. I was supposed to sit in the teacher's chair but it felt a bit cheeky so I sat at a pupil desk instead. I looked in some cupboards which were full of jelly moulds and things because they used to teach cooking in the art department. There was no paint or brushes or paper. Or pencils or glue. Or pens. Maybe they are somewhere else.  At the end of the day we had a talk about Pastoral Care, which is about when you have to go to assembly and things. We got biscuits and tea or coffee. I had tea. At the end of the meeting I went outside with a naughty American NQT who wanted to smoke a cigarette but had to do it in secret because it is not allowed in school. I did not smoke a cigarette though.  I went home on the train. I really liked my first day in school, it was good.  Then I woke up and it was all a dream ... or was it?  By Jenny aged 23
