Okay, so two weekends ago I was up in Hokkaido at the amazing yuki matsuri.  I told you a bit about it in my last email, but if you want to check out the official site:  urlLink http://www.snowfes.com    You`ll soon be able to see all of the ice and snow sculptures that I witnessed up close and personal.   Hopefully soon I will provide another link to some of my pictures as well as those taken by my friends capturing all of the fun and crazy moments!
