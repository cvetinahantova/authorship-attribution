Borrowed that line from Disney's animated movie Robin Hood.  Over the past days things weren't good on the blog.  I was trying to figure out a friend.  Instead of figuring out him, I more so allowed him to understand me more.  At least, that's what it looks like.  But I actually talked to Josh tonight.  I told him my problems.  He responded.  He says we're good now.  And I feel better cause I was true to myself and honest.  Thanks for putting up with it.  Everything's good now.  Can't wait to hang out with everyone again soon!
