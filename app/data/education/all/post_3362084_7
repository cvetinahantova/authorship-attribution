I would not say I am stuck in Lodi like the song, but I am back here for those that I haven't talk to in a while.  Starting to adjust to having dad and derrick pop in and out of the house.  Haven't seen his gf or any of his "friends" lately.  Everyone is going about their business and I've thus far stayed out of trouble(knock on wood).  Only two more weeks and than Japan trip!!!!!
