I have to admit it, I'm a computer geek. I guess in my trade as an IT Teacher I almost have to be, but I go far beyond the realms of normal geekdom into the geek atmosphere.  Now don't get me wrong, I don't look geeky or really act all that geeky (in public), but I definitely am a geek.  What brought this on? I  urlLink read  today that  urlLink DELL  the worlds largest OEM of computer/accessories has begun to sell Desktops with  urlLink LinSpire  (a Linux distribution) to the mass market in Europe.   So what? Well, for those of us that have had virus scares, hacker nightmares, bugs, crashes, blue screens of death, software not working, slow unresponsivecomputing, and the inability to use open source software it's a huge deal. It means that finally Linux is starting to gain more acceptance in the main stream. Currently they hold a 25% marketshare in the Server OS, however, only geeks like myself and the brave and adventurous choose to run a Linux distribution duel or single booted on their home systems. (ie:  urlLink Mandrake ,  urlLink Suse ,  urlLink RedHat ) If you haven't tried Linux, then it's definitely worth the effort to give it a try. It's much more customizable and secure, not to mention the open source software and applications available are much better than anything Microsoft could offer. Now with LinSpire the ease of installation has come full circle, and it's painless. Installing software on LinSpire is easier than even Windows with their patented CNR technology. You can even run the entire OS off of a single CD-Rom by downloading and burning the Live CD from urlLink  here .  I'm one very excited cookie. It's about time that Microsoft had some serious  competition, and it's now only a matter of time before other large OEM manufacturers start selling Linux boxes outright without fear of the repercussions from Microsoft.  Viva la Linux Revolution  RLB
