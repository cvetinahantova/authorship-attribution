those snickers commercials are driving me crazy! they are just making fun of little old ladies trying to tell them that the only way they can get guys is by giving them candy. ppl go to jail for that sort of thing!! well.. if they let them out.. i only made that mistake once..  so i went to fun house tonight! i got to meet Phil. he's really cool. i watched him play ddr.. omg i have never seen anyones legs move like that before. John has been teasing me all night about Phil.. that's what brothers are for! and for once in my life i didn't have my zippo on me.. when i got home i lit stuff on fire to say sorry for leaving it behind.. yay pretty fire. (*note to self get more fluid*)  so while i was there Chris called and interupted my air hockey game with Andrew (i still won 7-4 haha) he said he would try to see me tomorrow when i go pick up Sadie. i'm kinda thinking about telling him not to bother. how crappy is that? "I'll try to see you". bull! i'm not gonna be the convienent girl friend.. ya know the one that's just there when they want you there and gone when they don't need ya.. what about me? i know this sounds crazy but sometimes i need someone too. i hate being the one that fixes everyone's problems because that just means i have no one to help with mine.. and i hate that none of my bfs ever want to just hang out. it's like all we do when we're together is make out.. that really sucks! stupid horny boys! i want to have a guy who will sit down and watch a movie with me. and i mean WATCH it the whole thing even if it sucks. sorry about whining tonight guys. i'm just annoyed at the fact that the guys that like me never treat me right..
