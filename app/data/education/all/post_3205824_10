I’m just back from watching Fahrenheit 451 at the Georgetown theater.  I wonder if you’ve had a chance to see it in Cambridge.  Everyone is cheerfully saying, well, the Left finally has its Rush Limbaugh, and who cares how accurate it is.  I hear a lot of chatter about the conspiracy theories forwarded in the movie (a little silly maybe), but not a lot of discussion about two pieces of social commentary I heard most clearly: 1) that those fighting this war for us are recruited from the very bottom of American society, that their pay is decreasing, and we seem to have an armed contingent of slave-laborers defending American freedom (think about arming slaves in Rome for a minute and forget social justice. Just think about security).  2) that GWB sees –himself- foremost as a member of a class of international elites - “the haves and the have-mores.”  Something has gone seriously wrong with the American rhetoric of democracy.  Can you imagine any postwar president until Reagan using this rhetoric?  Even Reagan on film would be shocking.  “Identity” studies has failed completely if we don’t register the significance of this kind of self-identification reaching the US.  It was, however, good to see the film in Georgetown rather than in Berkeley.  Impassioned conversations between serious-looking people all the way back.  A woman with a heavy French accent protesting to her boyfriend as they walked their bikes up the hill.  Had it screened in Berkeley, the crowd would have laughed, sobbed, jeered at all the same places, and one would leave the theater with the same heavy feeling: there is nothing to be done; not here; none of you even know a Republican.
