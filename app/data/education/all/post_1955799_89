Yesterday, there was some rennovating about the house.  I was so sleepey when the people came to work, that I slept through their time here.  I got up, and they were ready to work on the windows.  Lord, my room looked a mess.  I had to scramble and make things look neater, so they could get though and finish the  windows.  The windows look nice now.  LOL  :-)  Bought new blinds for the windows.  One of them doesn't fit my window.  Have to take it back today, and get a larger one.  Talk about anti-climatic.  LOL  Still working on my porfolio for graduate school.  I also want to take more photography classes, so I can expand upon some ideas I have about creativity.    An  ex-friend called me recently, but I don't think I want to talk to her anymore.  A lot of things have changed between us.  Namely the fact that she tried to start a conversation as if nothing has happened between us to make us stop speaking to each other.  What does she really want?  I don't thin I'll ever ask.  I don't want to know.
