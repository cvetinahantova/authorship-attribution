Tonight I was just sitting here, having a discussion about My Restaurant Rules at www.tvaus.com when suddenly, out of the blue, I am caught up in a whirlwind about relativity. Belladonna said some comments about Nick and Emily, two people on the reality tv show. Sam, who is Nick's brother in real life, got angry and the two started arguing. Here's a bit of transcript.  ______________________________________________________________  Belladonna wrote:   Again, we are from *different worlds*   You don't have to like my opinion, you just have to respect it    ______________________________________________________________  Smiffyjo wrote:  Alright perhaps I'm being belligerent but I'm sick of this word 'opinion' being chucked around like it vindicates everything.  I don't get this 'just giving opinion' thing. Just because someone is just giving opinion doesnt mean it is justified or given nicely. Opinions can be wrong factually and morally. And so no I don't even have to respect your opinion and if you don't believe me think of Hitler. Does anyone really think his opinions deserved respect? His opinions were wrong factually speaking and morally speaking. And if you really want to be tripped out.. do you respect my opinion that not all opinions deserve respect?  ______________________________________________________________  tntnnbltn wrote:   You certaintely do like to use Hitler as an example often.   But the only reason we see Hitler's opinions as being wrong factually and morally is becaue ours are different. If you had the same opinions then you would think the opinions of everyone else are wrong morally and factually. Society has deided that what we believe to be right is right and whatever we believe to be wrong is wrong. I'm not saing that Hitler should be right. I'm just saying that in some alternate universe someone might be saying how wrong morally and factually Abraham Lincoln's ideas were, and that Hitler was the true pioneer of the world. It all depends on a combination of past history and present society.   ______________________________________________________________  smiffyjo wrote:   HAHHAHAAHHA  You are right I do use the example a lot   Alright this is fun... I use the Hitler example a lot cause it is an example where people usually cant help but concede that there is something to some opinions being wrong. You however have stuck to relativism (cheers on consistency  )  Alright where to begin?  mmm dont want to bore people. I'll start here: If Hitler has won the war and managed to convince everyone that the Jews and Gypsies werent real people would the world (objectively and factually speaking) be a different place? Would for instance the Jews and Gypsies BECOME less then human?   ______________________________________________________________  I did that? Is that a good thing? Oh well, better play along with it now.    If that scenario was true then it would be believed that they were indeed less human, although there would be some who would disagree, I'll grant you that. In our current world however they are considered equal, although there are some who do disagree. I guess that your question can't be answered to any degree of certainty, especially seeming you did not specify wether they are less human from our perspective or their perspective. They way you worded it sounds [in my opinion  ] that you were asking whether they were less human in our eyes just because they are less human in the eyes of those in the proposed scenario. Alternatively, you could've been asking whether in the eyes of the people in that world whether gypsies and jews were less human. Each answer would be different because of the different beliefs of right and wrong.   To think of this in a different way were African Americans less human in the past? Today we would say no, they were always human, always equal. In the past we [implying the dominant 'white' people] would've said no, they're not as human. Then in the middle it would've been all blurred as opinions (there's that word again) change. Then you have the opinions of the African American's themselves, which I'm not even going to attempt predicting (seeming how I'm neither African American nor in timeframe I'm talking about).  ______________________________________________________________  I never realised I was so insightful. I wonder if it happens in real life too? I'm readily waiting for a reply...
