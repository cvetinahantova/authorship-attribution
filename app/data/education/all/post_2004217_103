urlLink    Me at dad's wedding (that's Em in the background). I've just downloaded Hello Bloggerbot or whatever it's called, so I thought I'd add a picture; I like this one because I think I look quite pretty, as opposed to other pictures where I tend to look fat, or I have a stupid grin on my face. Don't ask about the thing on my head. Long story.Â  urlLink     The sun has returned, and I feel distinctly less down. I was up until about 2.30am last night feeling sorry for myself (and also very warm, strangely enough), and I wrote a little, which made me feel better, like I was getting it out of my system. I think my mood has also lifted partly due to talking to a guy called  urlLink John  yesterday, who made positive comments in my direction, which made me feel a bit better. I've still downloaded the latest Linkin Park album though, just in case.  I have spent today sizzling (and revising) away quietly in the back garden, smiling politely and telling the lady from No. 11 for the fourth time (at least) that I'm going to either Leeds or Sheffield in September. In a mo I'll shuffle into the bathroom in my fish-shaped flip flops (Heeeee) to apply copious amounts of Sainsbury's After Sun Tan Maintainer, in the hope that tomorrow morning (supposedly the hottest day of the year so far) I won't wake up equally as white as I did today.  Ceff x   I don't know what's worth fighting for, or why I have to scream, but now I have some clarity, to show you what I mean
