in a word cirque du soleil last night was absolutely amazing!  my description won't do it justice... i'll have to see about scanning in photos from the program or something.... the whole show was water based, i.e. the stage was a semicircle pool that got shallower or deeper depending on what was going on -- sychronized swimmers in really cool costumes, fire jugglers, high divers, trapeze artists, you name it... like i said, my description won't do it justice!  arlene and her boyfriend adam got her last night just in time for supper -- they walked the strip while eric and i were at the show... it's so good to see her again!  and he's a pretty nice friendly guy to hang out with for the day now too (as if someone arlene was seeing wouldn't be :-P)... yay for semester abroad reunions after a year and a half! :-)  this is my last stop i'll have internet for awhile... in the meantime you can think of me oohing and aahing at the following stops along the way :-P  today: finish packing eric's car, drive all 4 of us (me, eric, arlene, adam) in 2 cars from vegas to north rim of the grand canyon, possibly camp for the night, at least definitely see sunset!  friday: leave arlene and adam to enjoy the canyon... drive from grand canyon to salt lake city, see the salt lake, stay with eric's REU roommate drew in salt lake  saturday: drive from salt lake to yellowstone (new states on the way include idaho and montana :-) ), hopefully be there at the right time to see old faithful... at least be there to enjoy the park itself... stay somewhere around cody, WY probably.  sunday: drive from WY to rapid city, SD, see mount rushmore, stay in SD  monday: drive from SD to minneapolis, MN... stay with michelle collins!  and the fun only continues from there, but that will get told another time :-P  an excellent week to you all! =)
