Hello Hello. OMG! One of my friends mentioned about Carmen Sandiego and its been in my head for a while now. Hahaha. But seriuosly how can she hide for soo long? I would get mad at her on every episode. They kids would find out her evil polts but they couldnt stop her either way. God damn that whore! She made me mad. I tryed my best at getting her. But I failed. Ugh...But my friend caught her. She has her in the closet. She asking her questions. If Carmen Sandiego doesnt give us the answer we want she earns a slap. Hahaha. That's what Carmen Sandiego gets for hiding all the time and wasting my time looking for her ass. Anyways. Yeah its Spring break and I hate it. I have nothing to do. I sit in my room listening to Bikini Kill or Bratmobile. I cant find my other cds. Which sux by the way. Yeah. Have I mentioned that Im in a band? Well yeah its called Who's 2 Blame? Heres more info on us. We do our original songs. We sometimes cover Bikini Kill and Bratmobile. I play drums. Sometimes I sing. Our vocalist is Allie, 15. Shes great and fun to be around. She cant sing all professonal but she knows how to fucken yell. Our guitarist is Andy, 14. Hes barely learning guitar but hes already good at it. Hes good at playing one string. Thats his specialty.
