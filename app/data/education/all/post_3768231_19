Catching up.. .  I caught 
  up with a local family this evening. I stayed with them when I was 
  first separated, and house-sat their place over one Xmas holidays too. 
  I haven't seen many of my old church associates since moving back here, 
  but I thought it was about time to catch up with these people at least. 
  They're a few of the good ones. They invited me over for dinner, after 
  we'd been swapping a few email messages lately. It was a really good, 
  relaxed, low-key friendly fun evening of just hanging out together, 
  talking refreshingly. I felt really comfortable - it was a big positive 
  for me. Obviously, I haven't been doing enough of this kinda thing 
  lately, so it was good for me to 'break the ice' for myself to start 
  catching up with these people again, after such a long time.
